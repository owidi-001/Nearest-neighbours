'''Portugal''' ({{IPA-pt|puɾtuˈɣaɫ|lang}}), officially the '''Portuguese Republic''' ({{lang-pt|República Portuguesa|links=no}} {{IPA-pt|ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ puɾtuˈɣezɐ|}}),{{NoteTag|In recognized minority [[languages of Portugal]]:
:* {{lang-mwl|República Pertuesa}} }} is a country located on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in [[Southern Europe|south-western Europe]]. It is the westernmost [[sovereign state]] in [[mainland Europe]], bordered to the west and south by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the north and east by [[Spain]], the sole country to have a land border with Portugal. Portugal’s territory also includes the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], both [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] with their own [[regional government]]s. The official and national language is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. [[Lisbon]] is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city.

Portugal is the oldest [[nation state]] on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in [[Europe]], its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. It was inhabited by [[pre-Celtic]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples, visited by [[Phoenicians]]-[[Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and ruled by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the invasion of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Moors]], most of its territory was part of Al-Andalus. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of São Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of León|León]] was recognized by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jenkins, Spyros A. Sofos, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LNRyNG9NNkcC&amp;lpg=1 ''Nation and identity in contemporary Europe''], p. 145, Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0-415-12313-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal established the [[Portuguese Empire|first global maritime and commercial empire]], becoming one of the world's major economic, political and military [[Education superpower|powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Eugene Page, Penny M. Sonnenburg, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, today referred to as the [[Age of Discovery]], Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration with the discovery of what would become [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] (1500). During this time Portugal monopolized the [[spice trade]], [[Treaty of Tordesillas|divided the world into hemispheres of dominion with Castile]], and the empire expanded with military campaigns in [[Portuguese presence in Asia|Asia]]. However, events such as the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], the country's occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the [[Independence of Brazil|independence of Brazil (1822)]] erased to a great extent [[Economic history of Portugal|Portugal's prior opulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/portugal/|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese Civil War|A civil war]] between [[Liberalism|liberal]] constitutionalists and conservative absolutists in Portugal over royal succession lasted from 1828 to 1834.

After the [[5 October 1910 revolution|1910 revolution]] deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable [[First Portuguese Republic|Portuguese First Republic]] was established, later being superseded by the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974), ending the [[Portuguese Colonial War]]. Shortly after, independence was granted to almost all [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|its overseas territories]]. The [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|handover of Macau to China]] (1999) marked the end of what can be considered one of the longest-lived colonial empires in history.

Portugal has left a profound cultural, architectural and linguistic influence [[Evolution of the Portuguese Empire|across the globe]], with a legacy of around 250 million [[Lusophone|Portuguese speakers]], and many [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Portuguese-based creoles]]. It is a [[developed country]] with an [[Developed country#IMF advanced economies|advanced economy]] and high [[living standard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=8 April 2014|title=World Economic Outlook April 2014 - Recovery Strengthens, Remains Uneven|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/pdf/text.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408225045/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/pdf/text.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2014|access-date=20 April 2021|website=imf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/public-sector/deloitte-au-ps-social-progress-index-executive-summary-2015-90415.pdf|title=SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX 2015 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY|website=2.deloitte.com|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp|title=Quality of Life Index by Country 2020 Mid-Year|website=www.numbeo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it ranks highly in [[World Index of Moral Freedom|moral freedom]], [[Global Peace Index|peacefulness]], [[democracy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/en/news-publications/democracy-reports/|title=Democracy Reports &amp;#124; V-Dem|website=www.v-dem.net|access-date=14 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621135623/https://www.v-dem.net/en/news-publications/democracy-reports/|archive-date=21 June 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Press Freedom Index|press freedom]], [[List of countries by Fragile States Index|stability]], [[Social Progress Index|social progress]], and [[Legatum Prosperity Index|prosperity]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Anta de Arca.JPG|thumb|right|Chalcolithic Dolmen ''Anta da Arca'']]

The word Portugal derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name [[Portus Cale]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/portugal|title=Portugal – Origin and meaning of the name Portugal by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a city where present-day [[Vila Nova de Gaia]] now stands, at the mouth of the [[River Douro]] in the north of what is now Portugal. The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbour, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/31989410|title=Documentos danca portuguesa|first=Marcos|last=Winicius|via=www.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names ''Cale'' and ''Callaici'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/10819665|title=Origem e significado dos nomes de Portugal e da Galiza|first=Luís|last=Magarinhos|via=www.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te1YDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=gallaecian+druid+culture&amp;pg=PA9|title=Europa Sun Issue 4: April 2018|first1=Carolyn|last1=Emerick|first2=Various|last2=Authors|publisher=Carolyn Emerick|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory proposes that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''caladh'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''cala''. These explanations, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted because the region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic, usually considered P-Celtic. However, scholars like Jean Markale and Tranoy propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul, Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Alarcão |first1=Jorge |title=Ainda sobre a localização dos ''populi'' do ''conventus Bracaraugustanus'' |journal=Anales de Arquelogía Cordobesa |year=1998 |pages=51–58 |url=https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10396/2852/9.3.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/originesetmigrat00peti|title=Origines et migrations des peuples de la Gaule jusqu'à l'avènement des Francs|first=Émile|last=Petitot|date=11 July 1894|publisher=Paris : J.

Another theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'', a supernatural hag). Some French scholars believe the name may have come from "Portus Gallus",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&amp;pg=PA441|title=Manuel géographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the port of the Gauls or Celts.

Around 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]]. In the process they conquered Cale, renaming it Portus Cale ("Port of Cale") and incorporating it in the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with its capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around Portus Cale became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as ''Portucale''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into ''Portugale'' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', ''Portvgallo'' or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as ''Portugal''.

The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in south-western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]].

The region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref name="Birmp1"&gt;David Birmingham (2003), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, they did form organized societies. Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals, the raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing.&lt;ref name=Birmp1/&gt;

It is believed by some scholars that early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] invaded Portugal from Central Europe and inter-married with the local populations, forming [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|different tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=So1mDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=different+celtic+tribes+in+Portugal&amp;pg=PA63|title=Portugal: Third Edition|first1=Jay|last1=Heale|first2=Angeline|last2=Koh|first3=Elizabeth|last3=Schmermund|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-1-5026-1694-4|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garstk |first1=Kevin |title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature.

Based on the Roman chronicles about the [[Callaeci]] peoples, along with the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/leborgablare01macauoft|title=Lebor gabála Érenn: The book of the taking of Ireland|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|publisher=Dublin : Published for the Irish texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}
The first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:
"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon."

There were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]–[[Carthaginians]].

=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===

[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of Évora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]

Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].

The Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and
the lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unrv.com/bio/viriathus.php|title=Viriathus And The Lusitanian War &amp;#124; UNRV.com Roman History|website=www.unrv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY5ABAAAQBAJ&amp;q=viriathus+celtic+lusitania+academia&amp;pg=PT268|title=Viriathus: And the Lusitanian Resistance to Rome, 155–139 BC|first=Luis|last=Silva|date=30 July 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-4738-2689-2|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrested control of all of western Iberia.

Rome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail – the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.

Rome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.

In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conejo |first1=Noé |title=Coins and ''villae'' in late Roman Lusitania: collapse of the Roman currency economy? |journal=Post-Classical Archaeologies |volume=10 |year=2020 |pages=219–246 |url=http://www.postclassical.it/PCA_Vol.10_files/PCA10_Conejo.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].
Some urban remains are quite large, like [[Conímbriga]] and [[Miróbriga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Conímbriga lies {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.

Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found. Contemporary historians include [[Paulus Orosius]] (c. 375–418)&lt;ref&gt;David Rohrbacher, "Orosius," in ''The Historians of Late Antiquity'' (Routledge, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TLvK-_fk8TkC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Orosius+life+OR+biography+OR+born+OR+birth&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U2atlXMBUN45DliVbnt_fLlckZInw pp. 135–137.] Rohrbacher bases the date of birth on Augustine's description of Orosius as a "young priest" and a "son by age" in the period 414–418, which would place his age at 30 or younger.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hydatius]] (c. 400–469), bishop of [[Aquae Flaviae]], who reported on the final years of the Roman rule and arrival of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].

About 410 and during the 6th century it became a formally declared [[Kingdom of the Suebi]],&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; where king [[Hermeric]] made a peace treaty with the Gallaecians before passing his domains to [[Rechila]], his son. In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].
After the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457–459) reunified the kingdom. He was assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.
Although the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:
[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459–463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459–469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463. He would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.
By the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.
After the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.
The dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550–559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeeded by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559–570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.

[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]

The councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (São Martinho de Braga).&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qa3DReKkS_gC&amp;q=kingdom+of+the+suebi+braga+academia&amp;pg=PA8 |title = Canonical Collections of the Early Middle Ages (Ca. 400-1140): A Bibliographical Guide to the Manuscripts and Literature|isbn = 978-0-8132-0918-0|last1 = Kéry|first1 = Lotte|last2 = Kery|first2 = Lotte|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570–583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.
The Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.

In the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583–584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584–585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6500&amp;context=etd |title= The development of church/state relations in the Visigothic Kingdom during the sixth century (507-601) Kingdom during the sixth century (507-60}|last= Osborne|first=Jason|date=2016 |website=ir.uiowa.edu|access-date=11 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doges at this time were related to the monarchy acted as princes in all matters. Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo). These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711. King [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia. From the various Germanic groups who settled in western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fim do Império Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|access-date=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|access-date=12 March 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Head |first1=Brian F. |last2=Semënova-Head |first2=Larisa |title=Vestígios da presença sueva no noroeste da península ibérica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na língua |trans-title=Traces of the Sueva presence in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula: in ethnology, archeology and language |language=pt |journal=Revista Diacrítica |date=2013 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=257–277 |url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0807-89672013000200016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.
Bracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Apart from cultural and some linguistic traces, the Suebians left the highest Germanic genetic contribution of the Iberian Peninsula in Portugal and Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hay |first1=Maciamo |title=Genetic history of the Spaniards and the Portuguese |url=https://www.eupedia.com/genetics/spain_portugal_dna.shtml |website=Eupedia }}{{self-published inline|date=November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], at that time resident in Hispania, shows a rather pacific initial settlement, the newcomers working their lands&lt;ref&gt;"the barbarians, detesting their swords, turn them into ploughs", ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', VII, 41, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or serving as bodyguards of the locals.&lt;ref&gt;"anyone wanting to leave or to depart, uses these barbarians as mercenaries, servers or defenders", ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', VII, 41, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic period and the Reconquista ===
[[File:Al Andalus - 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 10th century]]

Today's continental Portugal, along with most of modern Spain, was part of [[al-Andalus]] between 726 and 1249, following the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |title=Al-Andalus |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Al-Andalus |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=19 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of present-day Portugal fell into the hands of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]] of the [[Aftasid Dynasty]], and after a short spell of an ephemeral [[Taifa of Lisbon]] in 1022, fell under the dominion of the [[Taifa of Seville]] of the [[Abbadids]] poets. The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the [[Almoravids]] who came from [[Morocco]] in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]], followed a century later in 1147, after the second period of Taifa, by the [[Almohads]], also from [[Marrakesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Portugal musalman (Le) – VIIIe-XIIIe siècles par Christophe Picard – Maisonneuve et Larose – Collection Occident Musulman – 2001, 500 p. {{ISBN|2-7068-1398-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Al-Andaluz was divided into different districts called ''Kura''. Gharb Al-Andalus at its largest was constituted of ten kuras,&lt;ref name="A. R. Disney, p.55"&gt;A History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire, Vol. 1: From Beginnings to 1807: Portugal (Volume 1) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; each with a distinct capital and governor. The main cities of the period in Portugal were in the southern half of the country: [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]], [[Alcácer do Sal]], [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and [[Lisbon]].
The Muslim population of the region consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to [[Islam]] (the so-called ''[[Muwallad]]'' or ''Muladi'') and berbers. The Arabs were principally noblemen from [[Syria]] and [[Oman]]; and though few in numbers, they constituted the elite of the population. The [[Berbers]] were originally from the [[Rif]] and [[Atlas mountains]] region of North Africa and were nomads.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

=== County of Portugal ===

{{Main|County of Portugal}}

[[File:Porto April 2019-18.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.8|left|A statue of Count [[Vímara Peres]], first [[County of Portugal|Count of Portugal]]]]

An Asturian Visigothic noble named [[Pelagius of Asturias]] in 718 was elected leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pelayo-king-of-Asturias|title=Pelayo – king of Asturias|website=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; by many of the ousted [[Visigoth]] nobles. Pelagius called for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, better known today as the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], in what is today the small mountain region in north-western [[Spain]], adjacent to the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref name="V. Livermore, 1969 pp. 32-33"&gt;H. V. Livermore, ''A New History of Portugal'' (Cambridge University Press: London, 1969) pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelagius' plan was to use the Cantabrian mountains as a place of refuge and protection from the invading Moors. He then aimed to regroup the Iberian Peninsula's Christian armies and use the Cantabrian mountains as a springboard from which to regain their lands. In the process, after defeating the Moors in the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in 722, Pelagius was proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the war of Christian reconquest known in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as the ''[[Reconquista|Reconquista Cristã]]''.&lt;ref name="V. Livermore, 1969 pp. 32-33"/&gt;

At the end of the 9th century, the region of Portugal, between the rivers Minho and Douro, was reconquered from the Moors by the nobleman and knight [[Vímara Peres]] on the orders of King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]. Finding that the region had previously had two major cities – [[Portus Cale]] in the coast and [[Braga]] in the interior, with many towns that were now deserted – he decided to repopulate and rebuild them with Portuguese and Galician refugees and other Christians.&lt;ref name="QuidNovi"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Ângelo |last2=Hermano |first2=José |title=História de Portugal I&amp;nbsp;– A Formação do Território |trans-title=History of Portugal: The Formation of the Territory |publisher=QuidNovi |year=2004 |isbn=989-554-106-6 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from the Arabs from the South, the coastal regions in the North were also attacked by [[Normans|Norman]] and [[Viking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oliveira |first1=Leandro Vilar |title=A presença viking na Península Ibérica: Os Vikings em Portugal e Galiza (Hélio Pires) |trans-title=The Viking presence in the Iberian Peninsula: The Vikings in Portugal and Galicia (Hélio Pires) |language=pt |journal=Scandia |date=2018 |volume=1 |pages=249–255 |url=https://periodicos.ufpb.br/index.php/scandia/article/view/43168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marques |first1=André Evangelista |last2=Barroca |first2=Mário |last3=Amaral |first3=Luís Carlos |chapter=As incursões vikings no Norte de Portugal |hdl=10216/120557 |title=Mil Anos da Incursão Normanda ao Castelo de Vermoim |isbn=978-989-8351-97-5 |pages=143–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; raiders mainly from 844. The last great invasion, through the [[Minho (river)]], ended with the defeat of [[Olaf II Haraldsson]] in 1014 against the Galician nobility who also stopped further advances into the County of Portugal.

[[File:Henri de Bourgogne reçoit l'investiture du comté de Portugal, 1094 (Claude Jacquand, dit Claudius; 1841).png|thumb|right|[[Alfonso VI of León]] investing [[Henry, Count of Portugal]], in 1093]]
Count Vímara Peres&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/23317651|title=O Conde Vímara Peres por A. de Almeida Fernandes|first=A. de Almeida|last=Fernandes|via=www.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized the region he had reconquered, and elevated it to the status of [[County]], naming it the [[County of Portugal]] after the region's major port city – ''Portus Cale'' or modern [[Porto]]. One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimarães]] – the "birthplace of the Portuguese nation" or the "cradle city" (Cidade Berço in Portuguese).&lt;ref name="QuidNovi"/&gt;

After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted Vímara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portugália'' – the [[County of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="QuidNovi"/&gt;

Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III "the Great" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of León|León]].

In 1093, [[Alfonso VI of León]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his illegitimate daughter, [[Teresa of León, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of León]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors. Henry based his newly formed county in Bracara Augusta (modern [[Braga]]), capital city of the ancient Roman province, and also previous capital of several kingdoms over the first millennia.

On 24 June 1128, the [[Battle of São Mamede]] occurred near [[Guimarães]]. [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], Count of Portugal, defeated his mother [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]] and her lover [[Fernão Peres de Trava]], thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso then turned his arms against the Moors in the south.

Afonso's campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was unanimously proclaimed [[King of Portugal]] by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of León, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].

Afonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. Afonso was recognized in 1143 by King [[Alfonso VII of León]], and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]].
[[File:D. Afonso Henriques - The Portuguese Genealogy (Genealogia dos Reis de Portugal).png|thumb|upright=0.80|right|[[Afonso Henriques]] was the last [[Count of Portugal]] and the first [[list of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] after winning the [[Battle of Ourique]] in 1139. (''Depicted in a 1530s [[illuminated manuscript]]'')]]

During the [[Reconquista]] period, Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Moors|Moorish]] domination. Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.

In one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alcañices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]]. This treaty established among other things the border demarcation between the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of Leon, where the disputed town of [[Olivenza]] was included.

The reigns of [[Denis I of Portugal|Dinis I]] (Denis I), [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] (Alphons IV), and [[Peter I of Portugal|Pedro I]] (Peter I) for the most part saw peace with the Christian kingdoms of Iberia.

In 1348 and 1349 Portugal, like the rest of Europe, was devastated by the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/09/13/2031252.htm|title=Black death|first=Karl S.|last=Kruszelnicki|date=13 September 2007|website=Abc.net.au|access-date=2 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1373, Portugal made an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with England]], which is the longest-standing alliance in the world. Over time, this went far beyond geo-political and military cooperation (protecting both nations' interests in Africa, the Americas and Asia against French, Spanish and Dutch rivals) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies. In the [[Oporto]] region, in particular, there is visible English influence to this day.

}}

In 1383, [[John I of Castile]], husband of [[Beatrice of Portugal]] and son-in-law of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal]], claimed the throne of Portugal. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by [[John I of Portugal|John of Aviz]] (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]] defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. With this battle, the [[House of Aviz]] became the ruling house of Portugal.

Portugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the [[Age of Discovery]]. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], son of King [[John I of Portugal]], became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the [[Atlantic Ocean]], discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]]; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern [[Portuguese India Armadas|route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]]; [[Colonial Brazil#Discovery and early exploitation|discovered Brazil]], explored the [[Indian Ocean]], established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to [[Jorge Álvares|China]] and [[Nanban trade|Japan]].

In 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering [[Ceuta]], the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.
[[File:Henry the Navigator1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry the Navigator]]]]
Throughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#Expansion of the Portuguese empire (15th and 16th centuries)|several common types of tradable commodities at the time]], ranging from [[gold]] to [[slavery|slaves]], as they looked for a route to India and its [[spice]]s, which were coveted in Europe.

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of [[Christopher Columbus]], was made by [[Pope Alexander VI]], the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the west coast of Africa).

[[File:Ignoto portoghese, ritratto di un cavaliere dell'ordine di cristo, 1525-50 ca. 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Vasco da Gama]]]]

In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] accomplished what [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] set out for and became the first European to reach [[India]] by sea, bringing [[Economic history of Portugal|economic prosperity to Portugal]] and its population of 1.7&amp;nbsp;million residents, and helping to start the [[Portuguese Renaissance]]. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] reached what is now [[Canada]] and founded the town of [[Portugal Cove-St. Philip's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonizations of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/portuguese.html |title=The Portuguese Explorers: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |access-date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/corte_real_miguel_1E.html |title=Corte-Real, Miguel |first=L.-A. |last=Vigneras |volume=I |access-date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcsp.ca/?Content=Visiting/About_Our_Town/History|title=Town of Portugal Cove – St.Philip's : History|website=Pcsp.ca|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] discovered [[Brazil]] and claimed it for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;The standard view of historians is that Cabral was blown off course as he was navigating the currents of the South Atlantic, sighted the coast of South America, thereby accidentally discovering Brazil. However, for an alternative account of the discovery of Brazil, see [[History of Brazil]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]] in India, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Strait]], and [[Malacca]], now a [[States of Malaysia|state]] in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the [[Indian Ocean]] and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of [[Timor]], and in the [[Moluccas]].

Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the [[Philippines]] in 1521.

The [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.

All these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.

=== Iberian Union, Restoration and early Brigantine era ===

{{Main|Iberian Union|Portuguese Restoration War|House of Braganza}}

Portugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union between 1580 and 1640. This occurred because the last two kings of the [[House of Aviz]]&amp;nbsp;– King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]], who died in the [[battle of Alcácer Quibir]] in [[Morocco]], and his great-uncle and successor, King-[[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Henry I of Portugal|Henry of Portugal]]&amp;nbsp;– both died without heirs, resulting in the [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580]].

Subsequently, [[Philip II of Spain]] claimed the throne and was accepted as Philip I of Portugal. Portugal did not lose its formal independence, briefly forming a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms. At this time Spain was a [[geographic region|geographic territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/9858/1/1812Cadiz.pdf|title=Peña, Lorenzo.

Instituto de Filosofía del CSIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of an independent foreign policy and led to its involvement in the [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the [[Netherlands]].

War led to a deterioration of the relations with [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|Portugal's oldest ally, England]], and the loss of [[Ormus|Hormuz]], a strategic trading post located between [[Iran]] and [[Oman]]. From 1595 to 1663 the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese [[colonies]] and commercial interests in Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian sea trade monopoly.
In 1640, [[John IV of Portugal]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]] ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which reigned in Portugal until 1910.

In a palace coup organized by the King's wife, [[Maria Francisca of Savoy]], and his brother, [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro, Duke of Beja]], King Afonso VI was declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores and then to the [[Sintra National Palace|Royal Palace of Sintra]], outside Lisbon. After Afonso's death, Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II. Pedro's reign saw the consolidation of national independence, imperial expansion, and investment in domestic production.

Pedro II's son, [[John V of Portugal|John V]], saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonies]] of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranhão (colonial)|Maranhão]].

Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V acted as an absolute monarch, nearly depleting the country's tax revenues on ambitious architectural works, most notably [[Mafra National Palace|Mafra Palace]], and on commissions and additions for his sizeable art and literary collections.

Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition, John also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe, the most famous being those he sent to [[Paris]] in 1715 and [[Rome]] in 1716.

Official estimates&amp;nbsp;– and most estimates made so far&amp;nbsp;– place the number of Portuguese migrants to [[Colonial Brazil]] during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000.&lt;ref name="ibge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |title=IBGE teen |publisher=Ibge.gov.br |access-date=11 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125045233/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |archive-date=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies in the Americas during colonial times.

=== Pombaline era and Enlightenment ===
{{Main|History of Portugal (1640–1777)}}
[[File:SebastiãoJoseph.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]] effectively ruled Portugal as an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened despot]] during the reign of King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]].]]
In 1738, ''[[fidalgo]]'' [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo]] (later ennobled as the 1st [[Marquis of Pombal (title)|Marquis of Pombal]]) began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London and later in Vienna. The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Maria Anna of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria]], was fond of Carvalho e Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed Carvalho e Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal|John V]], however, was not pleased and recalled Carvalho e Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]], was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of Carvalho e Melo, and with the Queen Mother's approval, he appointed Carvalho e Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.

As the King's confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He [[Slavery in Portugal#Banning|abolished slavery]] in mainland Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended legal discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal by abolishing the distinction between [[Old Christian|Old]] and [[New Christian]]s.

Carvalho e Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He created one of the first [[appellation|appellation systems]] in the world by demarcating the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality; and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.

Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[Lisbon]] was struck by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 8.5–9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |title=Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date=12 November 1998 |access-date=6 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311082423/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html |archive-date=11 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carvalho e Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: "What now? We bury the dead and take care of the living."

Despite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by having troops march around the models. The buildings and large squares of the [[Lisbon Baixa|Pombaline Downtown]] still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Carvalho e Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing a detailed inquiry on the effects of the earthquake, the [[Parochial Memories of 1758]], that was sent to every parish in the country; this wealth of information allows modern scientists to reconstruct the event with some degree of scientific precision.

Following the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Carvalho de Melo became a powerful, [[Enlightened absolutism|progressive dictator]]. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the upper nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Marquis of Távora|Távora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and [[Távora affair|summarily executed after a quick trial]]. The following year, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed and expelled from the country]] and their assets confiscated by the crown. Carvalho e Melo spared none involved, even women and children (notably, 8-year-old [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal]], imprisoned in a convent for nineteen years). This was the final stroke that crushed all opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before the King's loyal minister. Joseph I ennobled Carvalho e Melo as Count of [[Oeiras, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.

In 1762, [[Spanish–Portuguese War, 1761–1763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.

Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Further titled "Marquês de Pombal" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1777.

The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquês de Pombal because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the Távora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquês de Pombal was banished to his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]], where he died in 1782.

However, historians also argue that Pombal's "enlightenment," while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91–108, 160–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the occupation by Napoleon, Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.

In the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].

In 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[João VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].

[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]
As a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that João VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.

Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.

Brazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.

Queen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853–1861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853–1856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante João, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Luís I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.

At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.

With the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|Sá da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Moçâmedes]], [[Lobito]], [[João Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Amélia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.

Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its "[[Pink Map]]", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].

The Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[São João Baptista de Ajudá]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].

On 1 February 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Luís Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Paço]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Luís da Costa]] and [[Manuel Buíça]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&amp;nbsp;twice – first on 14 June 1892, and then again on 10 May 1902&amp;nbsp;– causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].

=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===

{{Main|First Portuguese Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}
The new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914–1918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[First Portuguese Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').
This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.

Portugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].
From the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.

After India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organizations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.&lt;ref name =lele&gt;P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.
[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[António de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]
According to the census of 1921 São João Baptista de Ajudá had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.

Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]] in [[India]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

The [[Annexation of Goa|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.

Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974).

Throughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal Não É Um País Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |access-date=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archive-date=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===
{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}
[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa (disambiguation)|Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]
The Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. By the summer of 1975, the tension between these was so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. The forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further ''coup d'état'' on 25 November but the Group of Nine, a moderate military faction, immediately initiated a counter-coup. The main episode of this confrontation was the successful assault on the barracks of the left-wing dominated [[2nd Lancers Regiment (Portugal)|Military Police Regiment]] by the moderate forces of the Commando Regiment, resulting in three soldiers [[killed in action]]. The Group of Nine emerged victorious, thus preventing the establishment of a [[Communism|communist]] state in Portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090113204408/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Over one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[Mário Soares]] and [[António de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organizing the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.

Portugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salvação Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and Mário Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. Mário Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.
[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Mário Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]
After the transition to democracy, Portugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977–78 and 1983–85.

In 1986, Portugal, along with Spain, joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.

Portugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on 20 December 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]
On 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On 5 July 2004, [[José Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.

Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilize its finances.

The territory of Portugal includes an area on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]]. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian west|32°]] and [[6th meridian west|6° W]].

[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]] is split by its main river, the [[Tagus]], that flows from Spain and disgorges in the [[Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve|Tagus Estuary]], in Lisbon, before escaping into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, including the [[Algarve]] and the [[Alentejo]] regions, is characterized by rolling plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vieira|first1=Gonçalo|last2=Luís|first2=Zêzere José|last3=Mora|first3=Carla|title=Landscapes and Landforms of Portugal|date=2018|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-03640-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's highest peak is the similarly named [[Mount Pico]] on the island of [[Pico Island|Pico]] in the Azores. This ancient volcano, which measures {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is an iconic symbol of the Azores, while the [[Serra da Estrela]] on the mainland (the summit being {{convert|1991|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level) is an important seasonal attraction for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts.

The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean: the Azores straddling the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] on a tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by [[plate tectonics|in-plate]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] geology. Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events. The last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957–58 ([[Capelinhos]]) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically, usually of low intensity.

{{Main|Climate of Portugal}}
[[File:Portugal Köppen.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Köppen climate classification map of continental Portugal]]

Portugal is mainly characterized by a [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the South, central interior, and the [[Douro]] river valley; ''Csb'' in the North, Central west and [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park|Vicentine Coast)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Portugal.htm|title=Climate of the World: Portugal |website=Weatheronline.co.uk|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oceanic climate|temperate maritime climate]] (Cfb) in the mainland north-western highlands and mountains, and in some high altitude zones of the Azorean islands; a [[semi-arid climate]] in certain parts of the [[Beja District]] far south (''BSk'') and in [[Porto Santo Island]] (BSh), a [[BWh|warm desert climate]] (BWh) in the [[Savage Islands|Selvagens Islands]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]] in the western [[Azores]] (Cfa), according to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification]]. It is one of the warmest countries in Europe: the annual average temperature in [[mainland Portugal]] varies from {{convert|10-12|°C|°F|1}} in the mountainous interior north to {{convert|16-18|°C|°F|1}} in the south and on the [[Guadiana]] [[river basin]]. There are however, variations from the highlands to the lowlands: Spanish biologist Salvador Rivas Martinez presents several different bioclimatic zones for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/tb_med.htm|title=Mapas bioclimáticos y biogeográficos|website=Globalbioclimatics.org|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Algarve]], separated from the [[Alentejo]] region by mountains reaching up to {{convert|900|m|ft}} in [[Fóia (mountain)|Alto da Fóia]], has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia.

Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over {{convert|3200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} on the [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]] to less than {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in southern parts of [[Alentejo]]. [[Mount Pico]] is recognized as receiving the largest annual rainfall (over {{convert|6250|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year) in Portugal, according to ''[[Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera]]''.

In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual diurnal average temperatures can be as high as {{convert|26|°C|°F}}, and summer's highest temperatures are routinely over {{convert|40|°C|°F}}. The record high of {{convert|47.4|°C|°F}} was recorded in [[Amareleja]], although this might not be the hottest spot in summer, according to satellite readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extremos climáticos de temperatura, Capitais Distrito|url=http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/extremos.clima/|publisher=Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera|access-date=23 January 2013|author=Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera|language=pt|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/extremos.clima/|title=Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera, IP Portugal|publisher=ipma.pt |access-date=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowfalls occur regularly in the winter in the interior North and Centre of the country in districts such as [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Bragança District|Bragança]], [[Viseu District|Viseu]] and [[Vila Real District|Vila Real]], particularly on the mountains. In winter, temperatures may drop below {{convert|-10.0|°C|°F}}, particularly in [[Serra da Estrela]], [[Serra do Gerês]], [[Serra do Marão]] and [[Montesinho Natural Park|Serra de Montesinho]]. In these places snow can fall any time from October to May. In the South of the country snowfalls are rare but still occur in the highest elevations. While the official absolute minimum by [[Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera|IPMA]] is {{convert|-16.0|°C|°F}} in [[Penhas da Saúde]] and [[Miranda do Douro]], lower temperatures have been recorded, such as {{convert|-17.5|°C|°F}} by [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]] Polytechnic Institute in the outskirts of the city in 1983, and below {{convert|-20.0|°C|°F}} in Serra da Estrela.

Continental Portugal has around 2300 to 3200 hours of sunshine a year, an average of 4–6&amp;nbsp;h in winter and 10–12&amp;nbsp;h in the summer, with higher values in the south-east, south-west and the Algarve coast and lower in the north-west. Insolation values are lower in the archipelagos, with around 1600 h in the humid [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]] and around 2300 h in the island of Madeira and Porto Santo. Insolation in the [[Selvagens]] is thought to be higher due to weaker [[orographic lift]] and their relative proximity to the [[Sahara Desert]].

Portugal's central west and southwest coasts have an extreme ocean [[seasonal lag]], sea temperatures are warmer in October than in July and are their coldest in March.
The average [[sea surface temperature]] on the west coast of mainland Portugal varies from {{convert|14|-|16|°C|°F|1}} in January−March to {{convert|19|-|21|°C|°F|1}} in August−October while on the south coast it ranges from {{convert|16|°C|°F|1}} in January−March and rises in the summer to about {{convert|22|-|23|°C|°F|1}}, occasionally reaching {{convert|26|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enjoyable, Mediterranean Climate in Portugal|url=https://www.liveandinvestoverseas.com/country-hub/portugal/climate-in-portugal/|department=Ocean temperatures in Portugal|website=LiveandInvestOverseas.com|access-date=18 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Azores, around {{convert|16|°C|°F|1}} in February−April to {{convert|22|-|24|°C|°F|1}} in July−September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Average sea temperature of the Azores |url=https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/portugal/sao-roque-do-pico.htm |publisher=seatemperature.org |access-date=9 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Madeira, around {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}} in February−April to {{convert|23|-|24|°C|°F|1}} in August−October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Average sea temperature of Madeira |url=https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/portugal/funchal.htm |publisher=seatemperature.org |access-date=9 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate, although variations between islands exist, making weather predictions very difficult (owing to rough topography). The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range, with annual average temperatures exceeding {{convert|20|°C|°F}} in some parts of the coast (according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute). Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer. Consequently, the islands of the Azores have been identified as having a [[Mediterranean Climate]] (both ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' types), while some islands (such as [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] or [[Corvo Island|Corvo]]) are classified as [[Humid subtropical]] (''Cfa''), transitioning into an [[Oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') at higher altitudes, according to Köppen-Geiger classification.

[[Porto Santo Island]] in Madeira has a warm semi-arid climate (''BSh''). The [[Savage Islands]], which are part of the regional territory of Madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified as a desert climate (''BWh'') with an annual average rainfall of approximately {{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The sea surface temperature in these islands varies from {{convert|18.5|°C|°F|1}} in winter to {{convert|23|-|24|°C|°F|1}} in the summer occasionally reaching {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Biodiversity ===
[[File:Geres1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Peneda-Gerês National Park]] is the only nationally designated park in Portugal, owing to the rarity and significance of its environment.]]

Portugal is located on the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the third most diverse hotspot of flora in the world.&lt;ref name="florestas" /&gt; Due to its geographical and climatic context - between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic - Portugal has a high rate of biodiversity on land and at sea. It is home to six terrestrial ecoregions: [[Azores temperate mixed forests]], [[Cantabrian mixed forests]], [[Madeira evergreen forests]], [[Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests]], [[Northwest Iberian montane forests]], and [[Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests]].&lt;ref name="DinersteinOlson2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinerstein|first1=Eric|last2=Olson|first2=David|last3=Joshi|first3=Anup|last4=Vynne|first4=Carly|last5=Burgess|first5=Neil D.|last6=Wikramanayake|first6=Eric|last7=Hahn|first7=Nathan|last8=Palminteri|first8=Suzanne|last9=Hedao|first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed|last11=Hansen|first11=Matt|last12=Locke|first12=Harvey|last13=Ellis|first13=Erle C|last14=Jones|first14=Benjamin|last15=Barber|first15=Charles Victor|last16=Hayes|first16=Randy|last17=Kormos|first17=Cyril|last18=Martin|first18=Vance|last19=Crist|first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes|last21=Price|first21=Lori|last22=Baillie|first22=Jonathan E.

The President, who is elected to a five-year term, has an executive role: the current President is [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]]. The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of a maximum of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[António Costa]]) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The [[Courts]] are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.

Portugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national, regional and local levels. The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&amp;nbsp;– People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.

{{main|President of Portugal|List of presidents of Portugal}}
[[File:Lisbon, Belém Palace.JPG|thumb|right|[[Belém Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]

The Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]]. He or she has also supervision and [[reserve power]]s. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

The President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.

=== Government ===

{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}

[[File:Lisboa April 2014-15a.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Praça do Comércio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]

The Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.

The Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.

It has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited legislative powers. The Government can legislate about its own organization, about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of generalist laws issued by the Assembly.

The [[Council of Ministers (Portugal)|Council of Ministers]] – under the presidency of the Prime Minister (or the President of Portugal at the latter's request) and the Ministers (may also include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers) – acts as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office.

=== Parliament ===

{{main|Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|List of political parties in Portugal}}

The [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], in Lisbon, is the national [[parliament]] of Portugal. It is the main legislative body, although the Government also has limited legislative powers.

The Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.

Currently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats. The [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and [[CDS – People's Party|CDS-PP]] parties form the opposition to the government alongside [[People–Animals–Nature|PAN]], Chega, Iniciativa Liberal and Partido Livre.

A member state of the [[United Nations]] since 1955, Portugal is also a founding member of [[NATO]] (1949), [[OECD]] (1961) and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] (1960); it left the last in 1986 to join the [[European Economic Community]], which became the European Union in 1993.

In 1996, Portugal co-founded the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organization and political association of [[Lusophone]] nations across four continents, where [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is an official language. The global headquarters of the CPLP is in [[Penafiel Palace]], in [[Lisbon]].

[[António Guterres]], who has served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002 and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 2005 to 2015, assumed the post of [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] on 1 January 2017; making him the first Secretary-General from Western Europe since [[Kurt Waldheim]] of Austria (1972–1981), the first former head of government to become Secretary-General and the first Secretary-General born after the establishment of the United Nations on 26 June 1945.

In addition, Portugal is a full member of the [[Latin Union]] (1983) and the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] (1949). It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with its former colony, Brazil. Portugal and the [[United Kingdom]] share the world's oldest active military accord through their [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] ([[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]]), which was signed in 1373.

There are two international territorial disputes, both with Spain:
* [[Olivenza]]. Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]]. However, since the 19th century, it has been continuously ruled by Spain which considers the territory theirs not only ''de facto'' but also ''de jure''.&lt;ref name="One-europe.net_2017-09-29"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://one-europe.net/portugal-spain-the-territorial-disputes-of-olivenza-and-the-savage-islands| title=Portugal &amp; Spain – the territorial disputes of Olivenza and the Savage Islands (Part II) – OneEurope| newspaper=One-europe.net| date=11 February 2015| access-date=29 September 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929140112/http://one-europe.net/portugal-spain-the-territorial-disputes-of-olivenza-and-the-savage-islands| archive-date=29 September 2017| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Ilhas Selvagens ([[Savage Islands]]). The archipelago is under Portuguese domination but is geographically closer to the [[Canary Islands]] (165&amp;nbsp;km) than to [[Madeira]] (280&amp;nbsp;km). Found in 1364 by Italian navigators, the islands belonged to private owners until 1971, when the Portuguese government bought them and established a natural reserve area covering the whole archipelago. The islands have been claimed by Spain since 1911 and the dispute has caused some periods of political tension between the two countries. The main problem is not so much their intrinsic value but the fact that they expand the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of Portugal considerably to the south.&lt;ref name="Algarvedailynews.com_2017-09-29"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.algarvedailynews.com/features/environment/4361-new-maritime-area-in-dispute-between-portugal-and-spain| title=New maritime area in dispute between Portugal and Spain| newspaper=Algarvedailynews.com| access-date=29 September 2017| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929135147/http://www.algarvedailynews.com/features/environment/4361-new-maritime-area-in-dispute-between-portugal-and-spain| archive-date=29 September 2017| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Portuguese Armed Forces}}

The armed forces have three branches: [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], [[Portuguese Army|Army]] and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]. They serve primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and provide humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. {{As of|2008}}, the three branches numbered 39,200 active personnel including 7,500 women. [[List of countries by military expenditures|Portuguese military expenditure]] in 2009 was 5 billion US$,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Military expenditure (% of GDP) | website=Data | date=14 February 2002 | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS | language=id | access-date=11 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 2.1 per cent of GDP. Military conscription was abolished in 2004. The minimum age for voluntary recruitment is 18 years.

The Army (21,000 personnel) comprises three brigades and other small units. An [[Portuguese Intervention Brigade|infantry brigade]] (mainly equipped with [[Pandur II]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]), a [[Portuguese Mechanized Brigade|mechanized brigade]] (mainly equipped with [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2 A6]] tanks and [[M113]] APC) and a [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade|Rapid Reaction Brigade]] (consisting of [[Paratroopers' Regiment|paratroopers]], [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commandos]] and rangers). The Navy (10,700 personnel, of which 1,580 are [[Portuguese Marines|marines]]), the world's oldest surviving naval force, has five frigates, seven corvettes, two submarines, and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel) has the [[Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon]] as the main combat aircraft.

In addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]], a security force subject to military law and organization ([[gendarmerie]]) comprising 25,000 personnel. This force is under the authority of both the Defense and the Interior Ministry. It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor.

The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in the [[Lajes Air Base]] at [[Terceira Island]], in the Azores. The [[Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon]] (JFC Lisbon)&amp;nbsp;– one of the three main subdivisions of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Command Operations]]&amp;nbsp;– it is based in [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]], near Lisbon.

In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major conflicts: [[Portugal in the Great War|World War I]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974). After the end of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1975, the Portuguese Armed Forces have participated in peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq ([[Nasiriyah]]), Lebanon, [[Mali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/portuguese-soldier-killed-serving-in-mali/42332|title=Portuguese soldier killed serving in Mali|website=Theportugalnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/portuguese-troops-in-large-un-operation-in-central-african-republic/43458|title=Portuguese troops in 'large' UN operation in Central African Republic|website=Theportugalnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal also conducted several independent unilateral military operations abroad, as were the cases of the interventions of the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola in 1992 and in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 with the main objectives of protecting and withdrawing of Portuguese and foreign citizens threatened by local civil conflicts.

{{main|Judiciary of Portugal|Law of Portugal|Drug policy of Portugal|LGBT rights in Portugal}}
The Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).

The supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.

Portuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.

Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.

Portugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than "10 days worth of personal use" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

[[File:Render da Guarda no Palacio de Belem 22.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A cavalryman of the [[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]]'s honour guard]]
{{main|Law enforcement in Portugal}}
Portugal's main police organizations are the ''[[Guarda Nacional Republicana]]&amp;nbsp;– GNR'' ([[National Republican Guard (Portugal)|National Republican Guard]]), a [[gendarmerie]]; the ''[[Polícia de Segurança Pública]]&amp;nbsp;– PSP'' (Public Security Police), a civilian police force who work in urban areas; and the ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]&amp;nbsp;– PJ'' (Judicial Police), a highly specialized criminal investigation police that is overseen by the [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]].

=== Correctional services ===
Portugal has 49 correctional facilities in total run by the Ministry of Justice. They include 17 central prisons, 4 special prisons, 27 regional prisons, and 1 'Cadeia de Apoio'(Support Detention Centre).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prisonstudies.org/country/portugal|title=Portugal {{!}} World Prison Brief|website=prisonstudies.org|access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2021|January|1}}, their current prison population is about 11,234 inmates, which comes to about 0.11% of their entire population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Portugal : les prisons en 2021|url=https://www.prison-insider.com/fichepays/portugal-2021|access-date=20 April 2021|website=Prison Insider|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their incarceration rate has been on the rise since 2010, with a 15% increase over the past eight years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Portugal}}
Administratively, Portugal is divided into 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] ({{lang-pt|municípios or [[concelhos]]}}), which after a reform in [[2013 Portuguese local election|2013]] are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes ({{lang-pt|[[freguesia]]}}). Operationally, the municipality and civil parish, along with the national government, are the only legally [[local administrative unit]]s identified by the government of Portugal (for example, cities, towns or villages have no standing in law, although may be used as catchment for the defining services). For statistical purposes the Portuguese government also identifies [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS), inter-municipal communities and informally, the district system, used until European integration (and being phased-out by the national government).{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} Continental Portugal is agglomerated into 18 districts, while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as [[autonomous area|autonomous regions]]; the largest units, established since 1976, are either [[mainland Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Portugal Continental}}) and the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]).

The 18 districts of mainland Portugal are: [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Beja District|Beja]], [[Braga District|Braga]], [[Bragança District|Bragança]], [[Castelo Branco District|Castelo Branco]], [[Coimbra District|Coimbra]], [[Évora District|Évora]], [[Faro District|Faro]], [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Leiria District|Leiria]], [[Lisbon District|Lisbon]], [[Portalegre District|Portalegre]], [[Porto District|Porto]], [[Santarém District|Santarém]], [[Setúbal District|Setúbal]], [[Viana do Castelo District|Viana do Castelo]], [[Vila Real District|Vila Real]] and [[Viseu District|Viseu]]&amp;nbsp;– each district takes the name of the district capital.

Within the European Union NUTS system, Portugal is divided into seven regions: the [[Azores]], [[Alentejo]], [[Algarve]], [[Centro, Portugal|Centro]], [[Lisboa Region|Lisboa]], [[Madeira]] and [[Norte, Portugal|Norte]], and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira, NUTS areas are subdivided into 28 subregions.

[[File:Portuguese debt and EU average.png|thumb|left|alt=Portuguese debt compared to Eurozone average|Debt as a percentage of the [[economy of Portugal]], compared to eurozone average]]

The Portuguese government is heavily indebted, and received a 78-billion-euro bailout from the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 2011.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/business/global/portugals-debt-efforts-may-be-a-warning-for-greece.html|title=Portugal's Debt Efforts May Be a Warning for Greece|first=Landon Thomas|last=Jr|date=14 February 2012|access-date=2 August 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of Portugal's debt to its overall economy, was 107 per cent when it received the bailout.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; As part of the deal, the country agreed to cut its budget deficit from 9.8 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 per cent in 2011, 4.5 per cent in 2012 and 3 per cent in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/portugal-deficit-idUKL6E7ND4O320111213|title=Portugal 2011 deficit to beat goal on one-off revs-PM|work=Reuters UK|date=13 December 2011|access-date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bailout was announced, the Portuguese government headed by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] managed to implement measures with the intention of improving the state's financial situation, including tax hikes, a freeze of civil service-related lower-wages and cuts of higher-wages by 14.3%, on top of the government's spending cuts. The Portuguese government also agreed to eliminate its [[golden share]] in [[Portugal Telecom]] which gave it veto power over vital decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kowsmann, Patricia, [http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=466059 "Portugal govt ends golden-share holdings" (Paid content)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031181155/http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=466059 |date=31 October 2013 }}, Dow Jones Newswires 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/portugal-goldenshares/update-1-portugal-scraps-golden-shares-in-utilities-idUKLDE76414L20110705|title=UPDATE 1-Portugal scraps golden shares in utilities|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, all public servants had already seen an average wage cut of 20% relative to their 2010 baseline, with cuts reaching 25% for those earning more than 1,500 euro per month.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Management Technology Nagpur: [http://okonomos.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/3/6/4836267/okonomist.pdf "Eurocrisis"], Okonomist, Vol.1, Issue 3, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMF, the [[European Commission]] (EC) and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) said in September 2012 that Portugal's debt would peak at 124 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014.&lt;ref name="October 2012 status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_03/10/2012_464362|title=Portugal seeks market access with $5 bln bond exchange|publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition)|date=3 October 2012|access-date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF previously said in July 2012 that Portugal's debt would peak at about 118.5 per cent of GDP in 2013.&lt;ref name="October 2012 status"/&gt; In September 2013, the Portuguese Government reviewed again the public debt of Portugal for 2013 to 127.8 per cent, after a peak of 130.9 per cent in that month.&lt;ref name="September 2013 status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.pt/economia/noticia/divida-publica-revista-em-alta-para-1278-do-pib-em-2013-1607574|title=Dívida pública revista em alta para 127,8% do PIB em 2013 (Valor supera previsões iniciais do Governo, da troika e do FMI.)|publisher=Lusa and Público|date=30 September 2013|access-date=30 October 2013|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]] and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages.

Two Portuguese banks, [[Banco Português de Negócios]] (BPN) and [[Banco Privado Português]] (BPP), had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications – Portugal's then President, Cavaco Silva and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://expresso.sapo.pt/bpn-oliveira-costa-vendeu-a-cavaco-e-filha-250-mil-acoes-da-sln=f643506 BPN Oliveira Costa vendeu a Cavaco e filha 250 mil ações da SLN – Expresso.pt].

In the second decade of the 21st century, the Portuguese economy suffered its most severe recession since the 1970s, resulting in the country having to be bailed out by the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The bailout, agreed to in 2011, required [[Portugal and the IMF|Portugal]] to enter into a range of austerity measures in exchange for funding support of €78,000,000,000. In May 2014, the country exited the bailout but reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its reformist momentum. At the time of exiting the bailout, the economy had contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2014; however, unemployment, while still high, had fallen to 15.3%.&lt;ref name="PortugalBailoutEnds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Portugal follows Ireland out of bailout programme|url=http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/222083311/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Portugal-follows-Ireland-out-of-bailout-programme|access-date=18 May 2014|work=Europe Sun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518101759/http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/222083311/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Portugal-follows-Ireland-out-of-bailout-programme|archive-date=18 May 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Competitiveness Report]] for 2019, published by the [[World Economic Forum]], placed Portugal on the 34th position on the economic index.

The [[International Monetary Fund]] issued an update report on the economy of Portugal in late-June 2017 with a strong near-term outlook and an increase in investments and exports over previous years. Because of a surplus in 2016, the country was no longer bound by the Excessive Deficit Procedure which had been implemented during an earlier financial crisis. The banking system was more stable, although there were still non-performing loans and corporate debt. The IMF recommended working on solving these problems for Portugal to be able to attract more private investment. "Sustained strong growth, together with continued public debt reduction, would reduce vulnerabilities arising from high indebtedness, particularly when monetary accommodation is reduced."
The [[OECD]] economic reports since 2018 show recovery, albeit slow; and Portugal's growth prospects continue positive for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/06/29/mcs6292017-portugal-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2017-article-iv-mission|title=Portugal: Staff Concluding Statement of the 2017 Article IV Mission|website=Imf.org|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-portugal_en_0.pdf |title=Country Report Portugal 2019 Including an In-Depth Review on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances|date= 2019|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=11 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/economy/portugal-economic-snapshot/|title=Portugal Economic Snapshot - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campilhas March 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The [[Alentejo]] is known as the "bread basket of Portugal", being the country's leading region in wheat and cork production.]]

[[Agriculture in Portugal]] is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. However, the sector also includes larger scale [[intensive farming]] export-oriented [[agrobusiness]]es backed by companies (like [[Grupo RAR]]'s [[Vitacress]], [[Sovena]], [[Lactogal]], [[Vale da Rosa]], [[Companhia das Lezírias]] and [[Valouro]]). The country produces a wide variety of crops and livestock products, including: [[tomato]]es, [[citrus]], [[green vegetables]], [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[maize]], [[olive]]s, [[oilseed]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Cherry|cherries]], [[bilberry]], [[table grapes]], [[edible mushroom]]s, [[dairy products]], [[poultry]] and [[beef]]. According to [[FAO]], Portugal is the top producer of [[Cork (material)|cork]] and [[carob]] in the world, accounting to about 50% and 30% of world production respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC |title=Crop production |publisher=FAO |access-date=21 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the third largest exporter of [[chestnut]] and the third largest European producer of [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]].&lt;ref&gt;De Portugal para o mundo: produtos florestais líderes de mercado, Florestas.pt https://florestas.pt/valorizar/de-portugal-para-o-mundo-produtos-florestais-lideres-de-mercado/&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal is among the top ten largest [[olive oil]] producers in the world and is the fourth biggest exporter.&lt;ref&gt;An ancestral relationship, Azeite do Alentejo https://azeitedoalentejo.pt/en/o-azeite-do-alentejo/&lt;/ref&gt; The country is also one of the world's largest exporters of [[wine]], being reputed for its [[fine wine]]s.

[[Forestry]] has also played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry (namely [[paper industry]] that includes [[Portucel Soporcel Group]], [[engineered wood]] that includes [[Sonae Indústria]], and [[furniture]] that includes several manufacturing plants in and around [[Paços de Ferreira]], the core of Portugal's major industrial operations of [[IKEA]]). In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of the national GDP.

Portuguese-processed fish products are exported through several companies, under a number of different brands and registered trademarks, such as [[Conservas Ramirez|Ramirez]], the world's oldest active canned fish producer.

Portugal is a significant European [[minerals]] producer and is ranked among Europe's leading [[copper]] producers. The nation is also a notable producer of [[tin]], [[tungsten]] and [[uranium]]. However, the country lacks the potential to conduct [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and [[aluminium]], a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal's [[Mining in Portugal|mining]] and [[metallurgy]] sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves – mainly in the north – after the 1974 revolution and the consequent [[economic globalization]], low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The [[Panasqueira]] and [[Neves-Corvo mine]]s are among the most recognized Portuguese mines that are still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://visao.sapo.pt/actualidade/economia/2017-09-12-Guia-para-perceber-o-negocio-das-minas-em-Portugal|title=Guia para perceber o negócio das minas em Portugal|website=Visao.sapo.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal is rich in its [[lithium]] subsoil, which is especially concentrated in the districts of [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Viseu]], [[Vila Real]] and [[Viana do Castelo]], while most of the country's lithium comes from the Gonçalo aplite-pegmatite field.

Lithium prices have risen in expectation of growing demand for the mineral, which is used in batteries for electric vehicles and for storing electricity from the power grid. Europe consumes more than 20 per cent of the global supply of battery-grade lithium but currently has to import all its supplies of the mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Savannah raises Portugal lithium estimate by more than 50% (subscription required)|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b58c9286-4df4-11e8-97e4-13afc22d86d4|access-date=20 April 2021|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Science and technology in Portugal}}
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of [[R&amp;D]] units belonging to [[list of universities in Portugal|public universities]] and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the [[Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação|INETI&amp;nbsp;– Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação]] and the [[Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos|INRB&amp;nbsp;– Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos]]. The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education]] (MCTES) and the MCTES's [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia]] (FCT).

The largest R&amp;D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications, include [[biosciences]] research institutions like the [[Instituto de Medicina Molecular]], the [[Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]], the [[IPATIMUP]], the [[Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular]] and the [[Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute]].

Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the [[Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência]] and the [[Champalimaud Foundation]], a neuroscience and oncology research centre which awards every year one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world. A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also responsible for research and development projects. One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]], founded in 1779.

[[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] bilateral state-supported research efforts include the [[International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory]] and the [[Ibercivis]] [[distributed computing]] platform, which are joint research programmes of both Portugal and Spain. Portugal is a member of several pan-European scientific organizations. These include the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[European Laboratory for Particle Physics]] (CERN), [[ITER]], and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO).

Portugal has the largest [[aquarium]] in Europe, the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], and the Portuguese have several other notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency ''Ciência Viva'', a programme of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology to the promotion of a scientific and technological culture among the Portuguese population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ciência Viva|url=http://www.cienciaviva.pt/cienciaviva/index.asp?accao=changelang&amp;lang=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101927/https://www.cienciaviva.pt/cienciaviva/index.asp?accao=changelang&amp;lang=en|archive-date=29 April 2011|access-date=22 August 2010|publisher=Cienciaviva.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Science Museum of the University of Coimbra]], the [[List of natural history museums#Portugal|National Museum of Natural History]] at the University of Lisbon, and the [[Visionarium (Portugal)|Visionarium]].

By the early-1970s, Portugal's [[Economic history of Portugal|fast economic growth]] with increasing [[mass consumption|consumption]] and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in transportation. Again in the 1990s, after joining the [[European Economic Community]], the country built many new motorways. Today, the country has a {{convert|68732|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} road network, of which almost {{convert|3000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are part of system of 44 motorways. Opened in 1944, the first motorway (which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium) was an innovative project that made Portugal one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway (this roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway, or A5).

Although a few other tracts were created (around 1960 and 1970), it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale motorway construction was implemented. In 1972, [[BRISA Auto-estradas de Portugal S.A.|Brisa]], the highway concessionaire, was founded to handle the management of many of the region's motorways. On many highways, a toll needs to be paid (see [[Via Verde]]). [[Vasco da Gama bridge]] is the longest bridge in Europe at 12.345&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/7961/Travel++Places/Top+10+Longest+Bridges+in+the+World.aspx|title=ListAfterList.com|publisher=ListAfterList.com|access-date=22 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502013507/http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/7961/Travel++Places/Top+10+Longest+Bridges+in+the+World.aspx|archive-date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curiousread.com/2008/02/ten-longest-bridges-in-world.html |title=Curious?

[[Continental Portugal]]'s {{convert|89015|km2|0|abbr=on}} territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]]. Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country. The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Air Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]], though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures. Currently, the most important airports are in [[Portela Airport|Lisbon]], [[Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport|Porto]], [[Faro Airport|Faro]], [[Madeira Airport|Funchal]] (Madeira), and [[João Paulo II Airport|Ponta Delgada]] (Azores), managed by the national airport authority group [[ANA&amp;nbsp;– Aeroportos de Portugal]]. One other important airport is the Aeroporto Internacional das Lajes on the island of Terceira in the Azores. This airport serves as one of two international airports serving countries outside the European Union for all nine islands of the Azores. It also serves as a military air base for the United States Air Force. The base remains in use to the present day.

A national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain, is supported and administered by [[Comboios de Portugal]] (CP). [[Rail transport]] of passengers and goods is derived using the {{convert|2791|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of railway lines currently in service, of which {{convert|1430|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are electrified and about {{convert|900|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} allow train speeds greater than {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The railway network is managed by [[Infraestruturas de Portugal]] while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of CP, both public companies. In 2006, the CP carried 133,000,000 passengers and {{convert|9750000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of goods.

The major seaports are located in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]], [[Lisbon]], [[Leixões]], [[Setúbal]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Figueira da Foz]], and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].

The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: [[Lisbon Metro]] and ''Metro Sul do Tejo'' in the [[Lisbon metropolitan area]] and [[Porto Metro]] in the [[Porto Metropolitan Area]], each with more than {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of lines. In Portugal, [[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon tram services]] have been supplied by the ''Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa'' ([[Carris]]), for over a century. In [[Porto]], [[Trams in Porto|a tram network]], of which only a tourist line on the shores of the [[Douro]] remains, began construction on 12 September 1895 (a first for the [[Iberian Peninsula]]). All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.

{{Main|Energy in Portugal}}
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power, the two most cost-effective renewable energy sources. Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuels. In 2006, the world's largest [[solar energy|solar power]] plant at that date, the [[Moura Photovoltaic Power Station]], began operating near [[Moura, Portugal|Moura]], in the south, while the world's first commercial [[wave power]] farm, the [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]], opened in the [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]] (2008). By the end of 2006, 66% of the country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while 29% were derived from [[hydroelectric]] dams, and 6% by [[wind energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=PT |title=IEA Energy Statistics: Portugal |access-date=7 April 2009 |publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] |year=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812142811/http://www.iea.org/Textbase/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=PT |archive-date=12 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, renewable energy resources were producing 43% of the nation's consumption of electricity, even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=114&amp;id_news=381941 |title=Fontes renováveis originaram 43% da electricidade consumida |work=Diário Digital |author=Staff |date=8 April 2009 |language=pt |access-date=17 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514163035/http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=114&amp;id_news=381941 |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, electricity exports had outnumbered imports. In the period between January and May 2010, 70% of the national production of energy came from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.agenciafinanceira.iol.pt/empresas/portugal-agencia-financeira-ren-energia-electricidade/1168567-1728.html |title=Portugal já exportou mais electricidade este ano que em 2009 |work=Agência Financeira |date=8 June 2010 |language=pt |access-date=8 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619070535/http://www.agenciafinanceira.iol.pt/empresas/portugal-agencia-financeira-ren-energia-electricidade/1168567-1728.html |archive-date=19 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's national energy transmission company, [[Redes Energéticas Nacionais]] (REN), uses sophisticated modelling to predict weather, especially wind patterns, and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plants.
Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades. New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.

The Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE – [[Instituto Nacional de Estatística (Portugal)|Instituto Nacional de Estatística]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male).  In 2020 and according to more up-to-date figures, the population decreased to 10,298,252, although it was an increase compared with 2019.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiner|first=Rebecca|title=Portugal Virtual Jewish History Tour|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html|access-date=6 May 2012|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948–956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics (Iron Age Period)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|website=Eupedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] genetical markers. Also expectable but not so common are South European (Sardinian, Italian and Balkans), broadly North-western (West Germanic) and to a lesser extent British/Irish (Brythonic/Gaelic) and French (Alpine).

Native Portuguese are an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] ethnic group and they form 95% of the whole population, whose ancestry is very similar to [[Spaniards]] and have strong ties with fellow [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic Arc countries]] like Ireland, British Isles, France and Belgium due to maritime trade dated as far back as the Bronze Age. These maritime contacts and the prevalence of R1b haplogroup as the main genetical marker of these countries suggest a common ancestry and cultural proximity. Other maritime contacts with the Mediterranean especially with Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans and Moors added some particular phenotypes in southern Portugal and particularly southern Spain (the [[Tartessos]] culture), making Portugal and north-western Spain a bridge between north-western Europe and the Mediterranean but maintaining the [[Atlantic]] character.

Despite the good economic development in the past three decades the Portuguese were the shortest in Europe since 1890. This emerging height gap took place in the 1840s and has increased since. One of the driving factors was the modest real wage development, given the late industrialization and economic growth in Portugal compared to the European core. Another determinant was the delayed [[human capital]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stolz | first1=Yvonne | last2=Baten | first2=Jörg | last3=Reis | first3=Jaime | year=2013 | title=Portuguese living standards, 1720–1980, in European comparison: heights, income, and human capital| journal=Economic History Review | volume=66 | issue=2 | pages=545–578 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00658.x| hdl=10451/20518 | s2cid=73565474 | hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansionary 2019 budget, backed by a [[left-wing]] majority in parliament, also aims to boost the purchasing power of households while cutting the already low deficit even further. [[Circular migration|Returning emigrants]] will be allowed to declare only half their taxable income for five years if they return, provided they lived abroad for at least three years. The "Return Programme" is to run for two years. Around 500,000 residents left Portugal between 2010 and 2015 after the [[Great Recession]]. Although some 350,000 have since returned, Lisbon wants to tempt the rest to come home – in a similar scheme to the Irish one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dfa.ie/global-irish/returning-to-ireland/|title=Returning to Ireland – Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|website=Dfa.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal has approved a credit line for Portuguese emigrants aiming to invest in the country on their return. Furthermore, Emigrants returning in 2019 and 2020 will see their taxes halved as part of the stimulus to bring native Portuguese back and revitalize the population and promote continued economic growth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theportugalnews.com/news/government-creates-credit-line-for-emigrants-returning-to-invest/48771|title=Government creates credit line for emigrants returning to invest|website=Theportugalnews.com|access-date=2 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as Portugal struggles with a low birth rate and an [[ageing population]]. According to projections by the national statistics office, Portugal's population will fall to 7.7 million by 2080 from 10.3 million now and the population will continue to age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://punchng.com/portugal-offers-tax-breaks-to-returning-emigrants/|title=Portugal offers tax breaks to returning emigrants|website=Punchng.com|date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's [[Portuguese Empire|colonial history]] has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] and [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]] in 1975), turning over the administration of [[Macau]] to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Brazilians]] have Portuguese ancestry),&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal&amp;nbsp;– Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. Portugal: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; has now become a country of net immigration,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4436276.stm Portugal sees integration progress]", BBC News, 14 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and not just from the last [[Portuguese India|Indian]] (Portuguese until 1961), [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|African]] (Portuguese until 1975), and [[Macau|Far East Asian]] (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt;

Since the 1990s, along with a boom in [[construction]], several new waves of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Brazilians|Brazilian]], [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Lusophone Africans]] and other [[Africans]] have settled in the country. [[Romanian people|Romanians]], [[Moldovans]], [[Kosovo Albanians]], [[Russian people|Russians]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] have also migrated to the country. Portugal's [[Romani people|Romani]] population is estimated to be at about 40,000.

Numbers of [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]], [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] migrants are also significant. It is estimated that over 30,000 seasonal, often [[illegal immigrants]] work in [[agriculture]], mainly in the south where they are often exploited by organised seasonal-worker's networks. The workers sometimes get paid less than half the minimum pay established by law. These migrants who often arrive without due documentation or work-contracts, make up over 90% of agricultural workers in the south of Portugal.
Most are Indo-Asians, from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], Pakistan and [[Thailand]]. In the interior of the [[Alentejo]] there are many African workers. Significant numbers also come from Eastern Europe, Moldova, Ukraine, Romania and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=LP|date=2020-05-01|title=Trabalhadores agrícolas imigrantes: Precários e explorados|url=https://jornaldoalgarve.pt/trabalhadores-agricolas-imigrantes-precarios-e-explorados/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Jornal do Algarve|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a number of [[EU citizen]]s, mostly from the United Kingdom or other northern European countries, have become permanent residents in the country (with the British community being mostly composed of retired pensioners who live in the Algarve and Madeira).&lt;ref&gt;[http://embaixada-portugal-brasil.blogspot.com/2007/06/brasileiros-so-maior-colnia-estrangeira.html Brasileiros são a maior colónia estrangeira em Portugal] Embaixada de Portugal No Brasil {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106043956/http://embaixada-portugal-brasil.blogspot.com/2007/06/brasileiros-so-maior-colnia-estrangeira.html |date=6 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 Census, 81.0% of the Portuguese population was [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf Censo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |date=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has small Protestant, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]], [[Islam in Portugal|Muslim]], [[Hinduism in Portugal|Hindu]], [[Sikh]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Spiritism|Spiritist]] communities. Influences from [[African Traditional Religion]] and Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among many people, particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional African Herbal Medicine. Some 6.8% of the population declared themselves to be non-religious, and 8.3% did not give any answer about their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censos.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=CENSOS&amp;xpgid=ine_censos_indicador&amp;contexto=ind&amp;indOcorrCod=0006396&amp;selTab=tab10 |title=Instituto Nacional de Estatistica, Censos 2011 |publisher=Censos.ine.pt |access-date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation. Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed power and close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including its [[University of Coimbra|first university]].

The growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[colonization]], with important roles in the [[Teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910–26) changed the role and importance of organized religion.

Portugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the First Portuguese Republic, and this was reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]]. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to [[religious freedom]] in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the [[Holy See]] and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.

Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. It is a [[Romance language]] that is derived from [[Galician-Portuguese]], which was spoken in what is now [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]]. There are still strong similarities between the [[Galicians|Galician]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] cultures. Galicia is a consultative observer of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].

The Portuguese language is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] spoken by the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] around 2000 years ago – particularly the [[Celts]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Conii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guerra |first1=Amílcar |title=Algumas observações sobre a Escrita do Sudoeste |journal=Xelb |date=2010 |volume=10 |pages=103–113 |hdl=10451/9756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lusitanians]]&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; and [[Turduli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXJQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=turdulos+origem+academia&amp;pg=RA1-PA117 | title=Historia e memorias da Academia R.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugueselanguage.net/portuguese/history.asp|title=History of the Portuguese|website=Portugueselanguage.net|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Portuguese is spoken as a native language in five different continents, with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country.
In 2013 the Portuguese language is the official language spoken in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and [[East Timor]]. These countries, plus [[Macau]] Special Administrative Region (People's Republic of China) where Portuguese is co-official with [[Cantonese]], make up the [[Lusosphere]], a term derived from the ancient [[Roman province]] of "[[Lusitania]]", which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the [[Douro]] river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:id=lusitania-geo|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), Labanae Aquae´NIA|website=Tufts.edu|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal. It is part of the [[Astur-Leonese]] group of languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://termcoord.eu/2015/05/discovering-mirandese/|title=Discovering Mirandese|date=26 May 2015|website=Terminology Coordination Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate of between 6,000 and 7,000 Mirandese speakers has been documented for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://languagesindanger.eu/book-of-knowledge/list-of-languages/|title=List of Languages|website=Languagesindanger.eu|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[EF English Proficiency Index|International English Proficiency Index]], Portugal has a high proficiency level in [[English language|English]], higher than those of other Romance-speaking European countries like Italy, France or Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/|title=EF English Proficiency Index – A comprehensive ranking of countries by English skills|website=Ef.co.uk|access-date=2 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802000431/http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, compulsory), secondary education (3 years, compulsory since 2010), and higher education (subdivided in university and [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] education). Universities are usually organized into [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|Portuguese higher education institutions]].

The total adult literacy rate is 99.4 per cent. Portuguese primary school enrolments are 100 per cent.

According to the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) 2015, the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed significantly above the [[OECD]]'s average, at a similar level as those students from Norway, Denmark and Belgium, with 501 points (493 is the average). The PISA results of the Portuguese students have been continuously improving, overcoming a number of other highly developed Western countries like the US, Austria, France and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url = https://visao.sapo.pt/actualidade/sociedade/2016-12-06-Testes-PISA-Portugal-supera-media-da-OCDE|title = Testes PISA: Portugal supera média da OCDE|magazine=[[Visão]]|language = pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://expresso.sapo.pt/sociedade/2016-12-06-E-agora-no-PISA-alunos-portugueses-melhoram-a-ciencias-leitura-e-matematica

In addition to being a destination for [[international student]]s, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totalled 380,937 in 2005.
[[File:University of Evora (36815429156).jpg|thumb|252x252px|[[University of Évora|University of Evora]], Portugal's second oldest university.]]
Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra|title=University of Coimbra|date=16 July 2015|website=Top Universities}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de Goa|Escola Médico-Cirúrgica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].

The [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.

Most student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).

Portugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.

According to the [[Human Development Report]], the average [[life expectancy]] in Portugal had reached 82 years in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://countryeconomy.com/demography/life-expectancy/portugal|title=Portugal - Life expectancy at birth 2017|website=countryeconomy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2020 it is estimated at 82.11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zonzeewerk.nl/blog/portugal-in-numbers|title=Portugal in numbers|website=zonzeewerk.nl|access-date=8 April 2020|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613115155/https://zonzeewerk.nl/blog/portugal-in-numbers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As projected by the United Nations, the life expectancy of the Portuguese population will be over 90 years when we reach 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zonzeewerk.nl/blog/portugal-in-numbers|title=Demographics of Portugal|website=zonzeewerk.nl|access-date=9 April 2020|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613115155/https://zonzeewerk.nl/blog/portugal-in-numbers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trajectory of the Portuguese life expectancy is visualized with historical data from 1950 and future projections up to 2100, as can be seen in the graph on the left.

Portugal ranks 12th in the best public health systems in the world, ahead of other countries like the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] or [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://countryeconomy.com/demography/life-expectancy/portugal|title=Portugal – Life expectancy at birth 2015|website=Countryeconomy.com|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service (''Serviço Nacional de Saúde'', SNS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health subsystems) and voluntary private health insurance. The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.

The SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.

Similar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.

Portugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.

People are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.

Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |access-date=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2009 }}.

Portuguese literature, one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text as well as song. Until 1350, the [[Portuguese-Galician]] [[troubadour]]s spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;''Poesia e Prosa Medievais'', p. 9, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gil Vicente]] (c. 1465–c. 1536) was one of the founders of Portuguese dramatic traditions.

Adventurer and poet [[Luís de Camões]] (c. 1524–1580) wrote the epic poem ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (''The Lusiads''), with [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' as his main influence.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800–1882 |access-date = 31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage|Bocage]] (1765–1805), [[Antero de Quental]] (1842–1891) and [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888–1935). Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as [[Almeida Garrett]], [[Camilo Castelo Branco]], [[José Maria de Eça de Queirós|Eça de Queirós]], [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]], [[António Lobo Antunes]] and [[Miguel Torga]]. Particularly popular and distinguished is [[José Saramago]], recipient of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

Portuguese cuisine is very diverse. The Portuguese consume a lot of dry [[cod]] (''[[bacalhau]]'' in Portuguese), for which there are hundreds of [[Bacalhau#Bacalhau dishes|recipes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=António José |last1=Marques da Silva |year=2015 |chapter=The fable of the cod and the promised sea.

Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido à portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leitão'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco à alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice. [[Peri-peri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.
[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in Lisbon]]
Typical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, "Tripas à moda do Porto" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[pastéis de Belém]] (or ''pastéis de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.

Portuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do Dão]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Setúbal]] and [[Favaios]]. Port and Madeira are particularly appreciated in a wide range of places around the world.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Portugal}}
[[File:Jose malhoa fado.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fado]], depicted in this famous painting (c. 1910) by [[José Malhoa]], is Portugal's traditional music.]]

Portugal has a [[List of Portuguese artists|rich history in painting]]. The first well-known painters date back to the 15th century&amp;nbsp;– like [[Nuno Gonçalves]] and [[Grão Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]]&amp;nbsp;– were part of the late Gothic painting period. During the renaissance Portuguese painting was highly influenced by north European painting. In the Baroque period [[Josefa de Óbidos]] and [[Vieira Lusitano]] were the most prolific painters.
[[José Malhoa]], known for his work ''Fado'', and [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] (who painted the portraits of [[Teófilo Braga]] and [[Antero de Quental]]) were both references in [[Naturalist school of painting|naturalist painting]].

The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Modernism]], and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: [[Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso]], who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly the Delaunays ([[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay|Sonia]]). Among his best-known works is ''Canção Popular a Russa e o Fígaro''. Another great modernist painters/writers were [[Carlos Botelho]] and [[Almada Negreiros]], friend to the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who painted Pessoa's portrait.
