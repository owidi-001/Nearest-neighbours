With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the [[List of European Union member states by population|third-most populous member state of the European Union]].

Due to its central geographic location in [[Southern Europe]] and [[Mediterranean Basin|the Mediterranean]], Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures.

An Italic tribe known as the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] formed the [[Roman Kingdom]] in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a [[Roman Republic|republic]] with a government of the [[SPQR|Senate and the People]]. The [[Roman Republic]] initially [[Roman expansion in Italy|conquered]] and [[Romanization (cultural)|assimilated]] its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually [[Roman republic|expanding and conquering]] parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]. By the first century BC, the [[Roman Empire]] emerged as the dominant power in the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and became a [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|leading cultural, political and religious]] [[Caput Mundi|centre]], inaugurating the [[Pax Romana]], a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's [[Roman law|law]], [[Roman technology|technology]], [[Roman economy|economy]], [[Roman art|art]], and [[Latin literature|literature]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/hannibalswarmili00laze|url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/hannibalswarmili00laze/page/29 29] |quote=Italy homeland of the Romans. |title=Hannibal's War: A Military History of the Second Punic War |first=John Francis |last=Lazenby |date=4 February 1998 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |via=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-8061-3004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItsTDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=italy+metropole+roman+empire&amp;pg=PA45 |title=Contours of the World Economy 1-2030 AD: Essays in Macro-Economic History |first=Angus |last=Maddison |date=20 September 2007 |publisher=OUP Oxford |via=Google Books |isbn=978-0-19-922721-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], Italy endured the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], but by the 11th century numerous rival [[Italian city-states|city-states]] and [[maritime republics]], mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through trade, commerce and banking, laying the groundwork for modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sée |first=Henri |title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution |url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf |work=University of Rennes |publisher=Batoche Books |access-date=29 August 2013|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of [[democracy]] than the larger [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy was under the control of the [[Theocracy|theocratic]] [[Papal States]], while [[Southern Italy]] remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Arab]], [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman]], [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] and other foreign conquests of the region.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jepson |first1=Tim |title=National Geographic Traveler: Italy |date=2012 |publisher=National Geographic Books |url={{Google books|f2jihJ0bq4EC |page=PA28 |keywords=trade%20routes%20italy%20new world |text= |plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-1-4262-0861-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Renaissance]] began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]], [[Age of Discovery|exploration]] and [[Renaissance art|art]]. Italian culture flourished, producing famous scholars, artists and [[polymath]]s. During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the [[Far East]] and the [[New World]], helping to usher in the European [[Age of Discovery]].

Hypotheses for the etymology of the name "Italia" are numerous.&lt;ref name= Manco&gt;Alberto Manco, ''Italia. Disegno storico-linguistico'', 2009, [[Napoli]], L'Orientale, {{ISBN|978-88-95044-62-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is that it was borrowed via [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] from the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''Víteliú'' 'land of calves' (''cf.'' [[Latin|Lat]] ''vitulus'' "calf", [[Umbrian language|Umb]] ''vitlo'' "calf")&lt;!-- and named for the god of cattle, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after [[Italus]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
''Roman Antiquities'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html 1.35], on LacusCurtius&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned also by [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b#note-link2 7.1329b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910185719/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b |date=10 September 2015 }}, on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 6.2.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924213434/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |date=24 September 2015 }}, on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the term Italy was used by the Greeks to initially refer only to the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern province of [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] and part of the provinces of [[Catanzaro]] and [[Vibo Valentia]] in [[southern Italy]]. Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of [[Oenotria]] and "Italy" had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', before the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the [[strait of Messina]] and the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]], corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]]. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name "Italia" to a larger region&lt;ref&gt;Pallottino, M., ''History of Earliest Italy'', trans. Ryle, M &amp; Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Seventeenth Series, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the "Greek Italy" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an "Etruscan Italy" covering variable areas of central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Brizzi, Roma. Potere e identità: dalle origini alla nascita dell'impero cristiano, Bologna, Patron, 2012 p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The borders of Roman Italy, ''Italia'', are better established. Cato's ''[[Origines]]'', the first work of [[history]] composed in [[Latin]], described Italy as the entire peninsula south of the [[Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSY-DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=cato+italy+south+of+the+Alps&amp;pg=PT49 |title=The "Birth" of Italy: The Institutionalization of Italy as a Region, 3rd–1st Century BCE |isbn=978-3-11-054478-7 |last1=Carlà-Uhink |first1=Filippo |date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the "walls of Italy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLsRDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=cato+walls+of+Italy&amp;pg=PA108 |title=Livy on the Hannibalic War |isbn=978-0-19-815295-8 |last1=Levene |first1=D.

The northern area of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and ''de facto'' part of Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSY-DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Tota+Italia+essays&amp;pg=PT454 |title=The "Birth" of Italy: The Institutionalization of Italy as a Region, 3rd–1st Century BCE |isbn=978-3-11-054478-7 |last1=Carlà-Uhink |first1=Filippo |date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained politically and ''de jure'' separated.

[[Ancient Rome|Rome]], a settlement around a ford on the river [[Tiber]] in central Italy conventionally [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a [[Roman Kingdom|monarchical]] system, initially with sovereigns of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. In 509 BC, the Romans [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|expelled the last king]] from their city, favouring a government of the [[SPQR|Senate and the People]] (SPQR) and establishing an [[Roman Republic|oligarchic republic]].

The Italian Peninsula, named [[Roman Italy|Italia]], was consolidated into a single entity during the Roman [[Roman expansion in Italy|expansion]] and conquest of new lands at the expense of the [[Samnite Wars|other Italic tribes]], [[Roman–Etruscan Wars|Etruscans]], [[Roman–Gallic wars|Celts]], and [[Pyrrhic War|Greeks]]. A [[Socii|permanent association]] with most of the local tribes and cities was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, Northern Africa and the [[History of the Middle East#Greek and Roman Empire|Middle East]]. In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s rise and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|death]] in the first century BC, Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive [[Roman empire|empire]] stretching from [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], and engulfing the whole [[Mediterranean]] basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique [[Greco-Roman world|civilisation]]. The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor, [[Augustus]], began a golden age of peace and prosperity. Italy remained the metropole of the empire, and as the homeland of the Romans and the territory of the capital, maintained a special status which made it "not a province, but the ''[[Dominus (title)|Domina]]'' (ruler) of the [[Roman province|provinces]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Theodor |author-link=Theodor Mommsen |year=1855 |title=History of Rome, Book II: From the Abolition of the Monarchy in Rome to the Union of Italy |location=Leipzig |publisher=Reimer &amp; Hirsel |title-link=History of Rome (Mommsen)}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than [[Pax Romana|two centuries of stability]] followed, during which Italy was referred to as the ''rectrix mundi'' (queen of the world) and ''omnium terrarum parens'' (motherland of all lands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fear |first=Andrew |date=25 March 2010 |title=Historiae Mundi: Studies in Universal History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hb6OAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=Rectrix%20mundi%20omnium%20terrarum%20parens&amp;pg=PA97 |isbn=978-1-4725-1980-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a slow [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline]] since the third century AD, the Empire split in two in 395 AD. The [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], under the pressure of the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]], eventually dissolved in 476 AD when its last emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed by the Germanic chief [[Odoacer]]. The [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] half of the Empire survived for another thousand years.

Invasions of the peninsula caused a chaotic succession of barbarian kingdoms and the so-called "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark ages]]". The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the [[Frankish Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the [[Papal States]] in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding with the former ([[Ghibellines]]) or with the latter ([[Guelphs]]) from momentary convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nolan |first=Cathal J. |title=The age of wars of religion, 1000–1650 : an encyclopedia of global warfare and civilization |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport (Connecticut) |isbn=978-0-313-33045-2 |page=360 |edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germanic Emperor and the Roman Pontiff became the [[universal power]]s of medieval Europe. However, the conflict for the [[investiture controversy]] (a conflict over two radically different views of whether secular authorities such as kings, counts, or dukes, had any legitimate role in appointments to ecclesiastical offices) and the clash between Guelphs and Ghibellines led to the end of the Imperial-feudal system in the north of Italy where city-states gained independence. It was during this chaotic era that Italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution, the [[medieval commune]]. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the [[Holy See]], local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Philip |title=The Italian city-state : from Commune to Signoria |year=1997 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-822585-0 |pages=55–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investiture controversy was finally resolved by the [[Concordat of Worms]]. In 1176 a league of city-states, the [[Lombard League]], defeated the German emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the [[Battle of Legnano]], thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central Italian cities.

Italian city-states such as Milan, Florence and Venice played a crucial innovative role in financial development, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Niall |first1=Ferguson |year=2008 |title=The Ascent of Money: The Financial History of the World |publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coastal and southern areas, the [[maritime republics]] grew to eventually dominate the Mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the [[Orient]].

Venice and Genoa were Europe's main gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] was a capital of silk, wool, banks and jewellery.

[[File:Italy 1494.svg|thumb|left|The [[List of historic states of Italy#Late Middle Ages|Italian states]] before the beginning of the [[Italian Wars]] in 1494]]

Italy was the birthplace and heart of the [[Renaissance]] during the 1400s and 1500s. The [[Italian Renaissance]] marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age as Europe recovered, economically and culturally, from the crises of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and entered the [[Early Modern Period]]. The Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by [[Prince]]s, ''de facto'' monarchs in control of trade and administration, and their courts became major centres of [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]]. The Italian princedoms represented a first form of modern states as opposed to feudal monarchies and multinational empires. The princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families such as the [[Medici]] in [[Florence]], the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] and [[Sforza]] in the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Doria (family)|Doria]] in the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Mocenigo]] and [[Barbarigo family|Barbarigo]] in the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[House of Este|Este]] in [[Ferrara]], and the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]].&lt;ref name="strathern" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511133416/http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm |date=11 May 2011 }}. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance was therefore a result of the great wealth accumulated by Italian merchant cities combined with the [[patronage]] of its dominant families.&lt;ref name="strathern"&gt;Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Brunelleschi]], [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], and [[Titian]], and architects such as [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Donato Bramante]].

Following the conclusion of the [[western schism]] in favour of Rome at the [[Council of Constance]] (1415–1417), the new [[Pope Martin V]] returned to the [[Papal States]] after a three years-long journey that touched many Italian cities and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity. During the course of this voyage, the [[Medici Bank]] was made the official credit institution of the Papacy and several significant ties were established between the Church and the new political dynasties of the peninsula. The Popes' status as elective monarchs turned the [[conclave]]s and [[papal consistory|consistories]] of the Renaissance into political battles between the courts of Italy for primacy in the peninsula and access to the immense resources of the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1439, [[Pope Eugenius IV]] and the Byzantine Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] signed a reconciliation agreement between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church at the [[Council of Florence]] hosted by [[Cosimo de Medici|Cosimo ''the old'' de Medici]]. In 1453, Italian forces under [[Giovanni Giustiniani]] were sent by [[Pope Nicholas V]] to defend the [[Walls of Constantinople]] but the decisive battle was lost to the more advanced Turkish army equipped with cannons, and [[Fall of Constantinople|Byzantium fell]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].

The fall of Constantinople led to the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy, fueling the rediscovery of Greco-Roman [[Humanism]].&lt;ref name="Britannica1"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Har, Michael H.

[[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', considered the manifesto of [[Renaissance Humanism]], in which he stressed the importance of [[free will]] in human beings.

Following the fall of Constantinople, the [[wars in Lombardy]] came to an end and a defensive alliance known as [[Italic League]] was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. [[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo ''the Magnificent'' de Medici]] was the greatest Florentine patron of the Renaissance and supporter of the Italic League. He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503–1513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513–1521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523–1534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.

The Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]

The Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria. During the [[Coalition Wars]], northern-central Italy was reorganised by Napoleon in a number of [[Sister Republics]] of [[France]] and later as a [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] in [[personal union]] with the [[Napoleonic France|French Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, "The Economy of the Empire in Italy: Instructions from Napoleon to Eugène, Viceroy of Italy," ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed.

Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2007), 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The southern half of the peninsula was administered by [[Joachim Murat]], Napoleon's brother-in-law, who was crowned as [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]]. The 1814 [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] could not be eradicated, and soon re-surfaced during the [[political revolution|political upheavals]] that characterised the first part of the 19th century.

The [[birth of the Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]]. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the political and social [[Italian unification]] movement, or ''Risorgimento'', emerged to unite Italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. His prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active.

The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], renowned for his extremely loyal followers,&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Modern Italy: A Political History'', (University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 15. A literary echo may be found in the character of Giorgio Viola in Joseph Conrad's ''[[Nostromo]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who led the Italian republican drive for unification in Southern Italy. However, the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|first war of independence]] was declared on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. In 1855, the Kingdom of Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the [[Crimean War]], giving Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Dal Lago, "Lincoln, Cavour, and National Unification: American Republicanism and Italian Liberal Nationalism in Comparative Perspective."

Langer, ed., ''An Encyclopedia of World Cup History''. 4th ed. 1968. pp 704–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of [[Second French Empire|France]], resulting in liberating [[Lombardy]]. On the basis of the [[Plombières Agreement]], the Kingdom of Sardinia ceded [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]] to France, an event that caused the [[Niçard exodus]], that was the emigration of a quarter of the [[Niçard Italians]] to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.montecarlonews.it/2017/08/28/notizie/argomenti/altre-notizie-1/articolo/un-nizzardo-su-quattro-prese-la-via-dellesilio-in-seguito-allunita-ditalia-dice-lo-scrittore.html|title="Un nizzardo su quattro prese la via dell'esilio" in seguito all'unità d'Italia, dice lo scrittore Casalino Pierluigi|access-date=14 May 2021|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-10895-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the House of Savoy troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. [[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860 between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.

In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterwards Italy's capital was moved to Rome. Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, Cavour and Mazzini have been referred as Italy's ''Four Fathers of the Fatherland''.&lt;ref name="scholar and patriot" /&gt;

The new Kingdom of Italy obtained [[Great Power]] status. The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.

Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)&lt;/ref&gt; From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.

Italy entered into the [[First World War]] in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the First World War is also considered the [[Fourth Italian War of Independence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piacenzaprimogenita150.it/index.php?it/176/il-1861-e-le-quattro-guerre-per-lindipendenza-1848-1918|title=Il 1861 e le quattro Guerre per l'Indipendenza (1848-1918)|language=it|access-date=12 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the [[unification of Italy]], whose military actions began during the [[revolutions of 1848]] with the [[First Italian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1239896580.html|title=La Grande Guerra nei manifesti italiani dell'epoca|language=it|access-date=12 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LntMIUOXngC&amp;q=%22quarta+guerra+d%27indipendenza%22&amp;pg=PA41|title=Il Manuale di Storia in Italia, di Piergiovanni Genovesi|isbn=9788856818680|language=it|access-date=12 March 2021|last1=Genovesi|first1=Piergiovanni|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" top Allied powers. The war on the [[Italian front (World War I)|Italian Front]] was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory,&lt;ref&gt;Burgwyn, H.

Italian armed forces were also involved in the [[African theatre of World War I|African theatre]], the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Balkan theatre]], the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] and then took part in the [[Occupation of Constantinople]].

During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La Salute pubblica in Italia durante e dopo la Guerra |last=Mortara |first=G |year=1925 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (1919) and the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] (1920) allowed the annexation of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino Alto-Adige]], [[Julian March]], [[Istria]], [[Kvarner Gulf|Kvarner]] as well as the [[Dalmatia]]n city of [[Zadar|Zara]]. The subsequent [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|Treaty of Rome]] (1924) led to the annexation of the city of [[Fiume]] to Italy. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)]], so this outcome was denounced as a "[[Mutilated victory]]". The rhetoric of "Mutilated victory" was adopted by [[Benito Mussolini]] and led to the [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|rise of]] [[Italian fascism]], becoming a key point in the [[propaganda of Fascist Italy]]. Historians regard "Mutilated victory" as a "political myth", used by fascists to fuel [[Italian imperialism]] and obscure the successes of [[liberal Italy]] in the aftermath of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;G.Sabbatucci, ''La vittoria mutilata'', in AA.VV., ''Miti e storia dell'Italia unita'', Il Mulino, Bologna 1999, pp.101-106&lt;/ref&gt; Italy also gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council.

The [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]] named the "[[March on Rome]]" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].

Italian Fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' by incorporating ''[[Italian irredentism|Italia Irredenta]]'' (unredeemed Italy) into the state of Italy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1922"&gt;Aristotle A.

In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]].

The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

[[File:01 partigiani a milano1.jpg|thumb|[[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] in Milan, April 1945]]

An [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on [[25 Luglio|25 July]]. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.

In the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Marino |last=Viganò |title=Un'analisi accurata della presunta fuga in Svizzera |journal=Nuova Storia Contemporanea |volume=3 |year=2001 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was captured and [[Death of Benito Mussolini|summarily executed]] near [[Lake Como]] by Italian partisans.

Fears of a possible Communist takeover (especially in the United States) proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on [[Italian general election, 1948|18 April 1948]], when the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], obtained a landslide victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV-ti1sYcbcC |title=NATO 1948: The Birth of the Transatlantic Alliance |author1=Lawrence S.

The [[Marshall Plan]] helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the "[[Italian economic miracle|Economic Miracle]]". In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterised by economic crisis (especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi (Parliamentary investigative commission on terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify the perpetrators) |year=1995 |access-date=2 May 2006 |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819211212/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date=19 August 2006 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Docs"&gt;{{in lang|en|it|fr|de}} {{cite web |title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies |access-date=2 May 2006 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology / International Relation and Security Network |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425182721/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm |archive-date=25 April 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |title=Clarion: Philip Willan, Guardian, 24 June 2000, p. 19 |publisher=Cambridgeclarion.org |date=24 June 2000 |access-date=24 April 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329113138/http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |archive-date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 and the [[Bologna massacre|Bologna railway station massacre]] in 1980, where 85 people died.

In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican ([[Giovanni Spadolini]]) and one socialist ([[Bettino Craxi]]); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained the entry into the [[Group of Seven]] in the 1970s. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country's GDP.

Italy faced several terror attacks between 1992 and 1993 perpetrated by the [[Sicilian Mafia]] as a consequence of several life sentences pronounced during the "[[Maxi Trial]]", and of the new anti-mafia measures launched by the government. In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges [[Giovanni Falcone]] (23 May in the [[Capaci bombing]]) and [[Paolo Borsellino]] (19 July in the [[Via D'Amelio bombing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.corriere.it/International/english/articoli/2012/03/08/borsellino.shtml |title=New Arrests for Via D'Amelio Bomb Attack |publisher=corriere.it |date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later (May–July 1993), tourist spots were attacked, such as the [[Via dei Georgofili bombing|Via dei Georgofili]] in Florence, [[Via Palestro massacre|Via Palestro]] in Milan, and the Piazza [[San Giovanni in Laterano]] and Via San Teodoro in Rome, leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the [[Uffizi Gallery]].

The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called "Second Republic" was born by forceps: not with a revolt of Algiers, but formally under the same Constitution, with the mere replacement of one ruling class to another: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=Tovaglie pulite |journal=Mondoperaio Edizione Online |date=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists reorganised as a [[social-democratic]] force. During the 1990s and the 2000s, [[Centre-right coalition|centre-right]] (dominated by media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) and [[Centre-left coalition|centre-left]] coalitions (led by university professor [[Romano Prodi]]) alternately governed the country.

Italy is located in [[Southern Europe]] (it is also considered a part of [[western Europe]])&lt;ref name="DGACM" /&gt; between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]]. To the north, Italy borders [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], and [[Slovenia]] and is roughly delimited by the [[Alps|Alpine watershed]], enclosing the [[Po Valley]] and the [[Venetian Plain]]. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the two [[Mediterranean islands]] of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] (the two [[Mediterranean islands#By area|biggest islands]] of the Mediterranean), in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521449/San-Marino |title=San Marino |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2012 |access-date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17994868 |title=Vatican country profile |date=2018 |work=BBC News|access-date=24 August 2018 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Campione d'Italia]] is an Italian [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Democracy in Figures|url=http://demo.istat.it/index_e.php|website=[[Italian National Institute of Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's total area is {{convert|301230|km2|0|abbr=out}}, of which {{convert|294020|km2|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|7210|km2|0|abbr=on}} is water.&lt;ref name=Area&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/137001 |title=Principali dimensioni geostatistiche e grado di urbanizzazione del Paese |date=30 October 2014 |website=www.istat.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of {{convert|7600|km|0|abbr=off}} on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]], [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas ({{convert|740|km|0|abbr=on}}), and borders shared with France ({{convert|488|km|0|abbr=on}}), Austria ({{convert|430|km|0|abbr=on}}), Slovenia ({{convert|232|km|0|abbr=on}}) and Switzerland ({{convert|740|km|0|abbr=on}}).

The [[Po river|Po]], Italy's longest river ({{convert|652|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}}), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the [[Padan plain]] on its way to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with {{convert|46,000|km2|abbr=on}}, and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.&lt;ref name=eug92 /&gt;

Many elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south, like [[Capraia]], [[Ponza]], [[Ischia]], [[Aeolian Islands|Eolie]], [[Ustica]] and [[Pantelleria]] are [[volcanic island]]s.
There are also active volcanoes: [[Mount Etna]] in Sicily (the largest active volcano in Europe), [[Vulcano]], [[Stromboli]], and [[Vesuvius]] (the only active volcano on mainland Europe).

The five largest lakes are, in order of diminishing size:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iii.to.cnr.it/limnol/cicloac/lagit.htm |title=Morphometric and hydrological characteristics of some important Italian lakes |publisher=Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi |access-date=3 March 2010 |location= Verbania Pallanza |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205043503/http://www.iii.to.cnr.it/limnol/cicloac/lagit.htm |archive-date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Garda|Garda]] ({{convert|367.94|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Lake Maggiore|Maggiore]] ({{convert|212.51|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, whose minor northern part is Switzerland), [[Lake Como|Como]] ({{convert|145.9|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Trasimeno Lake|Trasimeno]] ({{convert|124.29|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Lake Bolsena|Bolsena]] ({{convert|113.55|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

Although the country includes the Italian peninsula, adjacent islands, and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the [[Eurasia]]n continental shelf. These territories are the ''comuni'' of: [[Livigno]], [[Sexten]], [[Innichen]], [[Toblach]] (in part), [[Chiusaforte]], [[Tarvisio]], [[Graun im Vinschgau]] (in part), which are all part of the [[Danube#Drainage basin|Danube's drainage basin]], while the [[Lago di Lei|Val di Lei]] constitutes part of the [[Rhine]]'s basin and the islands of [[Lampedusa]] and [[Lampione]] are on the African [[continental shelf]].

The Apennines run along the entire length of the peninsula, dividing the waters into two opposite sides. On the other hand, the rivers are numerous due to the relative abundance of rains and to the presence of the Alpine chain in northern Italy with snowfields and glaciers. The fundamental watershed follows the ridge of the Alps and the Apennines and delimits five main slopes, corresponding to the seas into which the rivers flow: the Adriatic, Ionic, Tyrrhenian, Ligurian and Mediterranean sides.&lt;ref name=Londrillo&gt;{{cite book |author=Antonio Londrillo |title=Alla scoperta della mia regione |language=it |publisher=Bulgarini |year=2004 |isbn=88-234-2327-9 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into consideration their origin, the Italian rivers can be divided into two main groups: the Alpine-Po rivers and the Apennine-island rivers.&lt;ref name=Londrillo/&gt;

Most of the [[rivers of Italy]] drain either into the Adriatic Sea, such as the [[Po (river)|Po]], [[Piave (river)|Piave]], [[Adige]], [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], [[Tagliamento]], and [[Reno River|Reno]], or into the Tyrrhenian, like the [[Arno]], [[Tiber]] and [[Volturno]]. The waters from some border municipalities ([[Livigno]] in [[Lombardy]], [[Innichen]] and [[Sexten]] in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]) drain into the [[Black Sea]] through the basin of the [[Drava]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Danube]], and the waters from the [[Lago di Lei]] in Lombardy drain into the [[North Sea]] through the basin of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/fiumi/ |title=List of Italian rivers |publisher=comuni-italiani.it |access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest Italian river is Po, which flows either {{cvt|652|km|mi}} or {{cvt|682|km|mi}} (considering the length of the right bank tributary [[Maira (river)|Maira]]) and whose headwaters are a spring seeping from a stony hillside at Pian del Re, a flat place at the head of the [[Val Po]] under the northwest face of [[Monviso]].

The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable [[List of earthquakes in Italy|seismic]] and [[Volcanism in Italy|volcanic activity]]. There are [[List of volcanoes in Italy|14 volcanoes in Italy]], four of which are active: [[Mount Etna|Etna]], [[Stromboli]], [[Vulcano]] and [[Vesuvius]]. The last is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculanum]] in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption in 79 AD]]. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active [[caldera]], the [[Campi Flegrei]] north-west of Naples.

The high volcanic and magmatic neogenic activity is subdivided into provinces:
* Magmatic Tuscan ([[Monti Cimini]], [[Tolfa]] and [[Amiata]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alexstrekeisen.it/vulc/pmt.php |title=ALEX STREKEISEN |website=www.alexstrekeisen.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scro&gt;{{Harvnb|Scrocca et al.|ref=cidScro}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Blair, ''Climatology: General and Regional'', Prentice Hall pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastal areas of [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]] and most of the [[Southern Italy|South]] generally fit the [[Mediterranean climate]] stereotype ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to
{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers can be hot and humid across the country, particularly in the south while northern and central areas can experience occasional strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Atlas of Italy |url=http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng |publisher=Network of the Air Force Meteorological Service |access-date=30 September 2012|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114223307/http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng |archive-date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy has been a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]]. The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943–1946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205–222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}{{Main|Government of Italy}}
Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.

[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]

The prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&amp;nbsp;– which holds effective executive power&amp;nbsp;– and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].

Another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us – Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archive-date=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]]. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterised also by a small number of [[senator for life|senators for life]], appointed by the President "for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field". Former Presidents of the Republic are ''ex officio'' life senators.

Italy's three major political parties are the [[Five Star Movement]], the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Lega Nord|Lega]]. During the 2018 general election these three parties and their coalitions won 614 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 309 out of 315 in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180321/italy-new-parliament |title=Italy's new parliament is younger, more diverse and more female |date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi's [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] which formed a centre-right coalition with [[Matteo Salvini]]'s [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] and Giorgia Meloni's [[Brothers of Italy]] won most of the seats without getting the majority in parliament. The rest of the seats were taken by [[Five Star Movement]], Matteo Renzi's [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] along with Achammer and Panizza's [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] &amp; [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]] in a centre-left coalition and the independent [[Free and Equal (Italy)|Free and Equal]] party.

=== Law and criminal justice ===
{{Main|Law of Italy|Judiciary of Italy}}
[[File:Courthouse facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]]]]

The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later statutes. The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] (''Corte Costituzionale'') rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post–World War II innovation. Since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, [[Organized crime in Italy|Italian organised crime]] and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in [[Southern Italy]], the most notorious of which being the [[Sicilian Mafia]], which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States.

Italy is a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), now the [[European Union]] (EU), and of [[NATO]]. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and a strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]] (GATT/WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Initiative]]. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2018, the [[G7]] in 2017 and the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Council]] from July to December 2014. Italy is also a recurrent [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member]] of the [[UN Security Council]], the most recently in 2017.

Italy strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its [[international security]] activities. {{As of|2013}}, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Missioni/Attivita' Internazionali DAL 1 October 2013 AL 31 December 2013 – Situazione AL 11 December 2013 |url=http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf |publisher=Italian Ministry of Defence |access-date=27 January 2014|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175427/http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf |archive-date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in [[UNITAF|Somalia]], [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor|East Timor]] and provides support for NATO and UN operations in [[IFOR|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]] and [[Operation Sunrise (Albania)|Albania]]. Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) from February 2003.

Italy supported international efforts to reconstruct and stabilise [[Iraq]], but it had withdrawn its [[Multi-National Force – Iraq#2006 withdrawals|military contingent]] of some 3,200 troops by 2006, maintaining only humanitarian operators and other civilian personnel.

Renewable sources account for the 27.5% of all electricity produced in Italy, with hydro alone reaching 12.6%, followed by solar at 5.7%, wind at 4.1%, bioenergy at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6%.&lt;ref name="gse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gse.it/it/Statistiche/RapportiStatistici/Pagine/default.aspx |title=Rapporto Statistico sugli Impianti a fonti rinnovabili |date=19 December 2013 |publisher=Gestore dei Servizi Energetici |format=PDF |access-date=11 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018022905/http://www.gse.it/it/Statistiche/RapportiStatistici/Pagine/default.aspx |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the national demand is covered by fossil fuels (38.2% natural gas, 13% coal, 8.4% oil) and by imports.&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt;

Italy has managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s. However, [[nuclear power in Italy]] has been abandoned following a [[Italian referendums, 1987|1987 referendum]] (in the wake of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in Soviet Ukraine).

Through the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences. During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].

Other astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–1576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–1954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segrè]] (1905–1989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905–1993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Orlando, "Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the" New Tasks" of Physics in Italy." ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141–181. {{jstor|27757806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Andrew.

[[File:Map of population density in Italy (2011 census) alt colours.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Italy's population density as of the 2011 census]]

At the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="istat.it" /&gt; The resulting population density, at {{convert|202|PD/km2}}, is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are very sparsely populated.

The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950–1960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. The population rapidly [[population ageing|aged]]; by 2010, one in five Italians was over 65 years old, and the country currently has the fifth oldest population in the world, with a [[median age]] of 46.5 years.&lt;ref name="cia.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF |title=Ageing characterises the demographic perspectives of the European societies – Issue number 72/2008 |author=EUROSTAT |access-date=28 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102184227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF |archive-date=2 January 2009 |author-link=EUROSTAT}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years Italy has experienced significant growth in birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_1.pdf |title=Crude birth rates, mortality rates and marriage rates 2005–2008 |author=ISTAT |access-date=10 May 2009 |language=it|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810171721/http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_1.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2011|author-link=Istituto Nazionale di Statistica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_4.pdf |title=Average number of children born per woman 2005–2008 |author=ISTAT |access-date=3 May 2009 |language=it|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810171708/http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_4.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2011|author-link=Istituto Nazionale di Statistica}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit still below the [[replacement rate]] of 2.1 and considerably below the high of 5.06 children born per woman in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman?year=1800&amp;country=ITA |title=Total Fertility Rate around the world over the last centuries |author=Max Roser |date=2014 |work=[[Our World In Data]], [[Gapminder Foundation]]|access-date=7 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807185906/https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman?year=1800&amp;country=ITA|archive-date=7 August 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[total fertility rate]] is expected to reach 1.6–1.8 in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/uniprev2011/index.html?lingua=ita |title=Previsioni della popolazione, 2011–2065, dati al 1° gennaio |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306125456/http://demo.istat.it/uniprev2011/index.html?lingua=ita |archive-date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
{{Main|Immigration to Italy}}

[[File:COB data Italy.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Italy is home to a large population of migrants from Eastern Europe and North Africa.]]

In 2016, Italy had about 5.05 million foreign residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resident Foreigners on 31st December 2016 |url=http://demo.istat.it/index_e.html |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]] |access-date=15 June 2017|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622080908/http://www.demo.istat.it/index_e.html |archive-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making up 8.3% of the total population.

Starting from the early 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy begun to attract substantial flows of foreign immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Beverly |title=Revisioning Italy national identity and global culture |url=https://archive.org/details/revisioningitaly00beve|url-access=registration |date=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-2727-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/revisioningitaly00beve/page/169 169]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and, more recently, the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2007]] enlargements of the European Union, large waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (especially [[Romania]], [[Albania]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]). An equally important source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa (in particular, [[Morocco]], Egypt and [[Tunisia]]), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the [[Arab Spring]]. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably [[China]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6550725.stm Milan police in Chinatown clash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010205822/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6550725.stm |date=10 October 2017 }}".

Currently, about one million [[Romanian diaspora|Romanian]] citizens (around 10% of them being ethnic [[Romani people]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42404 EUROPE: Home to Roma, And No Place for Them]".

The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029110649/http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 October 2008 |title=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network |publisher=Birn.eu.com |date=8 November 2007 |access-date=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37% of 2.8&amp;nbsp;million immigrants in that country&lt;ref&gt;Mitrica, Mihai [https://web.archive.org/web/20071023072029/http://evz.ro/article.php?artid=201813 Un milion de romani s-au mutat in Italia] ("One million Romanians have moved to Italy"). ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 31 October 2005. Visited 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is unclear how the estimate was made, and therefore whether it should be taken seriously.|group=note}}

As of 2010, the foreign born population of Italy was from the following regions: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half.

Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s due to economic growth and the rise of [[Media of Italy|mass media]] and television (the state broadcaster [[RAI]] helped set a standard Italian).

Twelve "historical [[minority language]]s" (''minoranze linguistiche storiche'') are formally recognised: [[Arberesh language|Albanian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[French language|French]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Friulian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Occitan]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; Four of these also enjoy a co-official status in their respective region: French in the [[Aosta Valley]];&lt;ref&gt;[L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, Statuto speciale per la Valle d'Aosta&lt;/ref&gt; German in [[South Tyrol]], and [[Ladin language|Ladin]] as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the neighbouring [[Trentino]];&lt;ref&gt;L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 5, Statuto speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] in the provinces of [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]].&lt;ref&gt;L. cost. 31 gennaio 1963, n. 1, Statuto speciale della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised by Italian law.

Because of recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a regional language. According to the [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italian National Institute of Statistics]], [[Romanian people|Romanian]] is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of the foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are [[Arabic]] (spoken by over 475,000 people; 13.1% of foreign residents), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (380,000 people) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (255,000 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304 |title=Linguistic diversity among foreign citizens in Italy |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italian National Institute of Statistics]] |access-date=27 July 2014|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730134706/http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304 |archive-date=30 July 2014 |date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary education lasts eight years. Students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, physical education and visual and musical arts. Secondary education lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the ''[[Secondary education in Italy#liceo|liceo]]'' prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum, while the ''[[istituto tecnico]]'' and the ''[[Istituto professionale]]'' prepare pupils for vocational education.

During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a number of magnificent [[Court (royal)|courts]] competed for attracting the best architects, artists and scholars, thus producing a great legacy of monuments, paintings, music and literature. Despite the political and social isolation of these courts, Italy's contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Alison |title=Virtue and magnificence : art of the Italian Renaissance courts |year=1995 |publisher=H.N.

Italy has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the [[Italian diaspora]]. Furthermore, Italy has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains),&lt;ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2005, pg. 19"&gt;Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and according to some estimates the nation is home to half the world's great art treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbot |first=Charles |date=2006 |title=Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuWGa48iQMC&amp;pg=PA101 |publisher=Morellini Editore |page=101 |isbn=978-88-89550-13-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp Architecture in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115053940/http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp |date=15 January 2012 }}, ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt; such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during [[ancient Rome]], the founding of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architectural movement]] in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of [[Palladianism]], a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of [[Neoclassical architecture]], and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries.

Along with pre-historic architecture, the first people in Italy to truly begin a sequence of designs were the Greeks and the Etruscans, progressing to classical Roman,&lt;ref&gt;Sear, Frank. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rkdt_p6uvw0C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Roman architecture.''] Cornell University Press, 1983. p. 10. Web. 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; then to the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance and evolving into the Baroque era. The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. They were known for being long, rectangular buildings, which were built in an almost ancient Roman style, often rich in mosaics and decorations. The early Christians' art and architecture was also widely inspired by that of the pagan Romans; statues, mosaics and paintings decorated all their churches.&lt;ref name=byzan&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/christian-byzanthine.asp Italy Architecture: Early Christian and Byzanthine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328131150/http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/christian-byzanthine.asp |date=28 March 2013 }}, ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant buildings in the medieval Romanesque style were churches built in Italy during the 800's. Byzantine architecture was also widely diffused in Italy. The Byzantines kept Roman principles of architecture and art alive, and the most famous structure from this period is the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica of St. Mark]] in Venice.

The Romanesque movement, which went from approximately 800 AD to 1100 AD, was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Italian architecture, when several masterpieces, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the [[Piazza dei Miracoli]], and the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan were built. It was known for its usage of the Roman arches, stained glass windows, and also its curved columns which commonly featured in cloisters. The main innovation of Italian Romanesque architecture was the vault, which had never been seen before in the history of Western architecture.&lt;ref name=romanesque&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/romanesque.asp Italy Architecture: Romanesque] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328120342/http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/romanesque.asp |date=28 March 2013 }}, ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest flowering of Italian architecture took place during the Renaissance. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] made great contributions to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence, a feat of engineering that had not been accomplished since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Italian Renaissance Art |last1=Campbell |first1=Stephen J |last2=Cole |first2=Michael Wayne |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Inc |year=2012 |location=New York |pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular achievement of Italian Renaissance architecture was St. Peter's Basilica, originally designed by [[Donato Bramante]] in the early 16th century. Also, Andrea Palladio influenced architects throughout western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed in the middle and late 16th century; the city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and twenty-four [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed by UNESCO as part of a World Heritage Site named [[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/712/ |title=City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baroque period produced several outstanding Italian architects in the 17th century, especially known for their churches. The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the [[Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi]], dating back to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;R. De Fusco, ''A thousand years of architecture in Europe'', pg. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] began in 1752 the construction of the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]]. In this large complex, the grandiose Baroque style interiors and gardens are opposed to a more sober building envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Architecture and Geometry in the Age of the Baroque |last=Hersey |first=George |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-226-32784-1 |location=Chicago |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was affected by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Everything from villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes.&lt;ref name=Neoclassic&gt;[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/neoclassicism.asp Italy Architecture: Neoclassicism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328084932/http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/neoclassicism.asp |date=28 March 2013 }}, ItalyTravel.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Fascist period, the so-called "[[Novecento movement]]" flourished, based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome, with figures such as [[Gio Ponti]] and [[Giovanni Muzio]]. [[Marcello Piacentini]], responsible for the urban transformations of several cities in Italy and remembered for the disputed [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome, devised a form of simplified Neoclassicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/renzo-piano |title=Renzo Piano |website=Nytimes.com |access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual art ===

The history of Italian visual arts is significant to the history of [[Western painting]]. [[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. Roman painting does have its own unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy. Such paintings can be grouped into four main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726163006/http://art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |archive-date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archive-date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].

In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.

In the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]]. [[Impressionism]] was brought from France to Italy by the ''[[Macchiaioli]]'', led by [[Giovanni Fattori]], and [[Giovanni Boldini]]; [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] by [[Gioacchino Toma]] and [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]]. In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow like [[Bruno Caruso]] and [[Renato Guttuso]].

Formal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, George Eckel.

Web. 15 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin literature was, and still is, highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]] and [[Livy]]. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetry and Drama: Literary Terms and Concepts.|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date=2011|url={{Google books|LHA_SydyKOYC|page=PA39|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|access-date=18 October 2011|isbn=978-1-61530-490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early years of the 13th century, St. [[Francis of Assisi]] was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics, with his religious song ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter=2 – Poetry.

Another Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. The most important of these poets was the notary [[Giacomo da Lentini]], inventor of the [[sonnet]] form, though the most famous early sonneteer was [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Hatch Wilkins, ''The invention of the sonnet, and other studies in Italian literature'' (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e letteratura, 1959), 11–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guido Guinizelli]] is considered the founder of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'', a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and the [[Florence|Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], who established the basis of the modern [[Italian language]]; his greatest work, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult ''[[terza rima]]''. The two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written.&lt;ref name=Britannica-Shakespeare&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Giovanni Boccaccio: The Decameron.| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron| access-date = 18 December 2013| url-status=live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020413/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron| archive-date = 19 December 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], founder of modern political science and ethics]]

Italian Renaissance authors produced a number of important works. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' is one of the world's most famous essays on political science and modern philosophy, in which the "effectual truth" is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Another important work of the period, [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', continuation of [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s unfinished romance ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s dialogue ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet [[Torquato Tasso]] in ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' wrote a Christian epic, making use of the ''[[ottava rima]]'', with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.

[[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], which have written ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' (1550–1555) and the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634) respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Swann Jones, ''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination'', Twayne Publishers, New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8057-0950-9}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bottigheimer 2012a, 7; Waters 1894, xii; Zipes 2015, 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Opie |first1=Iona |author-link2=Peter Opie |first2=Peter |last2=Opie |author-link=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |location=Oxford and New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-19-211559-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/classicfairytale00opie_0 }} See p. 20. The claim for earliest fairy-tale is still debated, see for example Jan M. Ziolkowski, ''Fairy tales from before fairy tales: the medieval Latin past of wonderful lies'', University of Michigan Press, 2007. Ziolkowski examines [[Egbert of Liège]]'s Latin beast poem ''Fecunda natis'' (''The Richly Laden Ship'', c. 1022/24), the earliest known version of "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]".

Leithart, 9 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as [[Giambattista Marino]]'s long mythological poem, ''[[Giambattista Marino#L'Adone|L'Adone]]''. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] as well as [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun]]'', a description of a perfect society ruled by a philosopher-priest. At the end of the 17th century, the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadians]] began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in [[Metastasio]]'s heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] created full written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day.

The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Ugo Foscolo]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. The works by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of the Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language; his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.&lt;ref name="Archibald Colquhoun 1954"&gt;Archibald Colquhoun.

In the late 19th century, a realistic literary movement called ''[[Verismo (literature)|Verismo]]'' played a major role in Italian literature; [[Giovanni Verga]] and [[Luigi Capuana]] were its main exponents. In the same period, [[Emilio Salgari]], writer of action-adventure [[swashbuckler]]s and a pioneer of science fiction, published his ''[[Sandokan]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url={{Google books|d9NcAgAAQBAJ|page=PA1654|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|page=1654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] also published the novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author and the most translated non-religious book in the world.&lt;ref name=Gasparini&gt;Giovanni Gasparini. ''La corsa di Pinocchio''. Milano, Vita e Pensiero, 1997. p. 117. {{ISBN|88-343-4889-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movement called [[Futurism]] influenced Italian literature in the early 20th century. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] wrote ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0-7148-3542-6|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the ages, Italian philosophy and literature had a vast influence on [[Western philosophy]], beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto [[Renaissance humanism]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[modern philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Garin&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVP3vBmDktQC |title=History of Italian Philosophy |last=Garin |first=Eugenio |year=2008 |publisher=VIBS|isbn=9789042023215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy was brought to Italy by [[Pythagoras]], founder of the Italian school of philosophy in [[Crotone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herodotus |title=The Histories |page=226 |publisher=Penguin Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Italian philosophers of the [[Magna Graecia|Greek period]] include [[Xenophanes]], [[Parmenides]], [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], [[Empedocles]] and [[Gorgias]].

Italy also had a renowned philosophical movement in the 1800s, with [[Idealism]], [[Sensism]] and [[Empiricism]]. The main Sensist Italian philosophers were [[Melchiorre Gioja]] and [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]].&lt;ref name="maritain.nd.edu"/&gt; Criticism of the Sensist movement came from other philosophers such as [[Pasquale Galluppi]] (1770–1846), who affirmed that ''a priori'' relationships were synthetic.&lt;ref name="maritain.nd.edu"/&gt; [[Antonio Rosmini]], instead, was the founder of [[Italian Idealism]]. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, there were also several other movements which gained some form of popularity in Italy, such as [[Ontologism]] (whose main philosopher was [[Vincenzo Gioberti]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scarangello |first1=Anthony |title=Major Catholic-Liberal Educational Philosophers of the Italian Risorgimento |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=1964 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=232–250|doi=10.2307/367499 |jstor=367499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism in Italy|anarchism]], communism, socialism, futurism, fascism and Christian democracy.

Italian philosophers were also influential in the development of the non-Marxist [[liberal socialism]] philosophy, including [[Carlo Rosselli]], [[Norberto Bobbio]], [[Piero Gobetti]] and [[Aldo Capitini]]. In the 1960s, many Italian left-wing activists adopted the [[anti-authoritarian]] pro-working class leftist theories that would become known as [[autonomism]] and ''[[operaismo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nanni |last1= Balestrini |first2=Primo |last2=Moroni |title=L'orda d'oro 1968–1977.

{{Main|Commedia dell'arte}}

Italian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''. Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]]. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Commedia Dell'Arte |author1=Chaffee, Judith |author2=Crick, Olly |publisher=Rutledge Taylor and Francis Group |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-415-74506-2 |location=London and New York |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded Commedia dell'arte performances came from Rome as early as 1551,{{sfn|Katritzky|2006|p=82}} and was performed outdoors in temporary venues by professional actors who were costumed and masked, as opposed to {{lang|it|commedia erudita}}, which were written comedies, presented indoors by untrained and unmasked actors.&lt;ref name=Rudlin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudlin|first1=John|last2=Crick|first2=Oliver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgMKhwelZzUC|title=Commedia dell'arte: A Handbook for Troupes|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=041-520-408-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-16th century, specific troupes of ''commedia'' performers began to coalesce, and by 1568 the [[I Gelosi|Gelosi]] became a distinct company. ''Commedia'' often performed inside in court theatres or halls, and also as some fixed theatres such as Teatro Baldrucca in Florence. Flaminio Scala, who had been a minor performer in the Gelosi published the scenarios of the ''commedia dell'arte'' around the start of the 17th century, really in an effort to legitimize the form—and ensure its legacy. These scenari are highly structured and built around the symmetry of the various types in duet: two {{lang|it|zanni}}, {{lang|it|vecchi}}, {{lang|it|inamorate}} and {{lang|it|inamorati}}, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Compagnia-dei-Gelosi|title=Compagnia dei Gelosi|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=20 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dario Fo in Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|[[Dario Fo]], one of the most widely performed playwrights in modern theatre, received international acclaim for his highly [[Improvisational theatre|improvisational]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Tony |last=Mitchell |title=Dario Fo: People's Court Jester (Updated and Expanded) |location=London |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrdMAgAAQBAJ |year=1999 |isbn=0-413-73320-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Antonio |last=Scuderi |title=Dario Fo: Framing, Festival, and the Folkloric Imagination |publisher=Lanham (Md.): Lexington Books |year=2011 |isbn=9780739151112}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ''commedia dell'arte'', female roles were played by women, documented as early as the 1560s, making them the first known professional actresses in Europe since antiquity. [[Lucrezia Di Siena]], whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with [[Vincenza Armani]] and [[Barbara Flaminia]] as the first primadonnas and the first well documented actresses in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Oreglia (2002). Commedia dell'arte. Ordfront. {{ISBN|91-7324-602-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy. It began during the Italian Renaissance court as an outgrowth of court pageantry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/balt/hd_balt.htm|title=The Ballet|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where aristocratic weddings were lavish celebrations. Court musicians and dancers collaborated to provide elaborate entertainment for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelminn.net/andros/index.php?de_medici_catherine|title=Andros on Ballet – Catherine Medici De|work=michaelminn.net|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209205503/http://www.michaelminn.net/andros/index.php?de_medici_catherine|archive-date=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domenico da Piacenza]] was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students, [[Antonio Cornazzano]] and [[Guglielmo Ebreo]], he was trained in dance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work: '' De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi'' (On the art of dancing and conducting dances), which was put together by his students.

At first, ballets were woven in to the midst of an opera to allow the audience a moment of relief from the dramatic intensity. By the mid-seventeenth century, Italian ballets in their entirety were performed in between the acts of an opera. Over time, Italian ballets became a more beloved and important part of theatrical life: ballet companies in Italy's major opera houses employed an average of four to twelve dancers; in 1815 many companies employed anywhere from eighty to one hundred dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Hansell (1980), Opera and Ballet, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlo Goldoni]], who wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, superseded the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners through the characters and their behaviours. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before. Italian theatre has been active in producing contemporary European work and in staging important revivals, including the works of [[Luigi Pirandello]] and [[Dario Fo]].

The [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world, opening in 1737, decades before both the Milan's [[La Scala]] and Venice's [[La Fenice]] theatres.&lt;ref name=SanCarlo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teatrosancarlo.it/teatro/il?_locale |title=The Theatre and its history |publisher=Teatro di San Carlo's official website |date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erlich |first=Cyril |title=The Piano: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press, US; Revised edition |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-19-816171-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Edward Heron |title=Violin-making, as it was and is: Being a Historical, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Science and Art of Violin-making, for the Use of Violin Makers and Players, Amateur and Professional.

Italy's most famous composers include the [[List of Renaissance composers#Italian|Renaissance composers]] [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]], the [[List of Baroque composers|Baroque composers]] [[Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], the [[List of Classical era composers|Classical composers]] [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]], [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and the [[List of Romantic-era composers|Romantic composers]] [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. Modern Italian composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]] proved significant in the development of [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[electronic music]]. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as ''[[La Scala]]'' of Milan and ''[[Teatro di San Carlo|San Carlo]]'' of Naples (the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world),&lt;ref name=SanCarlo /&gt; and performers such as the pianist [[Maurizio Pollini]] and tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene.

Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco]] and [[electronic music]], with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scene and heard: Italo-disco |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/01/sceneandhearditalodisco |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=14 July 2012 |location=London |first=John |last=McDonnell |date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By circa 1988, the genre had merged into other forms of European dance and electronic music, such as [[Italo house]], which blended elements of Italo disco with traditional house music; its sound was generally uplifting, and made strong usage of piano melodies. Some bands of this genre are [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], [[East Side Beat]], and [[49ers (band)|49ers]]. By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as [[Italo dance]] emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Notable Italian DJs and remixers include [[Gabry Ponte]] (member of the group [[Eiffel 65]]), [[Benny Benassi]], [[Gigi D'Agostino]], and the trio [[Tacabro]].

Producers such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s and four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[electronic dance music]].&lt;ref name=Moroder /&gt; Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7817 |publisher=www.esctoday.com |access-date=18 August 2011 |title=Sanremo Music Festival kicks off tonight |date=27 February 2007 |author=Yiorgos Kasapoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers such as [[Mina (Italian singer)|Mina]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], [[Zucchero Fornaciari|Zucchero]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]] and [[Tiziano Ferro]] have attained international acclaim.

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Italy}}
The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing [[Pope Leo XIII]] giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the [[Società Italiana Cines]], the [[Ambrosio Film]] and the [[Itala Film]]. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by [[Benito Mussolini]], who founded Rome's renowned [[Cinecittà]] studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |title=The Cinema Under Mussolini |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |access-date=30 October 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731200507/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |archive-date=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Italian film was widely recognised and exported until an artistic decline around the 1980s. [[List of film directors from Italy|Notable Italian film directors]] from this period include [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Roberto Rossellini]]; some of these are recognised among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=The Bicycle Thief / Bicycle Thieves (1949) |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990319/REVIEWS08/903190306/1023 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=8 September 2011|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227023704/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19990319%2FREVIEWS08%2F903190306%2F1023 |archive-date=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-25-most-influential-directors-of-all-time-3358/ |title=The 25 Most Influential Directors of All Time |work=MovieMaker Magazine|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211230213/http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-25-most-influential-directors-of-all-time-3358 |archive-date=11 December 2015 |date=7 July 2002|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movies include world cinema treasures such as ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[La dolce vita]]'', ''[[8½]]'', ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''.

As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other [[film genre]]s, such as [[sword-and-sandal]] followed as [[Spaghetti Western]]s, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Actresses such as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Giulietta Masina]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] achieved international stardom during this period. Erotic Italian thrillers, or ''[[giallo]]s'', produced by directors such as [[Mario Bava]] and [[Dario Argento]] in the 1970s, also influenced the horror genre worldwide. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' directed by [[Roberto Benigni]], ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'' with [[Massimo Troisi]] and ''[[The Great Beauty]]'' directed by [[Paolo Sorrentino]].

The aforementioned [[Cinecittà]] studio is today the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where many of the biggest box office hits are filmed, and one of the biggest production communities in the world. In the 1950s, the number of international productions being made there led to Rome's being dubbed "''[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]''". More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, of which 90 received an [[Academy Award]] nomination and 47 of these won it, from some cinema classics to recent rewarded features (such as ''[[Roman Holiday]]'', ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', and ''[[Gangs of New York]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Italian Cinema: From Neorealism to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PiTBFMc7tp4C |publisher=Continuum |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-8264-1247-8 |language=en |first=Peter E. |last=Bondanella |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
