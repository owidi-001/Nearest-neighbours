According to tradition, in 610 [[Common Era|CE]], the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations, calling for submission to the one God, the expectation of the imminent Last Judgement, and caring for the poor and needy.&lt;ref name="Muhammad p. 363"&gt;"Key themes in these early recitations include the idea of the moral responsibility of man who was created by God and the idea of the judgment to take place on the day of resurrection. [...] Another major theme of Muhammad's early preaching, [... is that] there is a power greater than man's, and that the wise will acknowledge this power and cease their greed and suppression of the poor." F.&amp;nbsp;Buhl &amp; A.T.&amp;nbsp;Welch, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Muhammad", vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;363.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's message [[Timing of Sahabah becoming Muslims|won over a handful of followers]] and was met with [[Persecution of Muslims by Meccans|increasing opposition from Meccan notables]].&lt;ref name="Mecca. p. 364"&gt;"At first Muhammad met with no serious opposition [...] He was only gradually led to attack on principle the gods of Mecca. [...] Meccan merchants then discovered that a religious revolution might be dangerous to their fairs and their trade." F.&amp;nbsp;Buhl &amp; A.T.&amp;nbsp;Welch, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Muhammad", vol.&amp;nbsp;7, p.&amp;nbsp;364.&lt;/ref&gt; In 622, a few years after losing protection with the death of his influential uncle [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]], Muhammad [[Hegira|migrated to the city of Yathrib]] (now known as Medina). With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would [[Succession to Muhammad|succeed him as leader of the Muslim community]] during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].

By the 8th century, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] extended from [[Al-Andalus|Iberia]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east. Polities such as those ruled by the Umayyads and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (in the [[Middle East]] and later in [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Spain]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Southern Italy]]), [[Fatimids]], [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluk]]s were among the most influential powers in the world. Highly persianized empires built by the [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavid]]s, [[Ghurid]]s made significant developments. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] gave rise to many centers of culture and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]] and produced notable [[polymath]]s, [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomers]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematicians]], [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|physicians]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophers]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

By the early 13th century, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] conquered the northern [[Indian subcontinent]], while Turkic dynasties like the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and [[Artuqids]] conquered much of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. In the 13th and 14th centuries, destructive [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]] and those of [[Timur|Tamerlane]] (Timur) from the East, along with the loss of population in the [[Black Death]], greatly weakened the traditional centers of the Muslim world, stretching from [[Persia]] to [[Egypt]], but saw the emergence of the [[Timurid Renaissance]] and major global economic powers such as [[West Africa]]'s [[Mali Empire]] and [[South Asia]]'s [[Bengal Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, J.

Nonetheless, in the [[Early Modern period]], the states of the [[Age of the Islamic Gunpowders]]—the [[Ottomans|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Safavids|Safavid Iran]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]]—emerged as great world powers.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] fell under the influence or direct control of [[Europe]]an "[[Great Powers]]." Their efforts to win independence and build modern nation-states over the course of the last two centuries continue to reverberate to the present day, as well as fuel conflict-zones in regions such as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]], [[Xinjiang conflict|Xinjiang]], [[Chechnya]], [[Central African Republic|Central Africa]], [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]] and [[Rohingya genocide|Myanmar]].

=== Background ===
{{main articles|Abraham in Islam}}
[[File:020813-AAO.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaaba]] and the [[Maqam Ibrahim]], where the foot-prints of Ibrahim ([[Abraham]]) miraculously rested.]]
Islam being an Abrahamic religion traces back to Abraham and his first-born son [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]] (while Christianity and Judaism traces back to his second-born son [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]]). According to the tradition, Abraham find god himself and accepts all sacrifices for him, he also rebuilt the [[Kaaba]] the holiest place of the faith with his son, after the first prophet Adam.

=== Prophethood of Muhammad ===
{{main article|Muhammad in Islam}}
[[Image:Cave Hira.jpg|thumb|The Cave of Hira, from where Muhammad received his first revelation of the [[Qur'an]].]]
Islam starts in about the 7th century (CE) when Muhammad revealed that "[[Tawhid|God is One]]" and that he is a prophet.

The main sources of information regarding Muhammad' life and teachings is Qur'an, According to the Qur'an, Muhammad was last and the final messenger of all mankind ([[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]), who was sent by God to preach the [[monotheistic]] teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.

==Timeline==
{{Main|Timeline of Islamic history}}

The following timeline can serve as a rough visual guide to the most important polities in the Islamic world prior to the [[First World War]]. It covers major historical centers of power and culture, including [[Arabia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]), [[Levant]] (modern [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Palestine (region)|Israel/Palestine]]), [[Egypt]], [[Maghreb]] (north-west Africa), [[al-Andalus]] ([[Iberia]]), [[Transoxania]] ([[Central Asia]]), [[Hindustan]] (including modern [[Pakistan]], [[North India]] and [[Bangladesh]]), and [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]). It is necessarily an approximation, since rule over some regions was sometimes divided among different centers of power, and authority in larger polities was often distributed among several dynasties. For example, during the later stages of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], even the capital city of [[Baghdad]] was effectively ruled by other dynasties such as the [[Buyyids]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]], while the [[Ottomans]] commonly delegated executive authority over outlying provinces to local potentates, such as the [[Dey]]s of Algiers, the [[Beys of Tunis]], and the [[Mamluks of Iraq]].

==Early sources and historiography ==
{{main|Historiography of early Islam}}

The study of the earliest periods in Islamic history is made difficult by a lack of sources.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=628}} For example, the most important historiographical source for the origins of Islam is the work of [[al-Tabari]].{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=6}}  While al-Tabari is considered an excellent historian by the standards of his time and place, he made liberal use of mythical, legendary, stereotyped, distorted, and polemical presentations of subject matter—which are however considered to be Islamically acceptable—and his descriptions of the beginning of Islam post-date the events by several generations, al-Tabari having died in 923.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=2}}{{sfn|Hughes|2013|p=56}}

Differing views about how to deal with the available sources has led to the development of four different approaches to the history of early Islam.  All four methods have some level of support today.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=633}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvnb|Hughes|2013|pp=6 &amp; 7}}, who links the practice of source and tradition (or [[form criticism|form]]) criticism as one approach.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The ''descriptive'' method uses the outlines of Islamic traditions, while being adjusted for the stories of miracles and faith-centred claims within those sources.{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=629, 633}} [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[Gustav Weil]] represent some of the first historians following the descriptive method.  
*On the ''[[source criticism|source critical]]'' method, a comparison of all the sources is sought in order to identify which informants to the sources are weak and thereby distinguish spurious material.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=630}}  The work of [[William Montgomery Watt]] and that of [[Wilferd Madelung]] are two source critical examples.  
*On the ''[[tradition criticism|tradition critical]]'' method, the sources are believed to be based on oral traditions with unclear origins and transmission history, and so are treated very cautiously.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=631}} [[Ignaz Goldziher]] was the pioneer of the tradition critical method, and [[Uri Rubin]] gives a contemporary example.  
*The ''[[Revisionist school of Islamic studies|skeptical]]'' method doubts nearly all of the material in the traditional sources, regarding any possible historical core as too difficult to decipher from distorted and fabricated material.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=632}}  An early example of the sceptical method was the work of [[John Wansbrough]].

Nowadays, the popularity of the different methods employed varies on the scope of the works under consideration. For overview treatments of the history of early Islam, the descriptive approach is more popular.  For scholars who look at the beginnings of Islam in depth, the source critical and tradition critical methods are more often followed.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=633}}

After the 8th century, the quality of sources improves.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=9}}  Those sources which treated earlier times with a large temporal and cultural gap now begin to give accounts which are more contemporaneous, the quality of genre of available historical accounts improves, and new documentary sources—such as official documents, correspondence and poetry—appear.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=9}} For the time prior to the beginning of Islam—in the 6th century—sources are superior as well, if still of mixed quality. In particular, the sources covering the [[Sasanian]] realm of influence in the 6th century are poor, while the sources for Byzantine areas at the time are of a respectable quality, and complemented by [[Syriac Christian]] sources for Syria and Iraq.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|pp=4, 5}}

==Early period==

Islam arose within the context of [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p= 9}} The second half of the sixth century saw political disorder in Arabia, and communication routes were no longer secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Christian Julien Robin|title= Arabia and Ethiopia.

According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570.&lt;ref&gt;"The very first question a biographer has to ask, namely when the person was born, cannot be answered precisely for Muhammad. [...] Muhammad's biographers usually make him 40 or sometimes 43 years old at the time of his call to be a prophet, which [...] would put the year of his birth at about 570 A.D."

Most likely Muhammad was "intimately aware of Jewish belief and practices," and acquainted with the ''Hanif''.{{sfn|Rogerson|2010}}{{sfn|Hazleton|2013|p="a sense of kinship"}} Like the ''Hanif'', Muhammad practiced ''[[Taḥannuth]]'', spending time in seclusion at mount Hira and "turning away from paganism."{{sfn|Bleeker|1968|p=32-34}}&lt;ref&gt;Sally Mallam, [https://humanjourney.us/ideas-that-shaped-our-modern-world-section/mohammad-and-the-beginnings-of-islam-community-of-believers/ ''The Community of Believers'']&lt;/ref&gt; When he was about forty years old he began receiving at mount Hira' what Muslims regard as divine revelations delivered through the angel [[Gabriel]], which would later form the [[Quran]].

==Rashidun Caliphate==
{{Main|Rashidun Caliphate}}

[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|The Rashidun caliphate]]

After Muhammad died, a series of four Caliphs governed the Islamic state: [[Abu Bakr]] (632–634), [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (Umar І, 634–644), [[Uthman ibn Affan]], (644–656), and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] (656–661).  These leaders are known as the "[[Rashidun]]" or "rightly guided" Caliphs in [[Sunni Islam]]. They oversaw the initial phase of the [[Muslim conquests]], advancing through [[Persia]], [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], and [[North Africa]].

After Muhammad's death, [[Abu Bakr]], one of his closest associates, was chosen as the first [[caliph]] ({{lang-ar|خَليفة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|khalīfah}}'', lit. successor). Although the office of caliph retained an aura of religious authority, it laid no claim to prophecy.&lt;ref name="Hourani22"/&gt; A number of tribal leaders refused to extend agreements made with Muhammad to Abu Bakr, ceasing payments of the alms levy and in some cases claiming to be prophets in their own right.&lt;ref name="Hourani22"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Hourani|title=A History of the Arab Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=22–23|isbn=9780674010178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Bakr asserted his authority in a successful military campaign known as the [[Ridda wars]], whose momentum was carried into the lands of the [[Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;"The immediate outcome of the Muslim victories was turmoil. Medina's victories led allied tribes to attack the non-aligned to compensate for their own losses. The pressure drove tribes [...] across the imperial frontiers. The Bakr tribe, which had defeated a Persian detachment in 606, joined forces with the Muslims and led them on a raid in southern Iraq [...] A similar spilling over of tribal raiding occurred on the Syrian frontiers. Abu Bakr encouraged these movements [...] What began as inter-tribal skirmishing to consolidate a political confederation in Arabia ended as a full-scale war against the two empires."{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2002|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the reign of the second caliph, Umar I, Arab armies, whose battle-hardened ranks were now swelled by the defeated rebels&lt;ref&gt;"In dealing with captured leaders Abu Bakr showed great clemency, and many became active supporters of the cause of Islam." W.&amp;nbsp;Montgomery Watt, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed.'', "Abu Bakr", vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;110. "Umar's subsequent decision (reversing the exclusionary policy of Abu Bakr) to allow those tribes which had rebelled during the course of the Ridda wars and been subdued to participate in the expanding incursions into and attacks on the Fertile Crescent [...] incorporated the defeated Arabs into the polity as Muslims." {{Harvtxt|Berkey|2003|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former imperial auxiliary troops,&lt;ref&gt;[N]on-Muslim sources allow us to perceive an additional advantage, namely, that Arabs had been serving in the armies of Byzantium and Persia long before Islam; they had acquired valuable training in the weaponry and military tactics of the empires and had become to some degree acculturated to their ways. In fact, these sources hint that we should view many in Muhammad’s west Arabian coalition, its settled members as well as its nomads, not so much as outsiders seeking to despoil the empires but as insiders trying to grab a share of the wealth of their imperial masters.{{Harvtxt|Hoyland|2014|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; conquered the Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt, while the Sassanids [[Muslim conquest of Persia#Conquest of Mesopotamia .28636.E2.80.93638.29|lost their western territories]], with the rest to follow [[Muslim conquest of Persia#Conquest of Persia .28642.E2.80.93651.29|soon afterwards]].&lt;ref name="Hourani22"/&gt;

Umar improved administration of the fledgling empire, ordering improvement of irrigation networks and playing a role in foundation of cities like [[Basra]]. To be close to the poor, he lived in a simple mud hut without doors and walked the streets every evening.

Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, who lived as religious minorities and were taxed (while Muslims paid "Zakat") to finance the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann (2007), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; As new areas were conquered, they also benefited from free trade with other areas of the growing Islamic state, where, to encourage commerce, taxes were applied to wealth rather than trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam: An Illustrated History'' by Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville, Stuart Christopher Munro-Hay p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslims paid [[Zakat]] on their wealth for the benefit of the poor.

When Umar was assassinated in 644, [[Uthman ibn Affan]] second cousin and twice son-in-law of Muhammad became the next caliph. As the Arabic language is written without vowels, speakers of different Arabic dialects and other languages recited the Quran with phonetic variations that could alter the meaning of the text. When Uthman ibn Affan became aware of this, he ordered a standard copy of the Quran to be prepared. Begun during his reign, the [[History of the Quran|compilation of the Quran]] was finished some time between 650 and 656, and copies were sent out to the different centers of the expanding Islamic empire.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie; Barbar Rivolta (Summer, 1992).

After Muhammad's death, the old tribal differences between the Arabs started to resurface. Following the [[Roman–Persian Wars]] and the [[Byzantine–Sassanid Wars]] deep-rooted differences between Iraq (formerly under the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]]) and Syria (formerly under the [[Byzantine Empire]]) also existed. Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area.&lt;ref&gt;''Iraq a Complicated State: Iraq's Freedom War'' by Karim M. S. Al-Zubaidi p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Uthman ibn Affan]] became very old, [[Marwan I]], a relative of Muawiyah, slipped into the vacuum, becoming his secretary and slowly assuming more control. When Uthman was assassinated in 656, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, assumed the position of caliph and moved the capital to Kufa in Iraq. Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria, and Marwan I demanded arrest of the culprits. Marwan I manipulated every one and created conflict, which resulted in the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] (the "First Fitna"). Ali was assassinated by [[Kharijites]] in 661. Six months later in 661, in the interest of peace, Ali's son [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], made a peace treaty with Muawiyah I. In the [[Hasan–Muawiya treaty]], Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he would be just to the people and not establish a dynasty after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilferd Madelung|title=The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64696-3|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_3_49.php|title=Sahih Bukhari : Book of "Peacemaking"|first=Sahih|last=Bukhari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muawiyah subsequently broke the conditions of the agreement and established the [[Umayyad dynasty]], with a capital in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Holt|1977a|pp=67–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Husayn ibn Ali]], by then Muhammad's only living grandson, refused to swear allegiance to the Umayyads.

==Umayyad Caliphate==
{{main|Umayyad Caliphate}}
[[File:Umayyad750ADloc.png|thumb|The Umayyad caliphate]]

The Umayyad dynasty (or ''Ommiads''), whose name derives from [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams]], the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph, ruled from 661 to 750. Although the Umayyad family came from the city of [[Mecca]], [[Damascus]] was the capital. After the death of [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]] in 666,&lt;ref&gt;''The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate'' by Wilferd Madelung. p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedic ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia: A-I'', Volume 1 edited by R. Khanam. p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muawiyah I]] consolidated his power. Muawiyah I moved his capital to Damascus from [[Medina]], which led to profound changes in the empire. In the same way, at a later date, the transfer of the Caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad marked the accession of a new family to power.

As the state grew, the state expenses increased. Additionally the [[Bayt al-mal]] and the Welfare State expenses to assist the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled, increased, the Umayyads asked the new converts (mawali) to continue paying the poll tax. The Umayyad rule, with its wealth and luxury also seemed at odds with the Islamic message preached by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Politics'' John L. Esposito 1998 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Imperial Law: Harun-Al-Rashid's Codification Project'' by Benjamin Jokisch - 2007 p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Byzantine And Early Islamic Near East'' Hugh N. Kennedy - 2006 p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; All this increased discontent.&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronology of Islamic History'' by H. U. Rahman pp. 106, 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Voyages in World History'' by Josef W. Meri p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] rallied discontented ''mawali'', poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them with the help of the general [[Abu Muslim]], inaugurating the [[Abbasid dynasty]] in 750, which moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2002|p=56}}; {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1993|pp=71–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of the [[Ummayad]] family fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], which lasted until 1031 before falling due to the [[Fitna of al-Andalus]]. The Bayt al-mal, the Welfare State then continued under the Abbasids.

At its largest extent, the Umayyad dynasty covered more than {{convert|5000000|sqmi}} making it one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] the world had yet seen,&lt;ref name=Blankinship&gt;{{Cite book|title=The End of the Jihad State, the Reign of Hisham Ibn 'Abd-al Malik and the collapse of the Umayyads|first=Khalid Yahya|last=Blankinship|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-7914-1827-7|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fifth [[List of largest empires#Contiguous empires|largest contiguous empire]] ever.

Muawiyah beautified Damascus, and developed a court to rival that of [[Constantinople]].

According to Shi'a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali.
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba]] (Great Mosque of Kairouan), founded by the Umayyad general Uqba Ibn Nafi in 670, is the oldest and most prestigious mosque in the Muslim West; its present form dates from the 9th century, [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]In 682, Yazid restored [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] as the governor of North Africa. Uqba won battles against the [[Berber people|Berbers]] and Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Arab by Philip K Hitti&lt;/ref&gt; From there Uqba marched thousands of miles westward towards [[Tangier]], where he reached the Atlantic coast, and then marched eastwards through the [[Atlas Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Islam by prof.Masudul Hasan&lt;/ref&gt; With about 300 [[cavalry]]men, he proceeded towards Biskra where he was ambushed by a Berber force under Kaisala.

Under the rule of [[Yazid I]], some Muslims in Kufa began to think that if [[Husayn ibn Ali]] the descendant of Muhammad was their ruler, he would have been more just. He was invited to Kufa but was later betrayed and killed. Imam Husain's son, Imam [[Ali ibn Husain]], was imprisoned along with Husain's sister and other ladies left in [[Karbala]] war. Due to opposition by public they were later released and allowed to go to their native place Medina. One Imam after another continued in the generation of Imam Husain but they were opposed by the Caliphs of the day as their rivals till Imam [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]] came in power as first Caliph of [[Fatimid]] in North Africa when Caliphate and Imamate came to same person again after Imam Ali. These Imams were recognized by Shia Islam taking Imam Ali as first Caliph/ Imam and the same is institutionalized by the [[Safavids]] and many similar institutions named now as [[Ismaili]], [[Twelver]] etc.

The period under [[Muawiya II]] was marked by civil wars ([[Second Fitna]]). This would ease in the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], a well-educated and capable ruler. Despite the many political problems that impeded his rule, all important records were translated into Arabic. In his reign, a [[currency]] for the Muslim world was minted. This led to war with the Byzantine Empire under [[Justinian II]] ([[Battle of Sebastopolis]]) in 692 in [[Asia Minor]]. The Byzantines were decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of [[Slavs]]. The Islamic currency was then made the exclusive currency in the Muslim world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He reformed agriculture and commerce.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular [[postal service]].
[[File:The Saracen Army outside Paris, 730-32 AD.png|thumb|Umayyad army invades France after conquering the Iberian Peninsula]] [[Al-Walid I]] began the next stage of Islamic conquests. Under him the early Islamic empire reached its farthest extent. He reconquered parts of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire and moved on into [[Carthage]] and across to the west of North Africa. Muslim armies under [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began to [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquer the Iberian Peninsula]] using North African [[Berber people|Berber]] armies. The [[Visigoths]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] were defeated when the Umayyad conquered [[Lisbon]]. The Iberian Peninsula was the farthest extent of Islamic control of Europe (they were stopped at the [[Battle of Tours]]). In the east, Islamic armies under [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] made it as far as the [[Indus Valley]]. Under Al-Walid, the caliphate empire stretched from the Iberian Peninsula to India. [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] played a crucial role in the organization and selection of military commanders. Al-Walid paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the Umayyad era., This tactic was crucial for the expansion to the Iberian Peninsula. His reign is considered to be the apex of Islamic power.

[[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] was hailed as caliph the day al-Walid died. He appointed [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]] governor of [[Mesopotamia]]. Sulayman ordered the arrest and execution of the family of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], one of two prominent leaders (the other was [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]]) who had supported the succession of al-Walid's son Yazid, rather than Sulayman. Al-Hajjaj had predeceased al-Walid, so he posed no threat. Qutaibah renounced allegiance to Sulayman, though his troops rejected his appeal to revolt. They killed him and sent his head to Sulayman. Sulayman did not move to [[Damascus]] on becoming Caliph, remaining in [[Ramla]]. Sulayman sent [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] to attack the Byzantine capital ([[Siege of Constantinople (717–18)|siege of Constantinople]]). The intervention of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] on the Byzantine side proved decisive. The Muslims sustained heavy losses. Sulayman died suddenly in 717.

[[Yazid II]] came to power on the death of Umar II. Yazid fought the Kharijites, with whom Umar had been negotiating, and killed the Kharijite leader Shawdhab. In Yazid's reign, civil wars began in different parts of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;In the Al-Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula), North Africa and in the east populations revolted. In A.H. 102 (720–721) in Ifriqiyah, the harsh governor Yazid ibn Muslim was overthrown and Muhammad ibn Yazid, the former governor, restored to power. The caliph accepted this and confirmed Muhammad ibn Yazid as governor of Ifriqiyah.&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid expanded the Caliphate's territory into the Caucasus, before dying in 724. Inheriting the caliphate from his brother, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ruled an empire with many problems. He was effective in addressing these problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long rule was an effective one, and renewed reforms introduced by Umar II. Under Hisham's rule, regular raids against the Byzantines continued. In North Africa, Kharijite teachings combined with local restlessness to produce the [[Berber Revolt]]. He was also faced with a revolt by [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. Hisham suppressed both revolts. The Abbasids continued to gain power in Khurasan and Iraq. However, they were not strong enough to make a move yet. Some were caught and punished or executed by eastern governors. The [[Battle of Akroinon]], a decisive Byzantine victory, was during the final campaign of the Umayyad dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;*Eggenberger, David (1985). ''An Encyclopedia of Battles: Accounts of Over 1,560 Battles from 1479 BC. to the Present''. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-24913-1}} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hisham died in 743.

[[Al-Walid II]] saw political intrigue during his reign. [[Yazid III]] spoke out against his cousin Walid's "immorality" which included discrimination on behalf of the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis]] and [[Mawali|non-Arab Muslims]], and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji'iya (believers in human [[free will]]).&lt;ref&gt;von Ess, "Kadar", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Walid was shortly thereafter deposed in a [[coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophilus. Quoted Robert Hoyland, ''Seeing Islam as Others Saw It'' (Darwin Press, 1998), 660&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid disbursed funds from the treasury and acceded to the Caliph. He explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the [[Quran|Book of God]] and the Sunna. Yazid reigned for only six months, while various groups refused allegiance and dissident movements arose, after which he died. [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid]], named heir apparent by his brother Yazid III, ruled for a short time in 744, before he abdicated. [[Marwan II]] ruled from 744 until he was killed in 750. He was the last Umayyad ruler to rule from Damascus. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah and Abdallah heirs. He appointed governors and asserted his authority by force. Anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. His death signalled the end of Umayyad rule in the East, and was followed by the massacre of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the talented prince [[Abd al-Rahman I|Abd al-Rahman]] who escaped to the Iberian Peninsula and founded a dynasty there.

[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|Abbasid caliphate]]
The [[Abbasid]] dynasty rose to power in 750, consolidating the gains of the earlier [[Caliphate]]s. Initially, they conquered [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]] including the [[Balearics]] and, after, in 827 the [[Islamic Southern Italy|Southern Italy]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Islam"&gt;J. Jomier. Islam: Encyclopaedia of Islam Online. accessdate=2007-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ruling party]] had come to power on the wave of dissatisfaction with the Umayyads, cultivated by the Abbasid revolutionary [[Abu Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1993|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1977a|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Abbasids Islamic civilization flourished. Most notable was the development of Arabic [[Arabic literature|prose]] and [[Arabic poetry|poetry]], termed by ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' as its "[[Golden Age of Islam|golden age]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1977b|pp=661–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commerce and industry (considered a [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution]]) and the [[Islamic arts|arts]] and sciences (considered a [[Islamic science|Muslim Scientific Revolution]]) also prospered under Abbasid caliphs [[al-Mansur]] (ruled 754–775), [[Harun al-Rashid]] (ruled 786–809), [[al-Ma'mun]] (ruled 809–813) and their immediate successors.&lt;ref name="B.a-d"&gt;"Abbasid Dynasty", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital was moved from Damascus to [[Baghdad]], due to the importance placed by the Abbasids upon eastern affairs in [[Persia]] and [[Transoxania]].&lt;ref name="B.a-d" /&gt; At this time the caliphate showed signs of fracture amid the rise of regional dynasties. Although the Umayyad family had been killed by the revolting Abbasids, one family member, [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], escaped to Spain and established an independent caliphate there in 756. In the [[Maghreb]], Harun al-Rashid appointed the Arab [[Aghlabid]]s as virtually autonomous rulers, although they continued to recognize central authority. Aghlabid rule was short-lived, and they were deposed by the [[Shiite]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty in 909. By around 960, the Fatimids had conquered Abbasid Egypt, building a capital there in 973 called "''al-Qahirah''" (meaning "the planet of victory", known today as [[Cairo]]). In Persia the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Ghaznavid]]s snatched power from the Abbasids.&lt;ref name="B-I"&gt;"Islam", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AHGC"/&gt; Abbasid influence had been consumed by the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] (a Muslim Turkish clan which had migrated into mainland Persia) by 1055.&lt;ref name="B.a-d" /&gt;

Expansion continued, sometimes by force, sometimes by peaceful [[Dawah|proselytising]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Islam"/&gt; The first stage in the [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent|conquest of India]] began just before the year 1000. By some 200 (from 1193 to 1209) years later, the area up to the [[Ganges river]] had fallen. In sub-Saharan West Africa, Islam was established just after the year 1000. Muslim rulers were in [[Kanem Region|Kanem]] starting from sometime between 1081 and 1097, with reports of a Muslim prince at the head of [[Gao]] as early as 1009. The [[Mali Empire|Islamic kingdoms associated with Mali]] reached prominence in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Islam". Encyclopaedia of Islam Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbasids developed initiatives aimed at greater Islamic unity. Different sects of the Islamic faith and mosques, separated by doctrine, history, and practice, were pushed to cooperate. The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking the Umayyads' moral character and administration. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], "The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of Marw with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the [[kinship]]-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. Islamic [[ecumenism]], promoted by the Abbasids, refers to the idea of unity of the ''[[Ummah]]'' in the literal meaning: that there was a single faith. Islamic philosophy developed as the [[Shariah]] was codified, and the four [[Madhabs]] were established. This era also saw the rise of classical [[Sufism]]. Religious achievements included completion of the canonical collections of [[Hadith]] of [[Sahih Bukhari]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam recognized to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the Quran identifying [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], and "[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]" or "baptists" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandean]]s and related Mesopotamian groups) as "[[people of the book]]". Toward the beginning of the high Middle Ages, the doctrines of the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]], two major [[Islamic schools and branches|denominations of Islam]], solidified and the [[divisions of the world in Islam|divisions of the world]] theologically would form. These trends would continue into the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods.

Politically, the Abbasid Caliphate evolved into an Islamic [[monarchy]] ([[unitary state|unitary system of government]].) The regional [[Sultanate]] and [[Emirate]] governors' existence, validity, or legality were acknowledged for unity of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khaddūrī|2002|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early Islamic philosophy]] of the [[#Berbers and Iberian Umayyads|Iberian Umayyads]], [[Averroes]] presented an argument in ''The Decisive Treatise'', providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official [[Ash'ari]] theology; thus, [[Averroism]] has been considered a precursor to modern [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Wahab El Messeri.

According to Arab sources in the year 750, [[Al-Saffah]], the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, launched a massive rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate from the province of Khurasan near Talas. After eliminating the entire Umayyad family and achieving victory at the [[Battle of the Zab]], Al-Saffah and his forces marched into Damascus and founded a new dynasty. His forces confronted many regional powers and consolidated the realm of the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;for more, see [[As-Saffah#As-Saffah.27s Caliphate|As-Saffah's_Caliphate]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|An Arabic manuscript written under the second half of the Abbasid Era.]]
In [[Al-Mansur]]'s time, Persian scholarship emerged. Many non-Arabs converted to Islam. The Umayyads actively discouraged conversion in order to continue the collection of the jizya, or the tax on non-Muslims. Islam nearly doubled within its territory from 8% of residents in 750 to 15% by the end of Al-Mansur's reign. [[Al-Mahdi]], whose name means "Rightly-guided" or "Redeemer", was proclaimed caliph when his father was on his deathbed. Baghdad blossomed during Al-Mahdi's reign, becoming the world's largest city. It attracted immigrants from Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia and as far away as India and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. Like his father, [[Al-Hadi]]&lt;ref&gt;An universal history: from the earliest accounts to the present time, Volume 2 By George Sale, George Psalmanazar, Archibald Bower, George Shelvocke, John Campbell, John Swinton.

He was considered an "enlightened ruler", and continued the policies of his Abbasid predecessors. His short rule was plagued by military conflicts and internal intrigue.

The military conflicts subsided as [[Harun al-Rashid]] ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Chamber's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge, Volume 5. W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1890. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WlYWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA567 p. 567].&lt;/ref&gt; His reign was marked by scientific, cultural and religious prosperity. He established the library [[Bayt al-Hikma]] ("House of Wisdom"), and the arts and music flourished during his reign. The [[Barmakid]] family played a decisive advisorial role in establishing the Caliphate, but declined during Rashid's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes P. Schadé (ed.). Encyclopedia of World Religions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Amin]] received the Caliphate from his father Harun Al-Rashid, but failed to respect the arrangements made for his brothers, leading to the [[Fourth Fitna]]. [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s general [[Tahir ibn Husayn]] [[Siege of Baghdad (812–813)|took Baghdad]], executing Al-Amin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] History volume xxxi, "The War Between Brothers," transl. Michael Fishbein, SUNY, Albany, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The war led to a loss of prestige for the dynasty.

==== Rise of regional powers ====
{{See|Anarchy at Samarra}}
[[File:EditedStattering.png|thumb|Regional powers born out of the fragmentation of the Abbasid caliphate]]
The Abbasids soon became caught in a three-way rivalry among [[Copt]]ic Arabs, [[Indo-Persian]]s, and immigrant Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|pp=121–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the cost of running a large empire became too great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lapidus|1988|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks, Egyptians, and Arabs adhered to the Sunnite sect; the Persians, a great portion of the Turkic groups, and several of the princes in India were Shia. The political unity of Islam began to disintegrate. Under the influence of the Abbasid caliphs, independent dynasties appeared in the Muslim world and the caliphs recognized such dynasties as legitimately Muslim. The first was the [[Tahirid dynasty]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which was founded during the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s reign. Similar dynasties included the [[Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]] and [[Seljuqs]]. During this time, advancements were made in the areas of astronomy, poetry, philosophy, science, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Spencer Baynes|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtpTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA578|year=1878|publisher=A. and C.

Upon Al-Amin's death, [[Al-Ma'mun]] became Caliph. Al-Ma'mun extended the Abbasid empire's territory during his reign and dealt with rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu rebellions in Sindh were put down, and most of Afghanistan was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of Kabul. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan. There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of Al-Ma'mun's reign. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sindh was rebellious, but Ghassan ibn Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for Al-Ma'mun was the uprising headed by Babak Khorramdin. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army, killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor of his military services in order to assure his loyalty. Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became powerful, frustrating Al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the [[Tahirid dynasty]] became a threat as Al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and other opponents.

Al-Ma'mun worked to centralize power and ensure a smooth succession. Al-Mahdi proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy. Religious scholars averred that Al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the ''[[Mihna]]'', the [[Abbasid inquisition]] which he introduced in 833 four months before he died.&lt;ref&gt;The Mihna subjected traditionalist scholars with social influence and intellectual quality to imprisonment, religious tests, and loyalty oaths. Al-Ma'mun introduced the Mihna with the intention to centralize religious power in the caliphal institution and test the loyalty of his subjects. The Mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the state of the creation of the Qur'an: if the person interrogated stated he believed the Qur'an to be created, he was free to leave and continue his profession.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ulama]]'' emerged as a force in Islamic politics during Al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the inquisitions. The ''Ulema'' and the major Islamic law schools took shape in the period of Al-Ma'mun. In parallel, Sunnism became defined as a religion of laws. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam became more pronounced.

During the Al-Ma'mun regime, [[List of border conflicts|border war]]s increased. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died while leading an expedition in [[Sardis]]. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated well and with tolerance. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Had he been victorious over the Byzantine Emperor, Al-Ma'mun would have made a condition of peace be that the emperor hand over of a copy of the "Almagest".&lt;/ref&gt; His scientists originated [[alchemy]]. Shortly before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the breaching of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] to search for knowledge and treasure. Workers tunnelled in near where tradition located the original entrance. Al-Ma'mun later died near Tarsus under questionable circumstances and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Al-Mu'tasim]], rather than his son, Al-Abbas ibn Al-Ma'mun.

As Caliph, Al-Mu'tasim promptly ordered the dismantling of al-Ma'mun's military base at Tyana. He faced Khurramite revolts. One of the most difficult problems facing this Caliph was the ongoing uprising of Babak Khorramdin. Al-Mu'tasim overcame the rebels and secured a significant victory. [[Theophilos (emperor)|Byzantine emperor Theophilus]] launched an attack against Abbasid fortresses. Al-Mu'tasim sent Al-Afshin, who met and defeated Theophilus' forces at the [[Battle of Anzen]]. On his return he became aware of a serious military conspiracy which forced him and his successors to rely upon Turkish commanders and [[ghilman]] slave-soldiers (foreshadowing the [[Mamluk]] system). The Khurramiyyah were never fully suppressed, although they slowly declined during the reigns of succeeding Caliphs. Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there was an uprising in Palestine, but he defeated the rebels.

During Al-Mu'tasim's reign, the Tahirid dynasty continued to grow in power. The Tahirids were exempted from many tribute and oversight functions. Their independence contributed to Abbasid decline in the east. Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed his half-brother al-Ma'mun. He continued his predecessor's support for the Islamic Mu'tazila sect, applying brutal torture against the opposition. Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] was employed by Al-Mu'tasim and tutored the Caliph's son. Al-Kindi had served at the House of Wisdom and continued his studies in Greek geometry and algebra under the caliph's patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, History v. 32 "The Reunification of the Abbasid Caliphate," SUNY, Albany, 1987; v. 33 "Storm and Stress along the Northern frontiers of the Abbasid Caliphate," transl. C.E. Bosworth, SUNY, Albany, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Wathiq]] succeeded his father. Al-Wathiq dealt with opposition in Arabia, Syria, Palestine and in Baghdad. Using a famous sword he personally joined the execution of the Baghdad rebels. The revolts were the result of an increasingly large gap between Arab populations and the Turkish armies. The revolts were put down, but antagonism between the two groups grew, as Turkish forces gained power. He also secured a captive exchange with the Byzantines. Al-Wathiq was a patron of scholars, as well as artists. He personally had musical talent and is reputed to have composed over one hundred songs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] History v. 34 "Incipient Decline," transl. Joel L. Kramer, SUNY, Albany, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88706-875-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Samarra.jpg|thumb|[[Malwiya|Minaret]] at the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]].]]
When Al-Wathiq died of high fever, [[Al-Mutawakkil]] succeeded him. Al-Mutawakkil's reign is remembered for many reforms and is viewed as a golden age. He was the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty fell into decline. Al-Mutawakkil ended the Mihna. Al-Mutawakkil built the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]&lt;ref&gt;Its minarets were spiraling cones {{convert|55|m|ft}} high with a spiral ramp, and it had 17 aisles with walls paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. During his reign, Al-Mutawakkil met famous Byzantine theologian [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine the Philosopher]], who was sent to strengthen diplomatic relations between the Empire and the Caliphate by [[Michael III|Emperor Michael III]]. Al-Mutawakkil involved himself in religious debates, as reflected in his actions against minorities. The Shīʻi faced repression embodied in the destruction of the [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine of Hussayn ibn ʻAlī]], an action that was ostensibly carried out to stop pilgrimages. Al-Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkish statesmen and slave soldiers to put down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably capturing Sicily from the Byzantines. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a Turkish soldier.

[[Al-Muntasir]] succeeded to the Caliphate on the same day with the support of the Turkish faction, though he was implicated in the murder. The Turkish party had al-Muntasir remove his brothers from the line of succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. Both brothers wrote statements of abdication. During his reign, Al-Muntasir removed the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn and sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines. Al-Muntasir died of unknown causes. The Turkish chiefs held a council to select his successor, electing [[Al-Musta'in]]. The Arabs and western troops from Baghdad were displeased at the choice and attacked. However, the Caliphate no longer depended on Arabian choice, but depended on Turkish support. After the failed Muslim campaign against the Christians, people blamed the Turks for bringing disaster on the faith and murdering their Caliphs. After the Turks besieged Baghdad, Al-Musta'in planned to abdicate to [[Al-Mu'tazz]] but was put to death by his order. Al-Mu'tazz was enthroned by the Turks, becoming the youngest Abbasaid Caliph to assume power.

Al-Mu'tazz proved too apt a pupil of his Turkish masters, but was surrounded by parties jealous of each other. At [[Samarra]], the Turks were having problems with the "Westerns" (Berbers and [[Moor (people)|Moor]]s), while the Arabs and Persians at Baghdad, who had supported al-Musta'in, regarded both with equal hatred. Al-Mu'tazz put his brothers Al-Mu'eiyyad and Abu Ahmed to death. The ruler spent recklessly, causing a revolt of Turks, Africans, and Persians for their pay. Al-Mu'tazz was brutally deposed shortly thereafter. [[Al-Muhtadi]] became the next Caliph. He was firm and virtuous compared to the earlier Caliphs, though the Turks held the power. The Turks killed him soon after his ascension. [[Al-Mu'tamid]] followed, holding on for 23 years, though he was largely a ruler in name only. After the [[Zanj Rebellion]], Al-Mu'tamid summoned [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|al-Muwaffak]] to help him. Thereafter, Al-Muwaffaq ruled in all but name. The [[Hamdanid dynasty]] was founded by [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]] when he was appointed governor of [[Mardin]] in Anatolia by the Caliphs in 890. Al-Mu'tamid later transferred authority to his son, [[al-Mu'tadid]], and never regained power. The [[Tulunids]] became the first independent state in Islamic Egypt, when they broke away during this time.

Al-Mu'tadid ably administered the Caliphate. Egypt returned to allegiance and Mesopotamia was restored to order. He was tolerant towards Shi'i, but toward the Umayyad community he was not so just. Al-Mu'tadid was cruel in his punishments, some of which are not surpassed by those of his predecessors. For example, the Kharijite leader at Mosul was paraded about Baghdad clothed in a robe of silk, of which Kharijites denounced as sinful, and then crucified. Upon Al-Mu'tadid's death, his son by a Turkish slave-girl, [[Al-Muktafi]], succeeded to the throne.

Al-Muktafi became a favourite of the people for his generosity, and for abolishing his father's secret prisons, the terror of Baghdad. During his reign, the Caliphate overcame threats such as the [[Carmathians]]. &lt;!-- prevailed more or less with the Byzantines, who were not slow to take advantage of the Caliphate's difficulties.what does this mean? hostilities do not prevail. one or the other combatants might. "War was kept up with various fortune on both sides." Did the fortunes fund the war or did both sides have success?--&gt; Upon Al-Muktafi's death, the vazir next chose [[Al-Muqtadir]]. Al-Muqtadir's reign was a constant succession of thirteen Vazirs, one rising on the fall or assassination of another. His long reign brought the Empire to its lowest ebb. Africa was lost, and Egypt nearly. Mosul threw off its dependence, and the Greeks raided across the undefended border. The East continued to formally recognize the Caliphate, including those who virtually claimed independence.

At the end of the Early Baghdad Abbasids period, Empress [[Zoe Karbonopsina]] pressed for an armistice with Al-Muqtadir and arranged for the ransom of the Muslim prisoner&lt;ref&gt;A sum of 120,000 golden pieces was paid for the freedom of the captives.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Byzantine frontier was threatened by Bulgarians. This only added to Baghdad's disorder. Though despised by the people, Al-Muqtadir was again placed in power after upheavals. Al-Muqtadir was eventually slain outside the city gates, whereupon courtiers chose his brother [[al-Qahir]]. He was even worse. Refusing to abdicate, he was blinded and cast into prison.

His son [[Ar-Radi]] took over only to experience a cascade of misfortune. Praised for his piety, he became the tool of the de facto ruling Minister, [[Ibn Raik]] (''[[amir al-umara]]''; 'Amir of the Amirs'). Ibn Raik held the reins of government and his name was joined with the Caliph's in public prayers. Around this period, the [[Hanbali]]s, supported by popular sentiment, set up in fact a kind of 'Sunni inquisition'. Ar-Radi is commonly regarded as the last of the real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold assemblies, to commune with philosophers, to discuss the questions of the day, to take counsel on the affairs of State; to distribute [[Alms and Almsgiving|alms]], or to temper the severity of cruel officers. Thus ended the Early Baghdad Abbasids.

In the late mid-930s, the [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] of Egypt carried the Arabic title "Wali" reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids, The first governor ([[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid]]) was installed by the Abbasid Caliph. They gave him and his descendants the Wilayah for 30 years. The last name Ikhshid is Soghdian for "prince".

Also in the 930s, [['Imad al-Daula|'Alī ibn Būyah]] and his two younger brothers, [[Rukn al-Daula|al-Hassan]] and [[Mu'izz al-Daula|Aḥmad]] founded the [[Buyid dynasty|Būyid confederation]]. Originally a soldier in the service of the [[Ziyarids|Ziyārīds]] of [[Tabaristan|Ṭabaristān]], 'Alī was able to recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from [[Baghdad]] named Yāqūt in 934. Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of the caliphate, while accepting the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad. The Būyids made large territorial gains. [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Jibal]] were conquered. Central Iraq submitted in 945, before the Būyids took [[Kerman|Kermān]] (967), [[Oman]] (967), the [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazīra]] (979), Ṭabaristān (980), and [[Gorgan]] (981). After this the Būyids went into slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming ''de facto'' independent.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the former include the loss of [[Mosul]] in 990, and the loss of Ṭabaristān and Gurgān in 997. An example of the latter is the [[Kakuyids|Kakūyid]] dynasty of [[Isfahan|Isfahān]], whose fortunes rose with the decline of the Būyids of northern Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirham of al-Muttaqi.jpg|thumb|Dirham of Al-Muttaqi]]
At the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Caliphate had become of little importance. The ''amir al-umara'' [[Bajkam]] contented himself with dispatching his secretary to Baghdad to assemble local dignitaries to elect a successor. The choice fell on [[Al-Muttaqi]]. Bajkam was killed on a hunting party by marauding Kurds. In the ensuing anarchy in Baghdad, Ibn Raik persuaded the Caliph to flee to Mosul where he was welcomed by the Hamdanids. They assassinated Ibn Raik. Hamdanid [[Nasir al-Dawla]] advanced on Baghdad, where mercenaries and well-organised Turks repelled them. Turkish general [[Tuzun (amir al-umara)|Tuzun]] became ''amir al-umara''. The Turks were staunch Sunnis. A fresh conspiracy placed the Caliph in danger. Hamdanid troops helped ad-Daula escape to Mosul and then to Nasibin. Tuzun and the Hamdanid were stalemated. Al-Muttaqi was at [[Raqqa]], moving to Tuzun where he was deposed. Tuzun installed the blinded Caliph's cousin as successor, with the title of [[Al-Mustakfi]]. With the new Caliph, Tuzun attacked the [[Buwayhid dynasty]] and the [[Hamdanids]]. Soon after, Tuzun died, and was succeeded by one of his generals, Abu Ja'far. The Buwayhids then attacked Baghdad, and Abu Ja'far fled into hiding with the Caliph. Buwayhid Sultan Muiz ud-Daula assumed command forcing the Caliph into abject submission to the Amir. Eventually, Al-Mustakfi was blinded and deposed. The city fell into chaos, and the Caliph's palace was looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Harold | last = Bowen | title = The Life and Times of ʿAlí Ibn ʿÍsà: The Good Vizier | year = 1928 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TZM3AAAAIAAJ | page = 385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Buwayhids controlled Baghdad, [[Al-Muti]] became caliph. The office was shorn of real power and Shi'a observances were established. The Buwayhids held on Baghdad for over a century. Throughout the Buwayhid reign the Caliphate was at its lowest ebb, but was recognized religiously, except in [[Iberia]]. Buwayhid Sultan [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] was prevented from raising a Shi'a Caliph to the throne by fear for his own safety, and fear of rebellion, in the capital and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Frye (1975). The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume Four: From the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs. {{ISBN|0-521-20093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Caliph, [[Al-Ta'i]], reigned over factional strife in Syria among the Fatimids, Turks, and Carmathians. The Hideaway dynasty also fractured. The Abbasid borders were the defended only by small border states. [[Baha' al-Dawla]], the Buyid amir of Iraq, deposed al-Ta'i in 991 and proclaimed [[al-Qadir]] the new caliph.&lt;ref name=Hanne&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanne|first=Eric, J.|title=Putting the Caliph in His Place: Power, Authority, and the Late Abbasid Caliphate|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838641132|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During al-Qadir's Caliphate, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] looked after the empire. Mahmud of Ghazni, of Eastern fame, was friendly towards the Caliphs, and his victories in the Indian Empire were accordingly announced from the pulpits of Baghdad in grateful and glowing terms. Al-Qadir fostered the Sunni struggle against Shiʿism and outlawed heresies such as the [[Baghdad Manifesto]] and the doctrine that the Quran was created. He outlawed the [[Muʿtazila]], bringing an end to the development of rationalist Muslim philosophy. During this and the next period, [[Islamic literature]], especially [[Persian literature]], flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids.&lt;ref name = muir&gt;{{cite book|author-link=William Muir|first = Wiliam|last = Muir|title = The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall|date = 2000|publisher = Routledge|isbn = 9780415209014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1000, the global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 percent of the world, compared to the Christian population of 10 percent.

During [[Al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|Al-Qa'im]]'s reign, the Buwayhid ruler often fled the capital and the Seljuq dynasty gained power. [[Toghrül]] overran Syria and Armenia. He then made his way into the Capital, where he was well-received both by chiefs and people. In [[Bahrain]], the Qarmatian state collapsed in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]]. Arabia recovered from the Fatimids and again acknowledged the spiritual jurisdiction of the Abbasids. [[Al-Muqtadi]] was honoured by the Seljuq Sultan [[Malik-Shah I]], during whose reign the Caliphate was recognized throughout the extending range of Seljuq conquest. The Sultan was critical of the Caliph's interference in affairs of state, but died before deposing the last of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Riley-Smith, The Oxford History of the Crusades, (Oxford University Press, 2002), 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Late Baghdad Abbasids reigned from the beginning of the [[Crusades]] to the [[Seventh Crusade]]. The first Caliph was [[Al-Mustazhir]]. He was politically irrelevant, despite civil strife at home and the [[First Crusade]] in Syria. [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] attempted to attack Baghdad, losing at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The global Muslim population climbed to about 5 per cent as against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100. [[Jerusalem]] was captured by crusaders who massacred its inhabitants. Preachers travelled throughout the caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] from the ''[[Franks]]'' (European Crusaders). Crowds of exiles rallied for war against the [[infidel]]. Neither the Sultan nor the Caliph sent an army west.&lt;ref name="muir" /&gt;

[[Al-Mustarshid]] achieved more independence while the sultan [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq]] was engaged in war in the East. The [[Bani Assad|Banu Mazyad]] (Mazyadid State) general, [[Dubays ibn Sadaqa]]&lt;ref&gt;ʻIzz al-Dīn Ibn al-Athīr, Donald Sidney Richards, ''The chronicle of Ibn al-Athīr for the crusading period from al-Kāmil fī'l-ta'rīkh: The years 491–541/1097–1146 : the coming of the Franks and the Muslim response''.&lt;/ref&gt; (emir of [[Al-Hilla]]), plundered [[Bosra]] and attacked Baghdad together with a young brother of the sultan, [[Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud]]. Dubays was crushed by a Seljuq army under [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], founder of the [[Zengid dynasty]]. Mahmud's death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, his nephew Mas'ud and the atabeg Toghrul II. Zengi was recalled to the East, stimulated by the Caliph and Dubays, where he was beaten. The Caliph then laid siege to Mosul for three months without success, resisted by Mas'ud and Zengi. It was nonetheless a milestone in the caliphate's military revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlWsMcwZ9vEC|date= 2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96892-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the siege of Damascus (1134),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Richard, The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 1. 1979. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Zengi undertook [[Military history of the Crusader states#War with the Zengids|operations in Syria]]. Al-Mustarshid attacked sultan Mas'ud of western Seljuq and was taken prisoner. He was later found murdered.&lt;ref&gt;It is supposed by an emissary of the [[Hashshashins]], who had no love for the Caliph. Modern historians have suspected that Mas'ud instigated the murder although the two most important historians of the period Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Jawzi did not speculate on this matter.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Al-Rashid (12th century)|Al-Rashid]] failed to gain independence from Seljuq Turks. Zengi, because of the murder of Dubays, set up a rival Sultanate. Mas'ud attacked; the Caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The Sultan regained power, a council was held, the Caliph was deposed, and his uncle, son of [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|Al-Muqtafi]], appointed as the new Caliph. Ar-Rashid fled to [[Isfahan]] and was killed by Hashshashins.&lt;ref name="muir" /&gt;

Continued disunion and contests between Seljuq Turks allowed al-Muqtafi to maintain control in Baghdad and to extend it throughout Iraq. In 1139, al-Muqtafi granted protection to the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] patriarch [[Abdisho III]]. While the Crusade raged, the Caliph successfully defended Baghdad against Muhammad II of Seljuq in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1157)]]. The Sultan and the Caliph dispatched men in response to Zengi's appeal, but neither the Seljuqs, nor the Caliph, nor their Amirs, dared resist the Crusaders.

The next caliph, [[Al-Mustanjid]], saw [[Saladin]] extinguish the [[Fatimid dynasty]] after 260 years, and thus the Abbasids again prevailed. [[Al-Mustadi]] reigned when Saladin become the sultan of Egypt and declared allegiance to the Abbasids.

[[An-Nasir]], "''The Victor for the Religion of God''", attempted to restore the Caliphate to its ancient dominant role. He consistently held Iraq from Tikrit to the Gulf without interruption. His forty-seven-year reign was chiefly marked by ambitious and corrupt dealings with the Tartar chiefs, and by his hazardous invocation of the Mongols, which ended his dynasty. His son, [[Az-Zahir (Abbasid caliph)|Az-Zahir]], was Caliph for a short period before his death and An-Nasir's grandson, [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]], was made caliph.

Al-Mustansir founded the [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]]. In 1236 [[Ögedei Khan]] commanded to raise up [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]]&lt;!-- what does "to raise up" mean here?--&gt; and populated [[Herat]].

[[Al-Musta'sim]] was the last Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad and is noted for his opposition to the rise of Shajar al-Durr to the Egyptian throne during the Seventh Crusade. To the east, Mongol forces under [[Hulagu Khan]] swept through the [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad was sacked]] and the caliph deposed soon afterwards. The Mamluk sultans and Syria later appointed a powerless Abbasid Caliph in Cairo.

The Abbasid "shadow" caliph of Cairo reigned under the tutelage of the [[Mamluk]] sultans and nominal rulers used to legitimize the actual rule of the Mamluk sultans. All the Cairene Abbasid caliphs who preceded or succeeded [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|Al-Musta'in]] were spiritual heads lacking any temporal power. Al-Musta'in was the only Cairo-based Abbasid caliph to even briefly hold political power. [[Al-Mutawakkil III]] was the last "shadow" caliph.

The [[Fatimids]] originated in [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]] and eastern [[Algeria]]). The dynasty was founded in 909 by [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah|ʻAbdullāh al-Mahdī Billah]], who legitimized his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter [[Fatimah|Fātima as-Zahra]] and her husband [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|ʻAlī ibn-Abī-Tālib]], the first Shīʻa [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imām]], hence the name ''al-Fātimiyyūn'' "Fatimid".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr. A Concise History of the Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatamids and the [[Zaydis]] at the time, used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as did most Sunnis.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahmoud A.

Abdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from [[Mahdia]], his capital in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.commune-mahdia.gov.tn/ENG/presentation_ville/histoire_de_la_ville.htm Mahdia: Historical Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109154752/http://www.commune-mahdia.gov.tn/ENG/presentation_ville/histoire_de_la_ville.htm |date=9 November 2013 }}". Commune-mahdia.gov.tn.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fatimids entered Egypt in the late 10th century, conquering the [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] and founding a capital at ''al-Qāhira''([[Cairo]]) in 969.&lt;ref name="Beeson 24, 26–30"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm |title=Cairo, a Millennial |access-date=9 August 2007 |first=Irene |last=Beeson |pages=24, 26–30 |date=September–October 1969 |journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930163720/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to the planet Mars, "The Subduer", which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started. Cairo was intended as a royal enclosure for the Fatimid caliph and his army, though the actual administrative and economic capital of Egypt was in cities such as [[Fustat]] until 1169.  After Egypt, the Fatimids continued to conquer surrounding areas until they ruled from Tunisia to Syria and even crossed the Mediterranean into Sicily and southern Italy.

Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Yemen and the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, R. (2008). An introduction to Islam for Jews. Philadelphia: JPS/Jewish Publication Society. Page 66&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its [[Song dynasty]], which determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]].

Unlike other governments in the area, Fatimid advancement in state offices was based more on merit than heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, including Sunnis, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance covered non-Muslims such as Christians and Jews; they took high levels in government based on ability.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, J.-E., Redissi, H., &amp; Ṣaydāwī, R. (2009). Religion and politics: Islam and Muslim civilization. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub. Company. Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, exceptions to this general attitude of tolerance, notably [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]].

The Fatimid palace was in two parts. It was in the [[Khan el-Khalili]] area at Bin El-Quasryn street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm Cairo_of_the_mind, oldroads.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092655/http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |date=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Caliphs]] claimed spiritual supremacy not only in Egypt, but also contested the religious leadership of Syria. At the beginning of the Abbasid realm in Baghdad, the Alids faced severe persecution by the ruling party as they were a direct threat to the Caliphate. Owing to the Abbasid inquisitions, the forefathers opted for concealment of the Dawa's existence. Subsequently, they travelled towards the Iranian Plateau and distanced themselves from the epicenter of the political world. Al Mahdi's father, Al Husain al Mastoor returned to control the Dawa's affairs. He sent two Dai's to Yemen and Western Africa. Al Husain died soon after the birth of his son, Al Mahdi. A system of government helped update Al Mahdi on the development which took place in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Melvill Gwatkin|author2=James Pounder Whitney|author3=Joseph Robson Tanner |author4=Charles William Previté-Orton |author5=Zachary Nugent Brooke|title=The Cambridge Medieval History|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgemediev00broogoog|year=1913|publisher=Macmillan|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgemediev00broogoog/page/n409 379]–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Mahdi [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]] established the first [[Imam]] of the Fatimid dynasty. He claimed genealogic origins dating as far back as Fatimah through Husayn and Ismail. Al Mahdi established his headquarters at Salamiyah and moved towards north-western Africa, under [[Aghlabid]] rule. His success of laying claim to being the precursor to the Mahdi was instrumental among the Berber tribes of North Africa, specifically the Kutamah tribe. Al Mahdi established himself at the former Aghlabid residence at Raqqadah, a suburb of [[Al-Qayrawan]] in Tunisia. In 920, Al Mahdi took up residence at the newly established capital of the empire, [[Al-Mahdiyyah]]. After his death, Al Mahdi was succeeded by his son, Abu Al-Qasim Muhammad Al-Qaim, who continued his expansionist policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.mumineen.org/awliya/aimmat/e_imamqaim.html al-Qaim bi-Amrillah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210105748/http://archive.mumineen.org/awliya/aimmat/e_imamqaim.html |date=10 February 2006 }}. archive.mumineen.org&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death he had extended his reign to Morocco of the [[Idrisids]], as well as Egypt itself.The Fatimid Caliphate grew to include [[Sicily]] and to stretch across [[North Africa]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Libya]].{{sfn|Yeomans|2006|p=44}} Abdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Libya]], which he ruled from [[Mahdia]], in Tunisia.

The Fatimid general Jawhar conquered Egypt in 969, and he built a new palace city there, near Fusṭāt, which he also called al-Manṣūriyya. Under [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah]], the Fatimids conquered the [[Ikhshidid Wilayah]] (see [[Fatimid Egypt]]), founding a new capital at ''al-Qāhira'' ([[Cairo]]) in 969.&lt;ref name="Beeson 24, 26–30"/&gt; The name was a reference to the planet Mars, "The Subduer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Cairo.htm/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521030532/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Cairo.htm |archive-date=21 May 2016 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started.

Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to [[China]] and its [[Song Dynasty]], which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]].

After the eighteenth Imam, [[al-Mustansir Billah]], the Nizari sect believed that his son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] was his successor, while another Ismāʿīlī branch known as the Mustaali (from whom the Dawoodi Bohra would eventually descend), supported his other son, [[al-Musta'li]].  The Fatimid dynasty continued with al-Musta'li as both Imam and Caliph, and that joint position held until the 20th Imam, [[al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah]] (1132). At the death of Imam Amir, one branch of the Mustaali faith claimed that he had transferred the imamate to his son [[at-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]], who was then two years old.
After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the [[Zengid]] ruler [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nūr ad-Dīn]] had his general, [[Shirkuh]], seized Egypt from the vizier [[Shawar]] in 1169.

Beginning in the 8th century, the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Iberian Christian kingdoms]] had begun the [[Reconquista]] aimed at retaking Al-Andalus from the Moors. In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]], inspired by the conquests in Spain by Christian forces and implored by the [[Alexios I Komnenos|eastern Roman emperor]] to help defend Christianity in the East, called for the [[First Crusade]] from Western Europe which captured [[Edessa]], [[Antioch]], [[County of Tripoli]] and Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Hallam|title=View of the State of Europe During the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49|year=1870|publisher=W. J. Widdleton|pages=49–|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period of the Crusades, the Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] emerged and for a time controlled Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and other smaller [[Crusader kingdoms]] over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the [[Levant]], but did not threaten the Islamic Caliphate nor other powers in the region. After [[Shirkuh]] ended Fatimid rule in 1169, uniting it with Syria, the Crusader kingdoms were faced with a threat, and his nephew Saladin reconquered most of the area in 1187, leaving the Crusaders holding a few ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=5|title=The Literary Era: A Monthly Repository of Literary and Miscellaneous Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjHZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA133|year=1898|publisher=Porter &amp; Coates|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Third Crusade]] armies from Europe failed to recapture Jerusalem, though Crusader states lingered for several decades, and other crusades followed. The Christian Reconquista continued in Al-Andalus, and was eventually completed with the [[Granada War|fall of Granada]] in 1492. During the low period of the Crusades, the [[Fourth Crusade]] was diverted from the Levant and instead took [[Constantinople]], leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (now the Byzantine Empire) further weakened in their long struggle against the [[Turkish peoples]] to the east. However, the crusaders did manage to damage Islamic caliphates; according to [[William of Malmesbury]], preventing them from further expansion into [[Christendom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sylvia Schein|title=Gateway to the Heavenly City: Crusader Jerusalem and the Catholic West (1099–1187)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaqY_g4i_ukC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-0649-9|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being targets of the Mamluks and the Mongols.

===Ayyubid dynasty===
{{Main|Ayyubid dynasty}}
[[File:Ayyubid Sultanate 1193 AD.jpg|thumb|Ayyubid empire]]The [[Ayyubid dynasty]] was founded by [[Saladin]] and centered in Egypt. In 1174, Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan and conquered the Near East region. The Ayyubids ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries, controlling Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. After Saladin, his sons contested control over the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually established himself in 1200. In the 1230s, Syria's Ayyubid rulers attempted to win independence from Egypt and remained divided until Egyptian Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored Ayyubid unity by taking over most of Syria, excluding [[Aleppo]], by 1247. In 1250, the dynasty in the Egyptian region was overthrown by slave regiments. A number of attempts to recover it failed, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and wrested control of what remained of the Ayyubid territories soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Lock|title=The Routledge Companion to the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkCKZ9Hs4-QC&amp;pg=PA180+|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-13137-1|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mongol invasions and conquests}}

After the Crusades the [[Mongol invasions|Mongols]] invaded in the 13th century, marking the end of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. Some historians assert that the eastern Islamic world never fully recovered. Under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]], The Mongols put an end to the Abbasid era. The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] began in 1219 at a huge cost in civilian life and economic devastation. The Mongols spread throughout Central Asia and Persia: the Persian city of [[Isfahan]] had fallen to them by 1237.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/ilkhanate.html The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Il-Khanate)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015081646/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/ilkhanate.html |date=15 October 2013 }}. ucalgary.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

With the election of Khan [[Möngke Khan|Mongke]] in 1251, the Mongols targeted the Abbasid capital, Baghdad. Mongke's brother, [[Hulegu]], was made leader of the [[Mongol Army]] assigned to the task of subduing Baghdad. The [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Bagdhad]] in 1258 destroyed what had been the largest city in Islam.  The last Abbasid caliph, [[al-Musta'sim]], was captured and killed; and Baghdad was ransacked and destroyed. The cities of Damascus and Aleppo fell in 1260. Plans for the conquest of Egypt were delayed due to the death of Mongke at around the same time. The Abbasid army lost to the superior Mongol army, but the invaders were finally stopped by Egyptian Mamluks north of Jerusalem in 1260 at the pivotal [[Battle of Ain Jalut]].&lt;ref&gt;Tschanz, David W. (July/August 2007). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070912161811/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200704/history.s.hinge.ain.jalut.htm History's Hinge: 'Ain Jalut]".

Most Ilkhanid rulers were replaced by the new Mongol power founded by [[Timur]] (himself a Muslim), who conquered Persia in the 1360s, and moved against the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in India and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in [[Anatolia]].

Remarkable was the invention of [[Tamerlane Chess]], reconstruction of the city of [[Samarkand]], and substantial contributions made by the family of Sultan [[Shah Rukh]], which include [[Gawhar Shad]], polymath [[Ulugh Begh]], and [[Sultan Husayn Bayqara]] in the fields of astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. The empire receive widespread support from multiple [[Islamic scholars]] and scientists. A number of Islamic learning centres and mosques were built, most notably the [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]].

The prosperity of the city of [[Herat]] is said to have competed with those of [[Florence]], the birthplace of the [[Italian Renaissance]] as the center of a cultural rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Periods of World History: A Latin American Perspective - Page 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia - Page 465&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1250, the Ayyubid Egyptian dynasty was overthrown by [[Mamluk|slave regiments]], and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was born. Military prestige was at the center of Mamluk society, and it played a key role in the confrontations with the [[Mongol Empire]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]]. In the 1260s, the Mongols sacked and controlled the Islamic Near East territories. The Mamluks, who were [[slave-soldier]]s predominantly of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]], and [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern European]] origins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stowasser |first=Karl |date=1984 |title=Manners and Customs at the Mamluk Court |journal=[[Muqarnas (journal)|Muqarnas]] |volume=2 |issue=The Art of the Mamluks |location=[[Leiden]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |pages=13–20 |doi=10.2307/1523052 |jstor=1523052 |issn=0732-2992 |s2cid=191377149 |quote=The Mamluk slave warriors, with an empire extending from [[Libya]] to the [[Euphrates]], from [[Cilicia]] to the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Sudan]], remained for the next two hundred years the most formidable power of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] – champions of [[Sunni orthodoxy]], guardians of [[Holiest sites in Islam|Islam's holy places]], their capital, Cairo, the seat of the Sunni caliph and a magnet for scholars, artists, and craftsmen uprooted by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol upheaval in the East]] or drawn to it from all parts of the Muslim world by its wealth and prestige. Under their rule, Egypt passed through a period of prosperity and brilliance unparalleled since the days of the [[Ptolemies]]. [...] They ruled as a [[military]] [[aristocracy]], aloof and almost totally isolated from the native population, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, and their ranks had to be replenished in each generation through fresh imports of slaves from abroad. Only those who had grown up outside Muslim territory and who entered as slaves in the service either of the [[sultan]] himself or of one of the Mamluk [[emir]]s were eligible for membership and careers within their closed military caste. The offspring of Mamluks were free-born Muslims and hence excluded from the system: they became the ''awlād al-nās'', the "sons of respectable people", who either fulfilled scribal and administrative functions or served as commanders of the non-Mamluk ''ḥalqa'' troops. Some two thousand slaves were imported annually: [[Kipchaks|Qipchaq]], [[Azeris]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbec Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], [[Bulgars]], [[Albanians]], [[Serbs]], [[Hungarians]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayalon 1991"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-last=Ayalon |author-first=David |author-link=David Ayalon |year=2012 |origyear=1991 |title=Mamlūk |editor1-last=Bosworth |editor1-first=C.

The Mongols were again defeated by the Mamluks at the [[First Battle of Homs|Battle of Hims]] a few months later, and then driven out of Syria altogether.&lt;ref name="AHGC" /&gt; With this, the Mamluks were able to concentrate their forces and to conquer the last of the [[Crusader states]] in the Levant. Thus they united Syria and Egypt for the longest interval between the Abbasid and Ottoman empires (1250–1517).&lt;ref name="Hourani"&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluks experienced a continual state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition between the "Muslim territory" ([[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|Dar al-Islam]]) and "non-Muslim territory" ([[Dar al-Harb]]).&lt;ref name="Ayalon 1991"/&gt; The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] and the glorious [[Battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303)]], the latter partly led by Imam [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], marked the end of the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]].

Though some construction took place in the provinces, the vast bulk of these projects expanded the capital. Many Mamluk buildings in Cairo have survived to this day, particularly in Old Cairo (for further informations, see [[Mamluk architecture]]).

{{Main|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Taifa}}

The Arabs, under the command of the Berber General [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]], first began their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the [[Visigothic kingdom]] in [[Hispania]]. Crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (named after the General), it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] was defeated and killed on 19 July at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]] crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula. Some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain [[Ṭārif]] in 710 and also, the Ad Sebastianum recension of the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'', refers to an Arab attack incited by [[Erwig]] during the reign of [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]] (672–80). The two large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought.&lt;ref name=Collins2004139&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2004|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of [[Emir]] by the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] in [[Damascus]]. After the [[Abbasids]] came to power, some Umayyads fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there. By the end of the 10th century, the ruler [[Abd al-Rahman III]] took over the title of ''[[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliph of Córdoba]]''(912-961).&lt;ref name="Hourani 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Umayyads went on developing a strengthened state with its capital as [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. [[Al-Hakam II]] succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glubb |first=John Bagot|title=The course of empire: The Arabs and their successors |url=https://archive.org/details/courseofempirear0000glub |url-access=registration |year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=[https://archive.org/details/courseofempirear0000glub/page/128 128] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glick |first=Thomas F. |title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the early Middle Ages |year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-14771-3 |page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets. The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Luscombe |first=David Edward |author2=Jonathan Riley-Smith |title=The new Cambridge medieval history |year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41410-4 |page=599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Umayyad Caliphate collapsed in 1031 due to political divisions and civil unrest during the rule of [[Hicham II]] who was ousted because of his indolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |title=A History of Medieval Spain |year=1983 |publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-9264-8 |page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Andalus then broke up into a number of states called ''[[taifa kings|taifa kingdoms]]'' (Arabic, ''Muluk al-ṭawā'if''; English, Petty kingdoms). The decomposition of the Caliphate into those [[petty kingdom]]s weakened the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula ''vis-à-vis'' the Christian kingdoms of the north. Some of the ''taifas'', such as that of Seville, were forced to enter into alliances with Christian princes and pay tributes in money to Castille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Constable |first=Olivia Remie |title=Medieval Iberia: Readings from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |year=1997 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-1569-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/medievaliberiare00cons/page/n132 103] |chapter=The Political Dilemma of a Granadan Ruler |url=https://archive.org/details/medievaliberiare00cons |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abd al-Rahman I]] and Bedr (a former Greek slave) escaped with their lives after the popular revolt known as the [[Abbasid Revolution]]. Rahman I continued south through Palestine, the Sinai, and then into Egypt. Rahman I was one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make a perilous trek to Ifriqiya at this time. Rahman I and Bedr reached modern day Morocco near [[Ceuta]]. Next step would be to cross to sea to al-Andalus, where Rahman I could not have been sure whether he would be welcome. Following the [[Berber Revolt]] (740s), the province was in a state of confusion, with the [[Ummah]] torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. Bedr lined up three Syrian commanders – [[Obeid Allah ibn Uthman]] and [[Abd Allah ibn Khalid]], both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin and contacted al-Sumayl (then in [[Zaragoza]]) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Rahman I would try to make himself emir. After discussion with Yemenite commanders, Rahman I was told to go to al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he set off with Bedr and a small group of followers for Europe. Abd al-Rahman landed at [[Almuñécar]] in al-Andalus, to the east of [[Málaga]].

During his brief time in Málaga, he quickly amassed local support. News of the prince's arrival spread throughout the peninsula. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he took advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman and his followers were able to [[Zaragoza#Moorish Saraqusta|control Zaragoza]]. Rahman I fought to rule al-Andalus in a battle at the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir river]], just outside Córdoba on the plains of Musarah (Battle of Musarah). Rahman I was victorious, chasing his enemies from the field with parts of their army. Rahman I marched into the capital, Córdoba, fighting off a [[counterattack]], but negotiations ended the confrontation. After Rahman I consolidated power, he proclaimed himself the al-Andalus emir. Rahman I did not claim the Muslim caliph, though.&lt;ref&gt;This was likely because al-Andalus was a land besieged by many different loyalties, and the proclamation of caliph would have likely caused much unrest. Abd al-Rahman's progeny would, however, take up the title of caliph.&lt;/ref&gt; The last step was to have al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, garroted in Córdoba's jail. Al-Andalus was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for the house of Umayya that managed to evade the Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hamilton Morgan. Lost History: The Enduring Legacy of Muslim Scientists, Thinkers, and Artists. National Geographic Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baghdad, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]] had planned to depose the emir. Rahman I and his army confronted the Abbasids, killing most of the Abbasid army. The main Abbasid leaders were decapitated, their heads preserved in salt, with identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Rahman I quelled repeated rebellions in al-Andalus. He began the building of the great mosque [cordova], and formed ship-yards along the coast; he is moreover said to have been the first to transplant the palm and the pomegranate into the congenial climate of Spain: and he encouraged science and literature in his states. He died on 29 September 788, after a reign of thirty-four years and one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns5PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA385|year=1839|publisher=C. Knight|pages=385–|volume=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamezquitacordoba.jpg|thumb|The exterior of the Mezquita.]]
Rahman I's successor was his son [[Hisham I]]. Born in Córdoba, he built many [[mosque]]s and completed the [[Mezquita]]. He called for a [[jihad]] that resulted in a campaign against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and the [[County of Toulouse]]; in this second campaign he was defeated at Orange by [[William of Gellone]], first cousin to [[Charlemagne]]. His successor [[Al-Hakam I]] came to power and was challenged by his uncles, other sons of Rahman I. One, Abdallah, went to the court of Charlemagne in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] to negotiate for aid. In the meantime Córdoba was attacked, but was defended. Hakam I spent much of his reign suppressing rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and Mérida.&lt;ref&gt;P{{cite book|author1=P. M.

[[Abd ar-Rahman II]] succeeded his father and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], whose southward advance he halted. Rahman II repulsed an assault by [[Vikings]] who had disembarked in [[Cádiz]], conquered [[Seville]] (with the exception of its [[citadel]]) and attacked Córdoba. Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval [[arsenal]] at [[Seville]] to repel future raids.  He responded to [[William of Septimania]]'s requests of assistance in his struggle against [[Charles the Bald]]'s nominations.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad I]]'s reign was marked by the movements of the [[Muwallad]] (ethnic Iberian Muslims) and [[Mozarab]]s (Muslim-Iberia Christians). Muhammad I was succeeded by his son [[Al-Mundhir of Córdoba|Mundhir I]]. During the reign of his father, Mundhir I commanded military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and the Muwallad rebellions. At his father's death, he inherited the throne. During his two-year reign, Mundhir I fought against [[Umar ibn Hafsun]]. He died in 888 at Bobastro, succeeded by his brother [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]].

Umawi showed no reluctance to dispose of those he viewed as a threat. His government was marked by continuous wars between Arabs, Berbers and Muwallad. His power as emir was confined to the area of Córdoba, while the rest had been seized by rebel families. The son he had designated as successor was killed by one of Umawi's brothers. The latter was in turn executed by Umawi's father, who named as successor [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], son of the killed son of Umawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Maribel |last=Fierro|title=Abd-al-Rahman III of Córdoba|location=Oxford|publisher=Oneworld Publications|year=2005|isbn= 978-1-85168-384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ibn Idhari]] |others=trans.

By 640 the Arabs controlled [[Mesopotamia]], had invaded [[Armenia]], and were concluding their conquest of [[Byzantine Syria]]. [[Damascus]] was the seat of the [[Umayyad caliphate]]. By the end of 641 all of [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] was in Arab hands. A subsequent attempt to conquer the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdom of [[Makuria]] was however repelled.

This part of Islamic territory has had independent governments during most of Islamic history. The [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid]] were the first Arab rulers in the western [[Maghreb]] (Morocco), ruling from 788 to 985. The dynasty is named after its first [[sultan]] [[Idris I]].&lt;ref&gt;Y.

The [[Almoravid dynasty]] was a Berber dynasty from the [[Sahara]] flourished over a wide area of North-Western Africa and the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the 11th century. Under this dynasty the [[Moorish]] empire was extended over present-day Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Gibraltar, [[Tlemcen]] (in Algeria) and a part of what is now [[Senegal]] and [[Mali]] in the south, and Spain and Portugal in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Almoravides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Almohad Dynasty]] or "the Unitarians", were a Berber Muslim religious power which founded the fifth [[Moorish]] dynasty in the 12th century, and conquered all Northern Africa as far as Egypt, together with Al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Almonades, Reinhart Dozy, Second edition, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn of Africa===
[[File:Zeila ruins.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|Ruins of [[Zeila]] (Saylac), Somalia.]]
{{main|Islam in Ethiopia|Islam in Somalia}}

The history of Islam in the [[Horn of Africa]] is almost as old as the faith itself. Through extensive trade and social interactions with their converted Muslim trading partners on the other side of the [[Red Sea]], in the [[Arabian peninsula]], merchants and sailors in the Horn region gradually came under the influence of the new religion.&lt;ref name="Sct"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014) A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic disciples fled to the port city of [[Zeila]] in modern-day northern [[Somalia]] to seek protection from the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] at the court of the [[Aksumite Empire|Aksumite Emperor]] in present-day Somalia. Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had by then all adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the Red Sea came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]]. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region.&lt;ref name="Sct"/&gt;

===Great Lakes===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0232, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Arabische Moschee.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]]]]

Islam came to the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of South Eastern Africa along existing trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P.-J. (2004). Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal cultural corridor in the western Indian Ocean, 1799–1856. Leiden: Brill. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; They learned from them the manners of the Muslims and this led to their conversion by the Muslim Arabs.

Local Islamic governments centered in [[Islam in Tanzania|Tanzania]] (then [[Zanzibar]]). The people of ''[[Zayd]]'' were Muslims that immigrated to the Great Lakes region. In the pre-colonial period, the structure of Islamic authority here was held up through the ''[[Ulema]]'' (''wanawyuonis'', in [[Swahili language]]). These leaders had some degree of authority over most of the Muslims in South East Africa before territorial boundaries were established. The chief [[Qadi]] there was recognized for having the final religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nimtz, Jr. |first=August H.  |title=Islam and Politics in East Aftrica. the Sufi Order in Tanzania |year=1980|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Indian subcontinent]], Islam first appeared in the southwestern tip of the peninsula, in today's [[Kerala]] state. Arabs traded with [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] even before the birth of Muhammad. Native legends say that a group of [[Sahaba]], under [[Malik Bin Deenar|Malik Ibn Deenar]], arrived on the [[Malabar Coast]] and preached Islam. According to that legend, [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|the first mosque of India]] was built by Second Chera King Cheraman Perumal, who accepted Islam and received the name ''Tajudheen''. Historical records suggest that the [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|Cheraman Perumal Mosque]] was built in around 629.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web

Islamic rule first came to the Indian subcontinent in the 8th century, when [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered [[Sindh]], though this was a short-lived consolidation of Indian territory. Islamic conquests expanded under [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in the 12th century CE, resulting in the establishment of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]] in the Indus River basin and the subsequent prominence of [[Lahore]] as an eastern bastion of Ghaznavid culture and rule. Ghaznavid rule was eclipsed by the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurid Empire]] of [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad]], whose domain under the conquests of [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] extended until the [[Bengal]], where Indian [[Islamic missionary activity|Islamic missionaries]] achieved their greatest success in terms of [[dawah]] and number of converts to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pp. 227-228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, Dr. R.C., ''History of Mediaeval Bengal'', First published 1973, Reprint 2006, Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata, {{ISBN|81-89118-06-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2019}} [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]] conquered [[Delhi]] in 1206 and began the reign of the [[Delhi Sultanate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Srivastava|first=Ashirvadi Lal|title=The Sultanate Of Delhi 711–1526 AD|url=https://archive.org/stream/sultanateofdelhi001929mbp#page/n5/mode/2up|year=1929|publisher=Shiva Lal Agarwala &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; a successive series of dynasties that synthesized Indian civilization with the wider commercial and cultural networks of Africa and Eurasia, greatly increased demographic and economic growth in India and deterred Mongol incursion into the prosperous [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo-Gangetic plain]] and enthroned one of the few female Muslim rulers, [[Razia Sultana]].

Many prominent sultanates and emirates administered various regions of the Indian subcontinent from the 13th to the 16th centuries, such as the [[Qutb Shahi]], [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat]], [[Shah Mir dynasty|Kashmir]], [[Bengal Sultanate|Bengal]], [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] and [[Bahmani|Bahmani Sultanates]], but none rivaled the power and extensive reach of the [[Mughal Empire]] at its zenith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=Edward Singleton|author-link=Edward Singleton Holden|title=The Mogul emperors of Hindustan, A.D. 1398 – A.D. 1707|url=https://archive.org/stream/mogulemperorsofh00hold#page/n9/mode/2up|year=1895|publisher=New York : C.

Bengal [...] was rich in the production and export of grain, salt, fruit, liquors and wines, precious metals and ornaments besides the output of its handlooms in silk and cotton. Europe referred to Bengal as the richest country to trade with.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Shah Mir dynasty ensured the gradual conversion of [[Kashmiris]] to Islam.

Persian culture, art, language, cuisine and literature grew in prominence in India due to Islamic administration and the immigration of soldiers, bureaucrats, merchants, Sufis, artists, poets, teachers and architects from Iran and Central Asia, resulting in the early development of [[Indo-Persian culture]].

===Southeast Asia===
[[File:Masjid demak.jpg|thumb|200px|Grand Mosque of [[Sultanate of Demak|Demak]], the first Muslim state in Java]]
{{See also|The spread of Islam in Indonesia (1200 to 1600)}}

Islam first reached [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] through traders from Mecca in the 7th century,&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt; particularly via the western part of what is now [[Indonesia]]. Arab traders from Yemen already had a presence in Asia through trading and travelling by sea, serving as intermediary traders to and from Europe and Africa. They traded not only Arabian goods but also goods from Africa, India, and so on which included ivory, fragrances, spices, and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Le Bon. (1956). ''Hadarat al Arab''. Translation of La Civilisation-des Arabes. 3rd Print. Cairo. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[T.W. Arnold]] in ''The Preaching of Islam'', by the 2nd century of the Islamic Calendar, Arab traders had been trading with the inhabitants of [[Ceylon]], modern-day Sri Lanka. The same argument has been told by Dr. B.H. Burger and Dr. Mr. Prajudi in ''Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia'' (History of Socio Economic of Indonesia)&lt;ref&gt;Suryanegara, Ahmad Mansyur. (2009). ''Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia'' (History of Socio-Economic of Indonesia). API Sejarah. Bandung. Indonesia. pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; According to an atlas created by the geographer Al-Biruni (973–1048), the Indian or Indonesian Ocean used to be called the Persian Ocean. After Western Imperialist rule, this name was changed to reflect the name used today; the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Thomas Arnold]] and Alfred Guilaume, (eds.), (1965). ''The Legacy of Islam''. Oxford University Press, New York, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, many [[Sufi]] missionaries translated classical [[Sufi literature]] from Arabic and Persian into [[Malay language|Malay]]; a tangible product of this is the [[Jawi script]]. Coupled with the composing of original [[Islamic literature]] in Malay, this led the way to the transformation of Malay into an Islamic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1292, when [[Marco Polo]] visited Sumatra, most of the inhabitants had converted to Islam. The [[Sultanate of Malacca]] was founded on the [[Malay Peninsula]] by [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], a [[Srivijaya]]n Prince.

Through trade and commerce, Islam then spread to [[Borneo]] and [[Java]]. By the late 15th century, [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] had been introduced to the [[Philippines]] via the southern island of [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&amp;pg=PA419|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|pages=419–|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foremost{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} socio-cultural Muslim entities that resulted form this are the present-day [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]]; Islamised kingdoms in the northern [[Luzon]] island, such as the [[Kingdom of Maynila]] and the [[Kingdom of Tondo]], were later conquered and [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] with the majority of the archipelago by [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonisers]] beginning in the 16th century.

As Islam spread, societal changes developed from the individual conversions, and five centuries later it emerged as a dominant cultural and political power in the region. Three main Muslim political powers emerged. The [[Aceh Sultanate]] was the most important, controlling much of the area between Southeast Asia and India from its centre in northern [[Sumatra]]. The Sultanate also attracted [[Sufi poetry|Sufi poets]]. The second Muslim power was the [[Malacca Sultanate|Sultanate of Malacca]] on the Malay Peninsula. The [[Demak Sultanate|Sultanate of Demak]] on Java was the third power, where the emerging Muslim forces defeated the local [[Majapahit]] kingdom in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=226–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sultanate managed to expand its territory somewhat, its rule remained brief.&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt;

[[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] forces captured Malacca in 1511 under naval general [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]. With Malacca subdued, the [[Aceh Sultanate]] and [[Bruneian Empire]] established themselves as centres of Islam in Southeast Asia. The Sultanate's territory, although vastly diminished, remains intact to this day as the modern state of [[Brunei Darussalam]].&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt;

In China, four Sahabas (Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas, Wahb Abu Kabcha, [[Jafar ibn Abu Talib]] and [[Jahsh ibn Riyab]]) preached in 616/17 and onwards after following the [[Chittagong]]&amp;ndash;[[Kamrup region|Kamrup]]&amp;ndash;[[Manipur]] route after sailing from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in 615/16. After conquering Persia in 636, Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas went with [[Sa'id ibn Zaid]], [[Qais ibn Sa'd]] and [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] to China in 637 taking the complete Quran. Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas headed for China for the third time in 650–51 after Caliph Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China, which the Chinese emperor received.&lt;ref&gt;Khamouch, Mohammed.

== Early Modern period ==
{{main|Early modern history}}
In the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Middle East, the [[Balkans]] and [[Northern Africa]]; the [[Safavid Empire]] in [[Greater Iran]]; and the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of [[gunpowder]] and more efficient administration.&lt;ref name="Armstrong116"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|2000|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Osman I]], the founder of the [[Ottoman dynasty]], assumed leadership of one of these principalities ([[Söğüt]]) at the end of the thirteenth century, succeeding his father [[Ertuğrul]]. Osman I afterwards led it in a series of battles with the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, G. C. (2006). Dictionary of wars. New York: Facts on File. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1331, the Ottomans had captured [[Nicaea]], the former Byzantine capital, under the leadership of Osman's son and successor, [[Orhan I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koprulu|1992|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victory at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] against the [[Serb]]s in 1389 then facilitated their expansion into Europe. The Ottomans were established in the [[Balkans]] and Anatolia by the time [[Bayezid I]] ascended to power in the same year, now at the helm of a growing empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koprulu|1992|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth halted when Mongol warlord [[Timur]] (also known as "''Tamerlane''") captured Bayezid I in the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, beginning the [[Ottoman Interregnum]]. This episode was characterized by the division of the Ottoman territory amongst Bayezid I's sons, who submitted to [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] authority. When a number of Ottoman territories regained independent status, ruin for the Empire loomed. However, the empire recovered, as the youngest son of Bayezid I, [[Mehmed I]], waged offensive campaigns against his ruling brothers, thereby reuniting [[Asia Minor]] and declaring himself sultan in 1413.&lt;ref name="AHGC"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Applied History Research Group |publisher=University of Calagary |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/index2.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600 |access-date=18 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410125136/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/index2.html |archive-date=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time the Ottoman [[Navy|naval]] fleet developed, such that they were able to challenge [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], a [[naval power]]. They also attempted to reconquer the Balkans. By the time of Mehmed I's grandson, [[Mehmed II]] (ruled 1444–1446; 1451–1481), the Ottomans could lay siege to [[Constantinople]], the capital of Byzantium. A factor in this siege was the use of [[muskets]] and large [[cannon]]s introduced by the Ottomans. The Byzantine fortress [[Fall of Constantinople|succumbed]] in 1453, after 54 days of siege. Without its capital the Byzantine Empire disintegrated.&lt;ref name="AHGC"/&gt; The future successes of the Ottomans and later empires would depend upon the exploitation of [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong116"/&gt;

In the early 16th century, the Shi'ite [[Safavid dynasty]] assumed control in Persia under the leadership of [[Shah]] [[Ismail I]], defeating the ruling [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] federation [[Aq Qoyunlu]] (also called the "White Sheep Turkomans") in 1501. The Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]] sought to repel Safavid expansion, challenging and defeating them at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514. Selim I also deposed the ruling Mamluks in Egypt, absorbing their territories in 1517. [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] (also known as ''Suleiman the Magnificent''), Selim I's successor, took advantage of the diversion of Safavid focus to the [[Uzbeks]] on the eastern frontier and recaptured Baghdad, which had fallen under Safavid control. Despite this, Safavid power remained substantial, rivalling the Ottomans. Suleiman I advanced deep into Hungary following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526 — [[Siege of Vienna (1529)|reaching as far as the gates of Vienna]] thereafter, and signed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with [[Francis I of France]] against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] 10 years later. While Suleiman I's rule (1520–1566) is often identified as the apex of Ottoman power, the empire continued to remain powerful and influential until a relative fall in its military strength in the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor  |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Introduction |date=2009 |page=xxxii}}

The Shia [[Safavid dynasty]] rose to power in [[Tabriz]] in 1501 and later conquered the rest of Iran.

This resulted in the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam]]. [[Zaydis]], the largest group amongst the Shia before the [[Safavid Dynasty]] were also forced to convert to the Twelver Shia. The [[Zaydis]] at that time used the Hanafi Fiqh, as did most Sunnis and there were good relations between them.

The [[Safavids]] dynasty from [[Azarbaijan]] ruled from 1501 to 1736, and which established [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] Islam as the region's [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|official religion]] and united its provinces under a single sovereignty, thereby reigniting the [[History of Iran|Persian]] identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Why is there such confusion about the origins of this important dynasty, which reasserted Iranian identity and established an independent Iranian state after eight and a half centuries of rule by foreign dynasties?''

The name "Iran" disappeared from official records of the Saffarids, Samanids, Buyids, Saljuqs and their successor. But one unofficially used the name Iran, Eranshahr, and similar national designations, particularly Mamalek-e Iran or "Iranian lands", which exactly translated the old Avestan term Ariyanam Daihunam. On the other hand, when the Safavids (not Reza Shah, as is popularly assumed) revived a national state officially known as Iran, bureaucratic usage in the Ottoman empire and even Iran itself could still refer to it by other descriptive and traditional appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Although claiming to be the descendants of [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]], the Safavids were [[Sunni]] (the name "Safavid" comes from a Sufi order called ''Safavi''). Their origins go back to [[Firuz Shah Zarrinkolah]], a local dignitary from the north. During their rule, the Safavids recognized Twelver Shi'a Islam as the State religion, thus giving the region a separate identity from its Sunni neighbours.

In 1524, [[Tahmasp I]] acceded to the throne, initiating a revival of the arts. [[Persian carpet|Carpetmaking]] became a major industry. The tradition of [[Persian miniature]] painting in manuscripts reached its peak, until Tahmasp turned to strict religious observance in middle age, prohibiting the consumption of alcohol and [[hashish]] and removing [[casino]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[brothel]]s.  Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] continued to patronize a last flowering of the arts until he was murdered, after which many artists were recruited by the Mughal dynasty.

Tahmasp's grandson, [[Shah Abbas I]], restored the shrine of the eighth Twelver Shi'a Imam, [[Ali al-Ridha]] at [[Mashhad]], and restored the dynastic shrine at [[Ardabil]]. Both shrines received jewelry, fine manuscripts and Chinese porcelains. Abbas moved the capital to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], revived old ports, and established thriving trade with Europeans. Amongst Abbas's most visible cultural achievements was the construction of ''[[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]]'' ("Design of the World"). The plaza, located near a Friday mosque, covered {{convert|20|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2000|pp=199–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Safavid Dynasty]] was toppled in 1722 by the [[Hotaki dynasty]], which ended their forceful conversion of Sunni areas to Shiaism.

Mughal Empire was a power that comprised almost all of [[South Asia]], founded in 1526.

The beginning of the empire is conventionally dated to the victory by its founder [[Babur]] over [[Ibrahim Lodi]], the last ruler of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], in the [[First Battle of Panipat]] (1526). During the reign of [[Humayun]], the successor of Babur, the empire was briefly interrupted by the [[Sur Empire]] established by [[Sher Shah Suri]], who re-established the [[Grand Trunk Road]] across the northern Indian subcontinent, initiated the [[rupee]] currency system and developed much of the foundations of the effective administration of Mughal rule. The "classic period" of the Mughal Empire began in 1556, with the ascension of [[Akbar]] to the throne. Some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a significant threat to the Mughal dominance of northwestern India, but most of them were subdued by Akbar. All Mughal emperors were [[Muslim]]s; Akbar, however, propounded a syncretic religion in the latter part of his life called [[Din-i-Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], as recorded in historical books like ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and ''[[Dabistān-i Mazāhib]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Makhan Lal |last=Roy Choudhury |title=The Din-i-Ilahi:Or, The Religion of Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mughal Empire did not try to intervene in native societies during most of its existence, rather co-opting and pacifying them through concilliatory administrative practices{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 115}}{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 90–91}} and a syncretic, inclusive ruling elite,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} leading to more systematic, centralized and uniform rule.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} Traditional and newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Rajputs]], the [[Pashtuns]], the [[Hindu Jats]] and the [[Khalsa|Sikhs]], gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Catherine Ella Blanshard Asher | author2=Cynthia Talbot | title=India before Europe | year= 2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-80904-7 | page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burjor Avari |title=Islamic Civilization in South Asia: A History of Muslim Power and Presence in the Indian Subcontinent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGHpVtQ8eKoC&amp;pg=PA131 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |pages=131– |isbn=978-0-415-58061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Erinn Banting |date=2003 |title=Afghanistan: The people |url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistanpeopl0000bant |url-access=registration |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistanpeopl0000bant/page/9 9]– |isbn=978-0-7787-9336-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}}
[[File:Taj Mahal (Edited).jpeg|thumb|[[Taj Mahal]] is a [[mausoleum]] built by [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] to house the tomb of his favourite wife, [[Mumtaz Mahal]].]]
The reign of [[Shah Jahan]] (1628–1658) represented the height of [[Mughal architecture]], with famous monuments such as the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Moti Masjid (Agra Fort)|Moti Masjid]], [[Red Fort]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] and [[Lahore Fort]] being constructed during his reign.

The [[sharia]] reign of [[Aurangzeb|Muhammad Auranzgeb]] witnessed the establishment of the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]],&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic and European Expansion: The Forging of a Global Order'', [[Michael Adas]], Temple University Press (Philadelphia, PA), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapra|first1=Muhammad Umer|title=Morality and Justice in Islamic Economics and Finance|date=2014|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9781783475728|pages=62–63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim [[India]] became the world's largest economy, valued 25% of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison|Maddison, Angus]] (2003): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rHJGz3HiJbcC&amp;pg=PA259 Development Centre Studies The World Economy Historical Statistics: Historical Statistics]'', [[OECD Publishing]], {{ISBN|9264104143}}, pages 259–261&lt;/ref&gt; Its richest province, [[Bengal Subah]], which was a world leading economy and have had better conditions to 18th-century [[Western Europe]],  showing signs of the [[Industrial Revolution]],&lt;ref name="voss" /&gt; through the emergence of the period of [[proto-industrialization]].&lt;ref name="voss"/&gt; Numerous conflicts such as the [[Anglo-Mughal War]] were also witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Conflict and Cooperation in Anglo-Mughal Trade Relations during the Reign of Aurangzeb|first=Farhat|last=Hasan|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=34|issue=4|date=1991|pages=351–360|doi=10.1163/156852091X00058|jstor=3632456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=John Company Armed: The English East India Company, the Anglo-Mughal War and Absolutist Imperialism, c. 1675–1690|first=James|last=Vaugn|journal=Britain and the World|volume=11|issue=1|date=September 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Aurangzeb]], which marks the end of Medieval India and beginning of the European colonialism in India, internal dissatisfaction arose due to the weakness of the empire's administrative and economic systems, leading to its break-up and declarations of independence of its former provinces by the [[Nawab of Bengal]], the [[Nawab of Awadh]], the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], the major economic and military power known as [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] and other small states. In 1739, the Mughals were crushingly defeated in the [[Battle of Karnal]] by the forces of [[Nader Shah]], the founder of the [[Afsharid dynasty]] in Persia, and Delhi was [[Sack of Delhi|sacked and looted]], drastically accelerating their decline.

In 1757, the [[East India Company]] overtook [[Bengal Subah]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]]. By the mid-18th century, the [[Maratha Confederacy|Marathas]] had routed Mughal armies and won over several Mughal provinces from the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] to [[Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sailendra Nath Sen |date=2010 |title=An Advanced History of Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82 |publisher=Macmillan India |page=Introduction 14 |isbn=978-0-230-32885-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tipu Sultan]]'s [[Kingdom of Mysore]] based in [[South India]], which witnessed partial establishment of [[sharia]] based economic and military policies i.e. [[Fathul Mujahidin]], replaced Bengal ruled by the [[Nawabs of Bengal]] as [[South Asia]]'s foremost economic territory.&lt;ref name="mehta"&gt;{{cite book|title=Widows, Pariahs, and Bayadères: India as Spectacle|author=Binita Mehta|publisher=[[Bucknell University Press]]|year=2002|pages=110–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wK1fAwgOercC&amp;pg=PA110|isbn=9780838754559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pande"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aurangzeb and Tipu Sultan: Evaluation of Their Religious Policies|author=B.

=== Ottoman Empire partition ===
{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S29571, Türkei, Dardanellen, MG-Stellung.jpg|thumb|Ottoman army in World War I]] 
By the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had declined. The decision to back [[Germany]] in [[World War I]] meant they shared the [[Central Powers]]' defeat in that war. The defeat led to the overthrow of the Ottomans by Turkish nationalists led by the victorious general of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]: [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], who became known to his people as Atatürk, "Father of the Turks." Atatürk was credited with renegotiating the [[treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) which ended Turkey's involvement in the war and establishing the modern [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]], which was recognized by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]. Atatürk went on to implement an ambitious program of modernization that emphasized economic development and [[secular]]ization. He transformed Turkish culture to reflect European laws, adopted [[Arabic numerals]], the [[Latin script]], separated the religious establishment from the state, and emancipated woman—even giving them the right to vote in parallel with [[women's suffrage]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=961, 969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War, the Allies cooperated with Arab partisans against the Ottoman Empire, both groups being united in opposition to a common enemy. The most prominent example of this was during the [[Arab Revolt]], when the British, led by secret intelligence agent [[T. E. Lawrence]]—better known as "Lawrence of Arabia" cooperated with Arab [[Guerilla warfare|guerillas]] against the Ottoman forces, eventually securing the withdrawal of all Ottoman troops from the region by 1918. Following the end of the war, the vast majority of former Ottoman territory outside of Asia Minor was handed over to the victorious European powers as [[protectorate]]s. However, many Arabs were left dismayed by the [[Balfour Declaration]], which directly contradicted the [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]] publicized only a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=971–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman successor states include today's [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], Egypt, Greece, Iraq, [[Israel]], Lebanon, [[Romania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Serbia]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], Turkey, Balkan states, North Africa and the north shore of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McNeill|Bentley|Christian|2005|p=1402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslim countries sought to adopt European political organization and [[nationalism]] began to emerge in the Muslim world. Countries like Egypt, Syria and Turkey organized their governments and sought to develop national pride among their citizens. Other places, like Iraq, were not as successful due to a lack of unity and an inability to resolve age-old prejudices between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims.

Some Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Egypt, sought to separate Islam from the secular government. In other cases, such as Saudi Arabia, the government brought out religious expression in the re-emergence of the puritanical form of Sunni Islam known to its detractors as [[Wahabism]], which found its way into the [[Saudi royal family]].

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
{{Main|Arab–Israeli conflict}}
The Arab–Israeli conflict spans about a century of political tensions and open hostilities. It involves the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] as a [[Jew]]ish [[nation state]], the consequent [[1948 Palestinian exodus|displacement]] of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], as well as the adverse relationship between the [[Arab]] states and the State of Israel (see related [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]). Despite at first involving only the Arab states bordering Israel, animosity has also developed between Israel and other predominantly [[Muslim world|Muslim states]].

The [[Six-Day War]] of 5–10 June 1967, was fought between [[Israel]] and the neighbouring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Arab countries closed the [[Suez Canal]] and it was followed in May 1970 by the closure of the "tapline" from Saudi Arabia through Syria to Lebanon. These developments had the effect of increasing the importance of [[petroleum]] in [[Libya]], which is a short (and canal-free) shipping distance from Europe. In 1970, [[Occidental Petroleum]] broke with other oil companies and accepted the Arab demands for price increases.

In October 1973, a new war between Israel and its Muslim neighbours, known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], broke out just as the oil companies began meeting with [[OPEC]] leaders. OPEC had been emboldened by the success of [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat's]] campaigns and the war strengthened their unity. In response to the emergency resupply effort by the [[Western Bloc|West]] that enabled Israel to put up a resistance against the Egyptian and Syrian forces, the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe. Faisal agreed that Saudi Arabia would use some of its oil wealth to finance the "front-line states", those that bordered Israel, in their struggle. The centrality of petroleum, the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and political and economic instability and uncertainty remain constant features of the politics of the region.

Many countries, individuals and [[non-governmental organizations]] elsewhere in the world feel involved in this conflict for reasons such as cultural and religious ties with Islam, [[Arab culture]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Jewish culture]], or for ideological, [[human rights]], or strategic reasons. Although some consider the Arab–Israeli conflict a part of (or a precursor to) a wider [[clash of civilizations]] between the [[Western World]] and the [[Muslim world]],&lt;ref&gt;Causes of Anti-Americanism in the Arab World: a Socio-Political perspective [http://www.rubincenter.org/meria/2003/12/abdallah.pdf] by Abdel Mahdi Abdallah (MERIA Journal).

In 1979 the [[Iranian Revolution]] transformed [[Iran]] from a constitutional monarchy to a [[Populism|populist]] [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamic republic]] under the rule of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], a Shi'i Muslim cleric and ''[[Marja'|marja]]''. Following the Revolution, and a new constitution was approved and a referendum established the government, electing Ruhollah Khomeini as [[Supreme Leader]]. During the following two years, liberals, leftists, and Islamic groups fought each other, and the Islamics captured power.

The development of the two opposite fringes, the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam]] the Twelver Shia version and its reinforcement by the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the [[Salafi]] in Saudi Arabia, coupled with the [[Iran–Saudi Arabia relations]] resulted in these governments using sectarian conflict to enhance their political interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heather S.

Certain Iranian exiles also helped convince Saddam that if he invaded, the fledgling Islamic republic would quickly collapse.
