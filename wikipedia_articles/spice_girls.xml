The '''Spice Girls''' are a British pop [[girl group]] formed in 1994. The group comprises [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]], also known as Mel B ("Scary Spice"), [[Melanie C]]hisholm, or Mel C ("Sporty Spice"), [[Emma Bunton]] ("Baby Spice"), [[Geri Halliwell]] ("Ginger Spice"), and [[Victoria Beckham]] ("Posh Spice").  In 1996, [[Top of the Pops (magazine)|''Top of the Pops'']] magazine gave each member of the group [[Pseudonym|aliases]], which were adopted by the group and media. With their "[[girl power]]" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase instead of a male audience.&lt;ref name=johnharlow/&gt;&lt;ref name=andrewsmith/&gt; They led the [[teen pop]] resurgence of the 1990s and became pop culture icons of the decade.&lt;ref name=sherrie&gt;{{cite book |title=Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World |last=Budgeon|first=Shelley|editor-last=Inness |editor-first=Sherrie A. |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |year=1998 |chapter=Chapter 5: 'I'll Tell You What I Really, Really Want': Girl Power and Self-Identity in Britain |page=115 |isbn=978-0847691371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spice girls bio"/&gt; They are cited as part of the [[Second British Invasion]] of the United States and were "arguably the most recognizable face" of [[Cool Britannia]], the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Time magazine"&gt;{{cite news |title= An Important Lesson in British History From the Spice Girls |url= http://time.com/4382880/spice-girls-20th-anniversary-wannabe/ |last= Waxman |first= Olivia B. |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 8 July 2016 |access-date= 31 October 2016 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20210209090529/https://time.com/4382880/spice-girls-20th-anniversary-wannabe/ |archive-date= 9 February 2021 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, ''[[Forever (Spice Girls album)|Forever]]'', was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies.&lt;ref name=simth206/&gt; At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, [[The Return of the Spice Girls Tour|the Return of the Spice Girls]] (2007–2008) and [[Spice World – 2019 Tour|Spice World]] (2019), both of which won the [[Billboard Live Music Awards|''Billboard'' Live Music Award]] for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

Measures of the Spice Girls' success include international record sales, [[Spice Girls merchandise and sponsorship deals|vast marketing enterprises]], iconic symbolism such as Halliwell's [[Union Jack dress]], a major motion picture, ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' (1997), and the highest-grossing concert tours by an all-female group from 2000 to 2020.&lt;ref name=pollstar/&gt; Under the guidance of their mentor and manager [[Simon Fuller]], the group embraced endorsement deals and merchandising to become one of the most successful marketing engines ever, with their global gross income estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998.&lt;ref name="ewspice"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Svetkey |first1=Benjamin |title=Cover Story: Spice Girl's Tour Divorce |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283983,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=29 October 2019 |date=17 July 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013153940/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283983,00.html|archive-date=13 October 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=earnings|group=nb|The group was also estimated to have made $300 million in music and video sales from October 1997 to October 1998,&lt;ref name=brandweek/&gt; and over £300 million ($500 million) from merchandising in 1997.&lt;ref name=bbcearnings/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; In November 1997, the British press estimated that the Spice Girls had amassed personal fortunes of at least £21 million ($34 million) each.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jacqueline|last1=McArthur|first2=Daniel|last2=Dasey|author3=AAP|authorlink3=Australian Associated Press|title=Impulse sales rush to $10m mark|work=[[The Sun-Herald]]|date=11 January 1998|page=6|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/367117367|url-access=subscription|access-date=28 March 2021 |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ginger spice 2"/&gt;}} They were also a regular feature of the British and global press which, according to ''[[Music Week]]'' writer [[Paul Gorman]], helped usher in an era of [[celebrity culture|celebrity obsession]] in pop culture.&lt;ref name="spice girls legacy"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, [[Bob Herbert (manager)|Bob]] and [[Chris Herbert]], the father-and-son duo of Heart Management, decided to create a girl group to compete with the [[boy band]]s who dominated the UK pop music scene at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with financier Chic Murphy, they envisioned an act comprising "five strikingly different girls"&lt;ref name="rolling stone interview"/&gt; who would each appeal to a different type of audience. In February 1994, Heart Management placed an advertisement in the trade paper ''[[The Stage]]'' asking for singers to audition for an all-female pop band at London's Danceworks studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 400 women attended the audition on 4 March 1994, during which they were placed in groups of 10 and danced a routine to "[[Stay (Eternal song)|Stay]]" by [[Eternal (band)|Eternal]], followed by solo auditions in which they were asked to perform songs of their own choosing.&lt;ref name=sinclair200838/&gt;

After several weeks of deliberation, [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]], [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]], [[Melanie C]]hisholm and [[Michelle Stephenson]] were among a dozen or so women who advanced to a second round of auditions in April.&lt;ref name=sinclair200838&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=40–41, 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm missed the second audition after coming down with [[tonsillitis]] while,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2019|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite missing the first round, [[Geri Halliwell]] persuaded the Herberts into letting her attend the second one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1999|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the second audition, Adams, Brown, Halliwell and Stephenson were asked to attend a recall at Nomis Studios in [[Shepherd's Bush]], performing "[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours]]" on their own and as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1999|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm was also invited to the recall as a last minute replacement for another finalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2019|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the session, the five women were selected for a band initially named "Touch".&lt;ref name="Sinclair2728"/&gt;

The group moved into a three-bedroom house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997a|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephenson, the material they were given was "very, very young pop," and none of these songs were later used by the Spice Girls.&lt;ref name="Sinclair29"&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these first months, the group worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. They were also tasked with choreographing their own dance routines, which they worked on at Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired due to a perceived lack of commitment.{{refn|group=nb|According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because "she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go".&lt;ref name=sinclair3031/&gt; Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she "just couldn't be arsed" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing.&lt;ref name=sinclair3031&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Heart Management turned to the group's vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, to find Stephenson's replacement. After Lemer's first recommendation turned down the offered spot, Lemer next recommended her former pupil, [[Emma Bunton]], who auditioned for the Herberts and joined Touch as the fifth member.&lt;ref name=sinclair3031/&gt;

As their training continued, the group performed small showcases for a few of Heart Management's associates. On one such performance, the group added a rap section they had written to one of Thirkell and Keiles' songs. Keiles was furious with the changes the group made and insisted they learn how to write songs properly. The group thus began professional songwriting lessons;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=86–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; during one of these sessions, they wrote a song called "Sugar and Spice" with Tim Hawes which inspired them to change their band name to "Spice".&lt;ref name=mcgibbon9798&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1994, the group felt insecure as they still did not have an official contract with Heart Management. They had also grown frustrated by the direction in which the management team was steering them. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an "overwhelmingly positive" reaction.&lt;ref name=sinclair20083334/&gt; Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members refused to sign the contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.&lt;ref name=sinclair20083334&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, in January, the group began songwriting sessions with [[Biffco|Richard Stannard]], whom they had impressed at the showcase, and his partner Matt Rowe. It was during these sessions that the songs "[[Wannabe]]" and "[[2 Become 1]]" were written.&lt;ref name=sinclair4049/&gt;

In March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|According to Tim Hawes, Halliwell had tricked him into giving her the master tapes, claiming the group needed them for rehearsals. Upon obtaining the tapes, the group walked out on Heart Management and Hawes never saw them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997b|pp=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing them to his company a few months later, Simon Fuller paid off a £50,000 settlement with the Herberts to ensure the group would not face legal problems with their previous managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2019|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The next day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based songwriter [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the Nomis showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. Through contacts they had made at the showcase, they were also introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]]. With Kennedy and Absolute's help, the group spent the next several weeks writing and recording demos for the majority of the songs that would end up on their debut album, including "[[Say You'll Be There]]" and "[[Who Do You Think You Are (Spice Girls song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]".&lt;ref name=sinclair4049&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their demos caught the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his management company in May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, the industry buzz around the group had grown significantly and the major record labels in London and Los Angeles were keen to sign them. The group found themselves at the centre of a bidding war that summer, eventually signing a five-album deal with [[Virgin Records]] in July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a record deal in place, Fuller took the group on an extensive promotional tour in Los Angeles, where they met with studio executives in the hopes of securing film and television opportunities for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halliwell|1999|pp=194, 197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their name was also changed to "Spice Girls" as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name "Spice". The new name was specifically chosen because the group noticed industry people often referred to them derisively as "the 'Spice' girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Sinclair|2008|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sggen/&gt; From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album.&lt;ref name=cripps141&gt;{{harvnb|Spice Girls|Cripps|Peachey|1997|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single "[[Wannabe]]" in the United Kingdom. In the weeks leading up to the release, the music video for "Wannabe" got a trial airing on music channel [[The Box (British and Irish TV channel)|The Box]].&lt;ref name=sinclair75&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was an instant hit, and was aired up to seventy times a week at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGibbon|1997a|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the video was released, the Spice Girls had their first live broadcast TV slot on [[LWT]]'s ''[[Surprise Surprise (British TV series)|Surprise Surprise]]''.

At the [[2010 Brit Awards]], the Spice Girls received a special award for "Best Performance of the 30th Year". The award was for their 1997 Brit Awards performance of "Wannabe" and "Who Do You Think You Are", and was accepted by Halliwell and Brown on behalf of the group. That same year, the group, along with Simon Fuller, teamed up with [[Judy Craymer]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] to develop a Spice Girls musical, ''[[Viva Forever! (musical)|Viva Forever!]]''. Similar to the [[ABBA]] musical ''[[Mamma Mia! (musical)|Mamma Mia!]]'', ''Viva Forever!'' used the music of the band as the backdrop for an original story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article6997164.ece |work=The Times |location= London |title= Viva Forever Mamma Mia creator creates Spice Girls musical |first= Ben |last= Hoyle |date= 22 January 2010 |access-date=23 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
According to [[Allmusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], the Spice Girls "used [[dance-pop]] as a musical base, but they infused the music with a fiercely independent, feminist stance that was equal parts [[Madonna]], post-[[riot grrrl]] alternative rock [[feminism]], and a co-opting of the good-times-all-the-time stance of England's new [[lad culture]]."&lt;ref name="spice girls bio"/&gt; Their songs incorporated a variety of genres, which Halliwell described as a "melding" of the group members' eclectic musical tastes,&lt;ref name="85m"&gt;{{cite news|date=12 July 2016|title=My Life as a Spice Girl: Geri "Ginger Spice" Halliwell (Now Horner) Looks Back at the Beginnings of a Pop Culture Phenomenon|first=Geri|last=Horner|work=[[Marie Claire]]|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a21505/geri-halliwell-spice-girls-story/|access-date=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210222054055/https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a21505/geri-halliwell-spice-girls-story/|archive-date=22 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise kept to mainstream pop conventions.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vicars of 'Wannabe': Authenticity and the Spice Girls|first=Elizabeth Eva|last=Leach|volume=20|issue=2|date=May 2001|pages=143–167|journal=Popular Music|doi=10.1017/S0261143001001386|issn=0261-1430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm said: "We all had different artists that we loved. Madonna was a big influence and [[TLC (group)|TLC]]; we watched a lot of their videos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/10/we-caught-the-zeitgeist-how-the-spice-girls-revolutionised-pop|title='We caught the zeitgeist': how the Spice Girls revolutionised pop|first=David|last=Sinclair|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 March 2018|access-date=3 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regular collaborator on the group's first two albums was the production duo known as [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], made up of Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins. Absolute initially found it difficult to work with the group as the duo was heavily into [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] music at the time, while the Spice Girls according to Wilson were "always very poptastic".&lt;ref name=sinclair4748&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson said of the group's musical output: "Their sound was actually not getting R&amp;B quite right."&lt;ref name=sinclair49&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Wannabe: How the Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame]]'' (2004), ''Rolling Stone'' journalist and biographer David Sinclair opined that the "undeniable artistry" of the group's songs had been overlooked. The Spice Girls, said Sinclair, "instinctively had an ear for a catchy tune without falling back on the formula balladry and bland modulations which the [[Westlife]]/[[Boyzone]] brigade have traditionally reeled off by the yard."&lt;ref name=sinclair8789&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised their "more sophisticated" sophomore album ''Spiceworld'', saying: "Peppered with personality, and each conveying a distinctive musical flavour and lyrical theme, these are songs which couldn't sound ''less'' 'manufactured,' and which, in several cases, transcend the pop genre altogether."&lt;ref name=sinclair8789/&gt;

===Lyrical themes===
[[File:Victoriaandemmaonpoleslv.jpg|right|thumb|215px|Beckham and Bunton performing "2 Become 1" in [[Las Vegas]] on 11 December 2007. The song, which addresses the importance of [[safe sex]], has been praised for its sex-positive message.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;]]

The common lyrical thread across the group's music is their message of female empowerment and solidarity.&lt;ref name="spice girls bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcgp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ferber&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/16-spice-girls-lyrics-that-were-way-ahead-of-their-time-deserve-a-rewind-79032|title=16 Spice Girls Lyrics That Were Ahead Of Their Time In The Best Possible Way|work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=16 May 2018|first=Taylor|last=Ferber|access-date=1 March 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210301154924/https://www.bustle.com/p/16-spice-girls-lyrics-that-were-way-ahead-of-their-time-deserve-a-rewind-79032|archive-date=1 March 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the young age of their target audience, Lucy Jones of ''[[The Independent]]'' said the Spice Girls' songs were subversive for their time: "The lyrics were active rather than passive: taking, grabbing, laying it down – all the things little girls were taught never to do. 'Stop right now, thank you very much'. 'Who do you think you are?' 'I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want'."&lt;ref name=lucyjones/&gt; [[Musicologist]] Nicola Dibben highlights "Say You'll Be There" as an example where the Spice Girls reversed traditional masculine and feminine roles, with the lyrics depicting a man who has fallen in love and displays too much emotion, while the woman remains independent and in control.&lt;ref name=dibben&gt;{{cite journal|title=Representations of Femininity in Popular Music|first=Nicola |last=Dibben|journal=Popular Music|volume=18|issue=3|date=October 1999|pages=331–355|doi=10.1017/S0261143000008904 |issn=0261-1430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the group emphasised the importance of sisterhood over romantic relationships in songs such as "Wannabe", and embraced [[safe sex]] in others like "2 Become 1".&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;

Lauren Bravo, author of ''What Would the Spice Girls Do?: How the Girl Power Generation Grew Up'' (2018), found that even when the group sang about romance, the message was "cheerfully non-committal" in contrast to the songs about "break-ups and unrequited love" other pop stars were singing at the time.&lt;ref name=bravo/&gt; Writing for ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'', Taylor Ferber praised the group's female-driven lyrics as being ahead of its time, highlighting the inclusivity and optimism of songs like "Spice Up Your Life", as well as the sex-positivity of "Last Time Lover" and "Naked". Ferber concluded: "Between all of their songs about friendship, sex, romance, and living life, a central theme in almost all Spice Girls music was loving yourself first."&lt;ref name=ferber/&gt;

===Vocal arrangements===
{{Quote
 |text = Five women in a band together, sharing songwriting credit and vocal duties equally, was a new concept in British pop in 1996.
 |source =  ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' in a retrospective review of ''[[Spice (album)|Spice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spice-girls-spice/|title=Spice Girls: Spice|first=Aimee|last=Cliff|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=19 May 2019|access-date=23 February 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210223155113/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spice-girls-spice/|archive-date=23 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In his book, David Sinclair described their vocal [[arrangement]]s as being "highly distinctive" from the pop vocal groups that had come before them. Instead of allocating a lead vocal line and having the other voices play a supporting role, the Spice Girls "maintained a strictly equal five-way split in the workload (and the glory)."&lt;ref name=sinclair200830&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group did not want any one member to be considered the lead singer—not even in one song—and so every song was divided up into one or two lines each, before all five voices harmonized together in the chorus. The group faced criticism for this aspect of their music as it meant that no one voice in a Spice Girls song could truly stand out, but Sinclair concluded that it "was actually a clever device to ensure that they gained the maximum impact and mileage from their all-in-it-together girl-gang image."&lt;ref name=sinclair200830/&gt;

The group's former vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, described their voices as being very distinct from each other and thus easy to pick out, such as the "lightness" of Bunton's voice and the "soulful sound" of Brown's and Chisholm's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Sean Smith singled out Chisholm's unique vocal style as the one voice the group could not do without.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2019|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair noted that while Chisholm's [[Ad libitum|ad lib]]s were often a distinctive feature of certain Spice Girls songs, ultimately the difference in the amount of time Chisholm's voice was featured over any other member of the group was negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While vocal time was distributed equally, musicologist Nicola Dibben found that there was an "interesting inequality" in the way that vocal styles were distributed within the group, which she felt conformed to certain stereotypes associated with race and socioeconomic background.&lt;ref name=dibben/&gt; According to Dibben, most of the declamatory style of singing in the group's singles were performed by Brown, the only black member, and Chisholm, who Dibben classified as "white working class"; this was in contrast to the more lyrical sections allotted to Beckham, who Dibben classified as "white middle class".&lt;ref name=dibben/&gt;

===Songwriting process===
The Spice Girls co-wrote all of their songs.&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085354/&gt;&lt;ref name=spicelinear&gt;''[[Spice (album)|Spice]]'' (liner notes). Spice Girls. Virgin Records. 1997. CDV2812.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiceworldlinear&gt;''[[Spiceworld (album)|Spiceworld]]'' (liner notes). Spice Girls. Virgin Records. 1997.

Virgin Records. 2000. 7243 8 50467 4 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to their frequent collaborator Richard Stannard, the group had two approaches to songwriting: [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] were written in a traditional way with everyone sitting around a piano, while songs such as "Wannabe" were the result of tapping into their "mad" energy.&lt;ref name=songwriters&gt;{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Barrett|title=Spice Girls: The singers' songwriters|work=[[Music Week]]|date=10 November 2007|page=20|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/232217960|issn=0265-1548|url-access=subscription|access-date=30 March 2021 |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliot Kennedy]], another regular co-writer, found that songwriting sessions with the Spice Girls could be "very quick and short".&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085354&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his experience working with them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
None of them played [[Musical instrument|instruments]], so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a [[refrain|chorus]]—check this out.' And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and straight away five pads and pencils came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later, the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few things here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Absolute's Paul Wilson recalled a similar experience whereby he and Watkins were responsible for writing the backing track and the group would then write the lyrics. Watkins added: "I wasn't an 18-year-old girl. They always had this weird ability to come up with phrases that you'd never heard of."&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085354/&gt; Wilson elaborated on the group's process: "The thing is when they wrote they were also writing the dance routine, constructing the video, all at the same time as writing the song."&lt;ref name=sinclair49/&gt; The duo found that they had no control over the music the Spice Girls wanted to make. Watkins explained: "They did what they did. They knew what they wanted to write about, right from Day One. You couldn't force your musical ideas upon them."&lt;ref name=sinclair49/&gt;

From the onset, the Spice Girls established a strict 50–50 split of the publishing [[royalties]] between them and their songwriting collaborators. As with their vocal arrangements, they were also adamant on maintaining parity between themselves in the songwriting credits.&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085152&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2008|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Adams, Brown, Bunton, Chisholm and Halliwell are collectively credited as "Spice Girls" in the songwriting credits for ''Spice'' and ''Spiceworld''.&lt;ref name=spicelinear/&gt;&lt;ref name=spiceworldlinear/&gt;}} Sinclair explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The deal between themselves was a strict five-way split on their share of the songwriting royalties ''on all songs'' irrespective of what any one member of the group had (or had not) contributed to any particular song. Apart from ease of administration, this was also a symbolic expression of the unity which was so much part and parcel of the Spice philosophy.&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085152/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sinclair identified Geri Halliwell as being a big source of ideas for the Spice Girls' songs. According to Sinclair, Halliwell came up with many of the concepts and starting points for the group's songs.&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085354/&gt; [[Tim Hawes]], who worked with the group when they were first starting out, said Halliwell's strength was in writing lyrics and pop [[Hook (music)|hooks]], and estimates that she was responsible for 60–70% of the lyrics in the songs he and the group worked on together.&lt;ref name=mcgibbon9798/&gt; On the other hand, the group's collaborators credit the other members of the group as being far more active than Halliwell in constructing the [[melodies]] and [[harmonies]] of their songs.&lt;ref name=mcgibbon9798/&gt;&lt;ref name=sinclair49/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085354/&gt; Matt Rowe, who wrote several songs with the Spice Girls, agreed that Halliwell was particularly good when it came to writing lyrics and credits the lyrics for "Viva Forever" to her. However, he felt that on balance all five members had contributed equally to the group's songwriting catalogue.&lt;ref name=Sinclair20085152/&gt;

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Pop music resurgence and girl group boom===
The Spice Girls broke onto the music scene at a time when [[alternative rock]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] dominated global music charts. In the group's first ever interview in May 1996, Halliwell told ''Music Week'': "We want to bring some of the glamour back to pop, like Madonna had when we were growing up. Pop is about fantasy and escapism, but there's so much bullshit around at the moment."&lt;ref name=firstinterview/&gt; The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early members of [[Millennials|Generation Y]] was credited with changing the music landscape by reviving the pop music genre,&lt;ref name="landscape"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/spice-girls-wannabe-was-number-1-20-years-ago-today__10051/|title=Spice Girls' Wannabe was Number 1 20 years ago today|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|last=Myers|first=Justin|date=5 July 2016|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210217171606/https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/spice-girls-wannabe-was-number-1-20-years-ago-today__10051/|archive-date=17 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/53567/the-90s-ranked/|title=Every Year of the '90s Ranked According to Music|publisher=[[VH1]]|date=12 August 2014|first=Stacy|last=Lambe|access-date=3 March 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210303122014/http://www.vh1.com/news/53567/the-90s-ranked/|archive-date=3 March 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Chuck|title=Britain's Spice Girls come to the rescue of ailing pop scene with the release of 'Spice'|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |date=15 February 1997|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing about the global wave of late-1990s and early-2000s [[teen pop]] acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[NSYNC]].&lt;ref name="teen pop"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/teen-pop-ma0000002895|title=Teen Pop|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210219133844/https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/teen-pop-ma0000002895|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop music"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/p/teenpop.htm|title=Teen Pop|publisher=[[About.com]]|first=Bill|last=Lamb|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210219134348/https://www.liveabout.com/teen-pop-meaning-3246993|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard wannabe video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/pop-shop/girl-group-week/6070253/top-10-girl-group-music-videos|title=Top 10 Most Iconic Girl Group Music Videos: 'Waterfalls,' 'Wannabe' &amp; More|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|date=4 March 2015|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210219144219/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/girl-group-week/6070253/top-10-girl-group-music-videos/|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spice girls ruined 1990s"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/1990s-spice-girls-celebrity-culture|title=The 1990s were the best of times ... until the Spice Girls ruined everything|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Sylvia|last=Patterson|date=4 July 2016|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210219134750/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/1990s-spice-girls-celebrity-culture|archive-date=19 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cool Britannia===

[[File:Geri Halliwell in concert cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Halliwell wearing a replica of her iconic [[Union Jack dress]]]] 
The term "[[Cool Britannia]]" became prominent in the media in the 1990s and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by [[New Labour]] and the new UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. Coming out of a period of 18 years of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and appealing, a driving force in giving Britain a feeling of euphoria and optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6766539.stm|title=Cool Britannia|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=21 June 2007|access-date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150203143152/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6766539.stm|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although by no means responsible for the onset of "Cool Britannia", the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than American, pop music. This fact was underlined at the [[1997 Brit Awards]]; the group won two awards&lt;ref name="brit 1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brits.co.uk/shows/1997/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418203744/http://brits.co.uk/shows/1997/|title=The BRIT Awards 1997|publisher=[[Brit Awards]]|access-date=11 March 2006|archive-date=18 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was Halliwell's iconic red, white and blue Union Jack mini-dress that appeared in media coverage around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2019|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming an enduring image of "Cool Britannia".&lt;ref name="dress poll"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Alexander|authorlink=Hilary Alexander|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG7740201/Online-poll-announces-the-top-ten-most-iconic-dresses-of-the-past-fifty-years.html|title=Online poll announces the top ten most iconic dresses of the past fifty years|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=19 May 2010|access-date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708053349/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG7740201/Online-poll-announces-the-top-ten-most-iconic-dresses-of-the-past-fifty-years.html|archive-date=8 July 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201202027142/geri-halliwell-launches-new-union-jack-range/|title=Geri revisits Spice Girls' heyday in Union Jack dress|date=2 February 2012|work=[[Hello!

===Image, nicknames and fashion trends===
The Spice Girls' image was deliberately aimed at young girls, an audience of formidable size and potential. Instrumental to their range of appeal within this demographic was their five distinct personalities and styles, which encouraged fans to identify with one member or another. This rejection of a homogeneous group identity was a stark departure from previous groups such as the Beatles and [[the Supremes]],&lt;ref name="spice girls legacy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36714177|title=How the Spice effect still packs punch|publisher=[[BBC News]]|first=John|last=McKie|date=6 July 2016|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210223231710/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36714177|archive-date=23 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brian masters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9709663/Brian-Masters-Why-I-love-the-Spice-Girls.html|title=Why I love the Spice Girls|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 November 2012|access-date=9 February 2017|last=Masters|first=Brian|author-link=Brian Masters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228115517/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9709663/Brian-Masters-Why-I-love-the-Spice-Girls.html|archive-date=28 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bravo|2018a|loc=chpt. 1|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Spice Girls model has since been used to style other pop groups such as [[One Direction]].&lt;ref name="1D"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/one-direction-styled-look-male-equivalent-spice-girls-10082823.html|title=One Direction's style was inspired by the Spice Girls|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Emma|last=Akbareian|date=3 March 2015|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210224090045/https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/one-direction-styled-look-male-equivalent-spice-girls-10082823.html|archive-date=24 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1D style"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://themuse.jezebel.com/behind-the-boy-band-q-a-with-caroline-watson-one-dire-1687594935|title=Behind the Boy Band: Q&amp;A with Caroline Watson, One Direction's Stylist|work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|first=Brodie|last=Lancaster|date=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210224090531/https://themuse.jezebel.com/behind-the-boy-band-q-a-with-caroline-watson-one-dire-1687594935|access-date=19 February 2017|archive-date=24 February 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's image was inadvertently bolstered by the nicknames bestowed on them by the British press. After a lunch with the Spice Girls in the wake of "Wannabe{{" '}}s release, Peter Loraine, the then-editor of ''[[Top of the Pops (magazine)|Top of the Pops]]'' magazine, and his editorial staff decided to devise nicknames for each member of the group based on their personalities. Loraine explained, "In the magazine we used silly language and came up with nicknames all the time so it came naturally to give them names that would be used by the magazine and its readers; it was never meant to be adopted globally."&lt;ref name="Intent Media"/&gt; Shortly after using the nicknames in a magazine feature on the group, Loraine received calls from other British media outlets requesting permission to use them, and before long the nicknames were synonymous with the Spice Girls.&lt;ref name="Intent Media"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=Christopher|title=Spice Girls: From Wannabes to World Beaters|work=[[Music Week]]|date=10 November 2007|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/232226522/|issn=0265-1548|url-access=subscription|page=13|access-date=23 February 2021 |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="girl power 3"/&gt; Jennifer Cawthron, one of the magazine's staff writers, explained how the nicknames were chosen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Victoria was 'Posh Spice', because she was wearing a [[Gucci]]-style mini dress and seemed pouty and reserved. Emma wore [[pigtail]]s and sucked a lollipop, so obviously she was 'Baby Spice'. Mel C spent the whole time leaping around in her [[tracksuit]], so we called her 'Sporty Spice'. I named Mel B 'Scary Spice' because she was so shouty. And Geri was 'Ginger Spice', simply because of her hair. Not much thought went into that one.&lt;ref name="girl power 3"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2020 interview, Chisholm explained that the Spice Girls' image came about unintentionally when, after initially trying to coordinate their outfits as was expected of girl groups at the time, the group decided to just dress in their own individual styles. According to Chisholm, they "never thought too much more of it" until after "Wannabe" was released and the press gave them their nicknames. The group embraced the nicknames and grew into caricatures of themselves, which Chisholm said was "like a protection mechanism because it was like putting on this armour of being this, this character, rather than it actually being you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/melanie-c-imagines-how-the-spice-girls-would-fare-in-2020|title=Melanie C Imagines How The Spice Girls Would Fare In 2020|work=[[Love (magazine)|Love]]|date=2 April 2020|first=Amelia|last=White|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210314085742/https://www.thelovemagazine.co.uk/article/melanie-c-imagines-how-the-spice-girls-would-fare-in-2020|archive-date=14 March 2021|access-date=14 March 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of the group's enduring influence on 21st-century [[popular culture]], John Mckie of the [[BBC]] observed that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, "the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band".&lt;ref name="spice girls legacy"/&gt; Christopher Barrett and Ben Cardew of ''[[Music Week]]'' credited Fuller's "ground-breaking" strategy of marketing the Spice Girls as a brand with revolutionising the pop music industry, "paving the way for everything from [[The White Stripes]] cameras to [[U2]] iPods and [[Girls Aloud]] phones."&lt;ref name=spicebrand&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=Christopher|last2=Cardew|first2=Ben|title=Spice Girls: The power of Brand Spice|work=[[Music Week]]|date=10 November 2007|page=22|issn=02651548|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/232153193|url-access=subscription|access-date=28 March 2021 |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett further noted that pop music and brand synergy have become inextricably linked in the modern music industry, which he attributed to the "remarkable" impact of the Spice Girls.&lt;ref name="Intent Media"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the group's true legacy: "[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since."&lt;ref name="spice girls ruined 1990s"/&gt;

The [[mainstream media]] embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success. The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi.&lt;ref name="Sinclair 2004, pp. 115–116"&gt;{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Gorman]] of ''Music Week'' said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s: "They inaugurated the era of cheesy [[celebrity culture|celebrity obsession]] which pertains today. There is lineage from them to the [[Kim Kardashian|Kardashian]]isation not only of the music industry, but the wider culture."&lt;ref name="spice girls legacy"/&gt; The ''[[Irish Independent]]''{{'s}} Tanya Sweeney agreed that "[t]he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls' naked ambitions",&lt;ref name="spice girls feminism"/&gt; while Mckie predicted that, "[f]or all that modern stars from [[Katy Perry]] to [[Lionel Messi]] exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage, the scale of the Spice Girls' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated—at least not by a music act."&lt;ref name="spice girls legacy"/&gt;

Parodies of the Spice Girls have also appeared in major [[advertising campaign]]s. In 1997, [[Jack in the Box]], an American fast-food chain restaurant, sought to capitalise on "Spice mania" in America by launching a national television campaign using a fictional girl group called the [[Jack in the Box#Advertising|Spicy Crispy Chicks]] (a take off of the Spice Girls) to promote the new Spicy Crispy Sandwich. The Spicy Crispy Chicks concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the 'Meaty Cheesy Boys'.&lt;ref name="eonline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web|work=4-traders|title=Jack in Box : Spice Girls Classic album|url=http://www.4-traders.com/JACK-IN-THE-BOX-INC-4947359/news/Jack-in-Box-Spice-Girls-Classic-album-23386894/}}

Other notable groups of people have been labelled as some variation of a [[play-on-words]] on the Spice Girls' name as an allusion to the band.
