Fascists saw World War I as a [[revolution]] that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of [[total war]] and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A "military citizenship" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65"&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Mann | title=Fascists | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=Cambridge, England|year=2004 | isbn=978-0521831314|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65"/&gt;

Fascists believe that [[liberal democracy]] is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Horne|title=State, Society and Mobilization in Europe During the First World War|date=8 August 2002|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=978-0521522663|pages=237–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fascist state is led by a strong leader such as a [[dictator]] and a [[martial law]] government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views [[imperialism]], political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.&lt;ref name="Grčić-Routledge-Spielvogel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley G.

Since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist, and the term is instead now usually used [[Fascist (insult)|pejoratively]] by political opponents. The descriptions [[neo-fascist]] or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe contemporary parties of the far-right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeCompanion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/neofascismo/|title=Neofascismo|publisher=Enciclopedia Italiana|language=it|date=31 October 2014|access-date=31 October 2014|archive-date=6 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106235833/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/neofascismo/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The Italian term ''fascismo'' is derived from ''fascio'', meaning 'bundle of sticks', ultimately from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[fasces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism|title=Definition of FASCISM|dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]]|date=27 April 2013|access-date=28 April 2013|archive-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430131406/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as [[fasci]], groups similar to [[guild]]s or [[syndicate]]s. According to Italian fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s own account, the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasces of Revolutionary Action]] were founded in Italy in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Benito|last=Mussolini|author-link=Benito Mussolini|orig-year=1928|date=2006|title=My Autobiography with The Political and Social Doctrine of Fascism|location=Mineloa, New York|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0486447773|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Mussolini founded the [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Italian Fasces of Combat]] in Milan, which became the [[National Fascist Party]] two years later. The Fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or ''[[fascio littorio]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simonetta|last=Falasca-Zamponi|title=Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Oakland, California|date=2000|isbn=978-0520226777|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a bundle of rods tied around an axe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okwu.edu/keating-center/2013/04/the-rule-of-law-symbols-of-power/|title=The Rule of Law: Symbols of Power|last=Johnston|first=Peter|work=The Keating Center|publisher=[[Oklahoma Wesleyan University]]|date=12 April 2013|access-date=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330232643/http://www.okwu.edu/keating-center/2013/04/the-rule-of-law-symbols-of-power/|archive-date=30 March 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbol of the authority of the civic [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/page.cfm?siteID=78&amp;pageID=35|title=Policing Rome: Maintaining Order in Fact and Fiction|last=Watkins|first=Tom|work=Fictional Rome|publisher=[[Stockton University]]|location=Stockton, New Jersey|year=2013|access-date=28 April 2013|archive-date=16 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316011914/http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/page.cfm?siteID=78&amp;pageID=35|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried by his [[lictor]]s, which could be used for [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] and [[capital punishment]] at his command.&lt;ref name="Webster's II New College Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paynee"/&gt;

The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break.&lt;ref name="In the Shadow of the Fasces: Political Design in Fascist Italy"/&gt; Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements: for example, the [[Falange]] symbol is five arrows joined together by a yoke.&lt;ref name="Fashioning the Body Politic: Dress, Gender, Citizenship"/&gt;

== Definitions ==
{{Main|Definitions of fascism}}
Historians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism.&lt;ref name="phoenix" /&gt;  Indeed, historian [[Ian Kershaw]] once wrote that "trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hellback| page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.&lt;ref name="deff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligentguide"/&gt;

According to many scholars, fascism &amp;ndash; especially once in power &amp;ndash; has historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far right.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, 1996 p. 223; Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History.'' 1996, p. 39; Griffin, 1991, 2000, pp. 185–201; Weber, [1964] 1982, p. 8; Payne (1995), Fritzsche (1990), Laclau (1977), and Reich (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

One common definition of the term, frequently cited by reliable sources as a standard definition, is that of historian [[Stanley G. Payne]].&lt;ref name="deff"/&gt; He focuses on three concepts:

# the "fascist negations": [[anti-liberalism]], [[anti-communism]], and anti-[[conservatism]];
# "fascist goals": the creation of a nationalist dictatorship to regulate economic structure and to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture, and the expansion of the nation into an empire; and
# "fascist style": a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence, and promotion of masculinity, youth, and charismatic authoritarian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Prebble Q. Ramswell|title=Euroscepticism and the Rising Threat from the Left and Right: The Concept of Millennial Fascism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wNBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=2017|publisher=Lexington Books|page=9|isbn=9781498546041|access-date=8 March 2019|archive-date=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331123505/https://books.google.com/books?id=_wNBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aristotle4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="practice"/&gt;

Professor [[Jason Stanley]], in his book ''[[How Fascism Works|How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them]]'', observed that "The leader proposes that only he can solve it and all of his political opponents are enemies or traitors." Stanley says recent global events {{Asof|2020|lc=y}}, including the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]] and the [[2020–2021 United States racial unrest|protests]], have substantiated his concern about how fascist rhetoric is showing up in politics and policies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Christianna |title=Fascism Scholar Says U.S. Is 'Losing Its Democratic Status' |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/09/06/910320018/fascism-scholar-says-u-s-is-losing-its-democratic-status |website=NPR.org |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=7 September 2020 |archive-date=7 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907010731/https://www.npr.org/2020/09/06/910320018/fascism-scholar-says-u-s-is-losing-its-democratic-status |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[John Lukacs]] argues that there is no such thing as generic fascism. He claims that [[Nazism]] and [[communism]] are essentially manifestations of [[populism]] and that states such as Nazi Germany and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] are more different than similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Lukacs|title=The Hitler of History|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York City|date=1998|isbn=978-0375701139|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Griffin]] describes fascism as "a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a [[palingenesis|palingenetic]] form of populist [[ultranationalism]]".&lt;ref name="Griffin 1993 27"&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger|last=Griffin|author-link=Roger Griffin|title=The Nature of Fascism|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|date=1993|isbn=978-0415096614|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin describes the ideology as having three core components: "(i) the rebirth myth, (ii) populist ultra-nationalism, and (iii) the myth of decadence".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; In Griffin's view, fascism is "a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism" built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguishes an inter-war period in which it manifested itself in elite-led but populist "armed party" politics opposing socialism and liberalism and promising radical politics to rescue the nation from decadence.&lt;ref name="brookes" /&gt; In ''Against the Fascist Creep'', [[Alexander Reid Ross]] writes regarding Griffin's view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Following the [[Cold War]] and shifts in fascist organizing techniques, a number of scholars have moved toward the minimalist "new consensus" refined by Roger Griffin: "the mythic core" of fascism is "a populist form of [[palingenetic ultranationalism]]." That means that fascism is an ideology that draws on old, ancient, and even arcane myths of racial, cultural, ethnic, and national origins to develop a plan for the "new man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxWETFV39dCpalpxT2o5N0J2Z0U/view|title=Against the Fascist Creep|publisher=[[AK Press]]|location=Chico, California|first=Alexander Reid|last=Ross|author-link=Alexander Reid Ross|year=2017|page=5|isbn=9781849352444|access-date=31 July 2019|archive-date=31 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731031829/https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxWETFV39dCpalpxT2o5N0J2Z0U/view|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, Griffin himself explored this 'mythic' or 'eliminable' core of fascism with his concept of ''post-fascism'' to explore the continuation of Nazism in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Fascist Century|first1=Roger|last1=Griffin|author-link1=Roger Griffin|editor-first1=Matthew|editor-last1=Feldman|date=2008|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=London, England|isbn=978-0-230-20518-5|chapter=8: Fascism’s New Faces (and New Facelessness) in the 'Post-Fascist' Epoch|oclc=226357121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, other historians have applied this minimalist core to explore ''proto-fascist'' movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roel Reyes|first=Stefan|date=December 17, 2019|title=Antebellum Palingenetic Ultranationalism: The Case for including the United States in Comparative Fascist Studies|journal=Fascism|publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]]|location=Leiden, Netherlands|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=307–330|doi=10.1163/22116257-00802005|issn=2211-6257|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cas Mudde]] and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser argue that although fascism "flirted with populism ... in an attempt to generate mass support", it is better seen as an elitist ideology. They cite in particular its exaltation of the Leader, the race, and the state, rather than the people. They see populism as a "thin-centered ideology" with a "restricted morphology" that necessarily becomes attached to "thick-centered" ideologies such as fascism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus populism can be found as an aspect of many specific ideologies, without necessarily being a defining characteristic of those ideologies. They refer to the combination of populism, authoritarianism and ultranationalism as "a marriage of convenience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mudde |first1=Cas |author-link1=Cas Mudde|last2=Kaltwasser |first2=Cristóbal Rovira |title=Populism: A Very Short Introduction |location=Oxford, England|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2017 |isbn=9780190234874 |pages=6, 33–34|quote=...thin-centered ideologies have a restricted morphology, which necessarily appears attached to &amp;ndash; and sometimes is even assimilated into &amp;ndash; other ideologies. In fact, populism almost always appears attached to other ideological elements, which are crucial for the promotion of political projects that are appealing to a broader public. Consequently, by itself populism can offer neither complex nor comprehensive answers to the political questions that modern sociiwties generate. ... [Populism] is not so much a coherent ideological tradition as a set of ideas that, in the real world, appears in combination with quite different, and sometimes contradictory, ideologies. (p.6)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Paxton]] says that:

{{quote|[Fascism is] a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.&lt;ref name="anatomnyfascismo" /&gt;}}

Racism was a key feature of German fascism, for which the [[Holocaust]] was a high priority.

Historian [[Robert Soucy]] stated that "Hitler envisioned the ideal German society as a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'', a racially unified and hierarchically organized body in which the interests of individuals would be strictly subordinate to those of the nation, or Volk."&lt;ref&gt;"Volksgemeinschaft" in [https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Volksgemeinschaft#ref742146 ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (2019)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331074936/https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Volksgemeinschaft#ref742146 |date=31 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist philosophies vary by application, but remain distinct by one theoretical commonality: all traditionally fall into the far-right sector of any [[political spectrum]], catalyzed by afflicted class identities over conventional social inequities.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeCompanion"/&gt;

=== Position in the political spectrum ===
Most scholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeCompanion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University-Aristotle-Hartley-Wilhelm-Hawkesworth"/&gt; Such scholarship focuses on its [[social conservatism]] and its authoritarian means of opposing [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modern Free Society and Its Nemesis: Liberty Versus Conservatism in the New Millennium"/&gt; Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he says is "a radical variant of fascism"—on the political right by explaining: "The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be".&lt;ref name="google6"/&gt;

Fascism's origins, however, are complex and include many seemingly contradictory viewpoints, ultimately centered around a mythos of national rebirth from decadence.&lt;ref name="ah.brookes.ac.uk"&gt;Griffin, Roger: "The Palingenetic Core of Fascism", ''Che cos'è il fascismo? Interpretazioni e prospettive di ricerche'', Ideazione editrice, Rome, 2003 [http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf AH.Brookes.ac.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120193621/http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/coreoffascism.pdf |date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism was founded during [[World War I]] by Italian [[National syndicalism|national syndicalists]] who drew upon both [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] organizational tactics and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political views.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time'', New Brunswick: NJ, Transaction Press, 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian Fascism]] gravitated to the right in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="ZeevSternhell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massachusetts"/&gt; A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far-right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements.&lt;ref name="Oliver H. Woshinsky 2008. p. 156"/&gt;

In the 1920s, the Italian Fascists described their ideology as right-wing in the political program ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]'', stating: "We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century".&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Thompson Schnapp 2000, p. 57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benito Mussolini 1935, p. 26"/&gt; Mussolini stated that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: "Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center&amp;nbsp;... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words".&lt;ref name="Gentile, Emilio 2005. p. 205"/&gt;

Major Italian groups politically on the right, especially rich landowners and big business, feared an uprising by groups on the left such as sharecroppers and labour unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zygmunt G. Baranski|author2=Rebecca J.

The "Fascist left" included [[Michele Bianchi]], [[Giuseppe Bottai]], [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]], [[Sergio Panunzio]], and [[Edmondo Rossoni]], who were committed to advancing national syndicalism as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism in order to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and the common people.&lt;ref name="sgp112" /&gt; The "Fascist right" included members of the paramilitary ''Squadristi'' and former members of the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI).&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt; The ''Squadristi'' wanted to establish Fascism as a complete dictatorship, while the former ANI members, including [[Alfredo Rocco]], sought to institute an authoritarian corporatist state to replace the liberal state in Italy while retaining the existing elites.&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt; Upon accommodating the political right, there arose a group of monarchist fascists who sought to use fascism to create an [[absolute monarchy]] under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt;

After the [[fall of the Fascist regime in Italy]], when King Victor Emmanuel III forced Mussolini to resign as head of government and placed him under arrest in 1943, Mussolini was rescued by German forces. While continuing to rely on Germany for support, Mussolini and the remaining loyal Fascists founded the [[Italian Social Republic]] with Mussolini as head of state. Mussolini sought to re-radicalize Italian Fascism, declaring that the Fascist state had been overthrown because Italian Fascism had been subverted by Italian conservatives and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name="ballbellamy1"&gt;Terence Ball, Richard Bellamy. ''The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought''. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the new Fascist government proposed the creation of workers' councils and profit-sharing in industry, although the German authorities, who effectively controlled northern Italy at this point, ignored these measures and did not seek to enforce them.&lt;ref name="ballbellamy1"/&gt;

A number of post-World War II fascist movements described themselves as a "[[Third Position|third position]]" outside the traditional political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;"Transcending the beyond: from Third Position to National-Anarchism", Troy Southgate, ed. Griffin (Routeledge) 2003, pp. 377–82&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangist]] leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] said: "[B]asically the Right stands for the maintenance of an economic structure, albeit an unjust one, while the Left stands for the attempt to subvert that economic structure, even though the subversion thereof would entail the destruction of much that was worthwhile".&lt;ref name="nm54"/&gt;

=== "Fascist" as a pejorative ===
{{Main|Fascist (insult)}}
The term "fascist" has been used as a [[pejorative]],&lt;ref name="intellectuals"/&gt; regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="orwell1944"/&gt; [[George Orwell]] wrote in 1944 that "the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless&amp;nbsp;... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="orwell1944"/&gt;

Despite fascist movements' history of anti-communism, [[communist state]]s have sometimes been referred to as "fascist", typically as an insult. For example, it has been applied to [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] regimes in [[Cuba]] under [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]].&lt;ref name="rg231"/&gt; Chinese Marxists used the term to denounce the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], and likewise the Soviets used the term to denounce Chinese Marxists&lt;ref name="quarantotto"/&gt; and [[social democracy]] (coining a new term in "[[social fascism]]").

In the [[United States]], Herbert Matthews of ''[[The New York Times]]'' asked in 1946: "Should we now place Stalinist Russia in the same category as Hitlerite Germany? Should we say that she is Fascist?".&lt;ref name="matthews"/&gt; [[J. Edgar Hoover]], longtime [[FBI]] director and ardent anti-communist, wrote extensively of "Red Fascism".&lt;ref name="milestonedocuments"/&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s was sometimes called "fascist". Historian Peter Amann states that, "Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism—chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism—yet their differences were fundamental ... [the KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Amann, "A 'Dog in the Nighttime' Problem: American Fascism in the 1930s," ''History Teacher'' 19#4 (1986), pp. 559–84 {{JSTOR|493879}} at p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th-century roots ===
[[Georges Valois]], founder of the first non-Italian fascist party [[Faisceau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sternhell|first=Zeev|date=1976|title=Anatomie d'un mouvement fasciste en France : le faisceau de Georges Valois|journal=Revue française de science politique|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–40|doi=10.3406/rfsp.1976.393652}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed the roots of fascism stemmed from the late 18th century [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] movement, seeing in its totalitarian nature a foreshadowing of the fascist state.&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ|title=Far-Right Politics in Europe|last1=Camus|first1=Jean-Yves|last2=Lebourg|first2=Nicolas|date=2017-03-20|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674971530|pages=20|language=en|access-date=9 May 2020|archive-date=9 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609024851/https://books.google.com/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[George Mosse]] similarly analyzed fascism as an inheritor of the [[Mass movement|mass ideology]] and [[civil religion]] of the [[French Revolution]], as well as a result of the brutalization of societies in 1914–1918.&lt;ref name="Camus"/&gt;

Historians such as [[Irene Collins]] and Howard C Payne see [[Napoleon III]], who ran a 'police state' and suppressed the media, as a forerunner of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Lawrence Williams]], ''The Mortal Napoleon The Third'', Princeton University Press, 2015, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Thomson (historian)|David Thomson]],&lt;ref&gt;David Thomson, ''Europe Since Napoleon'', Pelican, 1966, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Risorgimento]] of 1871 led to the 'nemesis of fascism'. [[William L Shirer]]&lt;ref&gt;William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Mandarin, 1960, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; sees a continuity from the views of [[Fichte]] and [[Hegel]], through [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], to Hitler; [[Robert Gerwarth]] speaks of a 'direct line' from Bismarck to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gerwarth, ''The Bismarck Myth'', Oxford University Press have, 2005, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Dierkes sees fascism as a 'particularly violent form of [[imperialism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Dierkes, ''Postwar Historical Education in Japan and the Germanies'', Routledge, 2010, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Fin de siècle'' era and the fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880–1914) ===
The historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' theme of that time.&lt;ref name="international" /&gt;&lt;ref name="routledge12" /&gt; The theme was based on a revolt against [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[positivism]], bourgeois society and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170" /&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' generation supported [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]], [[irrationalism]], [[subjectivism]] and [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name="routledge13" /&gt; They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt; They condemned the rationalistic individualism of liberal society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170"/&gt;

The ''fin-de-siècle'' outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[biology]]; [[Gesamtkunstwerk|Wagnerian aesthetics]]; [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s racialism; [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s [[psychology]]; and the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171" /&gt; Social Darwinism, which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life, and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the [[survival of the fittest]].&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Social Darwinism challenged positivism's claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race, and environment.&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Social Darwinism's emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered the legitimacy and appeal of nationalism.&lt;ref name="routledge14" /&gt; New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason.&lt;ref name="Zeev 1998 p. 171"/&gt; Nietzsche's argument that "God is dead" coincided with his attack on the "herd mentality" of [[Christianity]], democracy and modern collectivism; his concept of the ''[[übermensch]]''; and his advocacy of the [[will to power]] as a primordial instinct, were major influences upon many of the ''fin-de-siècle'' generation.&lt;ref name="routledge15"/&gt; Bergson's claim of the existence of an "''élan vital''" or vital instinct centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism; this challenged Marxism.&lt;ref name="routledge16"/&gt;

[[Gaetano Mosca]] in his work ''The Ruling Class'' (1896) developed the theory that claims that in all societies an "organized minority" will dominate and rule over the "disorganized majority".&lt;ref name="William Outhwaite 2006. p. 442"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy H. Koon 1943. p. 6"/&gt; Mosca claims that there are only two classes in society, "the governing" (the organized minority) and "the governed" (the disorganized majority).&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. p. 12"/&gt; He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.&lt;ref name="Giuseppe Caforio 2006. p. 12"/&gt;

[[French nationalism|French nationalist]] and reactionary monarchist [[Charles Maurras]] influenced fascism.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt; Maurras promoted what he called [[integral nationalism]], which called for the organic unity of a nation, and insisted that a powerful monarch was an ideal leader of a nation. Maurras distrusted what he considered the democratic mystification of the popular will that created an impersonal collective subject.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt; He claimed that a powerful monarch was a personified sovereign who could exercise authority to unite a nation's people.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt; Maurras' integral nationalism was idealized by fascists, but modified into a modernized revolutionary form that was devoid of Maurras' monarchism.&lt;ref name="nationalism18"/&gt;

French revolutionary syndicalist [[Georges Sorel]] promoted the legitimacy of [[political violence]] in his work ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'' (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a [[general strike]].&lt;ref name="mobilization21" /&gt; In ''Reflections on Violence'', Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary [[political religion]].&lt;ref name="mobilization22" /&gt; Also in his work ''The Illusions of Progress'', Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying "nothing is more aristocratic than democracy".&lt;ref name="mobilization23" /&gt; By 1909 after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="mobilization24" /&gt; Initially Sorel had officially been a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that "socialism is dead" because of the "decomposition of Marxism".&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78" /&gt; Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works.&lt;ref name="Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78"/&gt; Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] [[syndicalism]] as a means to confront democracy.&lt;ref name="revolution1994" /&gt; Maurras stated "a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand".&lt;ref name="multiculturalism" /&gt;

[[File:EnricoCorradini.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Enrico Corradini]] ]]
The fusion of Maurrassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]].&lt;ref name="zs163" /&gt; Corradini spoke of the need for a nationalist-syndicalist movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight.&lt;ref name=zs163/&gt; Corradini spoke of Italy as being a "proletarian nation" that needed to pursue imperialism in order to challenge the "[[Plutocracy|plutocratic]]" French and British.&lt;ref name="mb9" /&gt; Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing Italian Nationalist Association (ANI), which claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by:

* corruption in its political class, 
* [[liberalism]], and 
* division caused by "ignoble socialism".&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt;

The ANI held ties and influence among [[Conservatism|conservatives]], Catholics and the business community.&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of [[bourgeois]] values, democracy, liberalism, [[Marxism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and [[pacifism]]; and the promotion of [[heroism]], vitalism and violence.&lt;ref name="revolution" /&gt;
The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world, and advocated a strong state and imperialism. They believed that humans are naturally predatory, and that nations are in a constant struggle in which only the strongest would survive.&lt;ref name="nationalism25" /&gt;

[[File:Manifesto of Futurism.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], Italian modernist author of the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1909) and later the co-author of the ''[[Fascist Manifesto]]'' (1919)]]
Futurism was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] who founded the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action, and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy based on majority rule and egalitarianism, for a new form of democracy, promoting what he described in his work "The Futurist Conception of Democracy" as the following:
{{quote|We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to numbers, to quantity, to the mass, for with us number, quantity and mass will never be—as they are in Germany and Russia—the number, quantity and mass of mediocre men, incapable and indecisive".&lt;ref name="aesthetics" /&gt;}}

Futurism influenced fascism in its emphasis on recognizing the virile nature of violent action and war as being necessities of modern civilization.&lt;ref name="Gigliola Gori 2004. p. 14"&gt;Gigliola Gori. ''Italian Fascism and the Female Body: Submissive Women and Strong Mothers''. Oxfordshire; New York: Routledge, 2004. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti promoted the need of physical training of young men saying that, in male education, gymnastics should take precedence over books. He advocated segregation of the genders because womanly sensibility must not enter men's education, which he claimed must be "lively, bellicose, muscular and violently dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;Gigliola Gori. ''Italian Fascism and the Female Body: Submissive Women and Strong Mothers''. Oxfordshire; New York: Routledge, 2004. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War I and its aftermath (1914–1929) ===
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism.&lt;ref name="zs175" /&gt; Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist [[fascio]] called the [[Fascio Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista|Revolutionary Fasces of International Action]] in October 1914.&lt;ref name=zs175/&gt; Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'' for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio.&lt;ref name="revolution27" /&gt; The term "Fascism" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action.&lt;ref name="journalist" /&gt;

The first meeting of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action was held on 24 January 1915&lt;ref name="Paul O p. 41"&gt;Paul O'Brien.

Similar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist [[Johann Plenge]] spoke of the rise of a "National Socialism" in Germany within what he termed the "ideas of 1914" that were a declaration of war against the "ideas of 1789" (the French Revolution).&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205" /&gt; According to Plenge, the "ideas of 1789"—such as the rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism—were being rejected in favor of "the ideas of 1914" that included "German values" of duty, discipline, law and order.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205"/&gt; Plenge believed that racial solidarity (''Volksgemeinschaft'') would replace class division and that "racial comrades" would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of "proletarian" Germany against "capitalist" Britain.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205"/&gt; He believed that the "[[Spirit of 1914]]" manifested itself in the concept of the "People's League of National Socialism".&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92" /&gt; This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the "idea of boundless freedom" and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state.&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92"/&gt; This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against "the national interest" of Germany but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy.&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CritTheory /&gt; Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic]] state.&lt;ref name="Thomas Rohkrämer 2007. p. 130" /&gt;

==== Impact of World War I ====
Fascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of [[total war]] and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a "military citizenship" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65"/&gt; World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann65" /&gt; Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with [[mass politics]], technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

[[File:Italian Arditi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Members of Italy's ''[[Arditi]]'' corps (here in 1918 holding daggers, a symbol of their group), which was formed in 1917 as groups of soldiers trained for dangerous missions, characterized by refusal to surrender and willingness to fight to the death. Their black uniforms inspired those of the Italian Fascist movement.]]

==== Impact of the Bolshevik Revolution ====
The [[October Revolution]] of 1917—in which [[Bolshevik]] communists led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] seized power in Russia—greatly influenced the development of fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96" /&gt; In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas.&lt;ref name="Peter Neville 2004. p. 36" /&gt; After World War I, fascists commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt;

Liberal opponents of both fascism and the Bolsheviks argue that there are various similarities between the two, including that they believed in the necessity of a vanguard leadership, had disdain for bourgeois values and it is argued had totalitarian ambitions.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states and party-armies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96"/&gt; However, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an [[Soviet democracy|organized participatory democracy]] and an egalitarian, [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] vision for society while the fascists emphasize [[hyper-nationalism]] and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims.

With the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist Fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The Fascists presented themselves as [[Anti-communism|anti-Marxists]] and as opposed to the Marxists.&lt;ref name="revolution28" /&gt; Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement, known as [[Sansepolcrismo]], in 1919 with the founding of the ''Italian Fasces of Combat''.

==== ''Fascist Manifesto'' of 1919 ====
In 1919, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created ''[[Fascist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat]]'' (the ''Fascist Manifesto'').&lt;ref name="connecticut30" /&gt; The ''Manifesto'' was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia''. The ''Manifesto'' supported the creation of [[universal suffrage]] for both men [[women's suffrage|and women]] (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded);&lt;ref name="passmore" /&gt; [[proportional representation]] on a regional basis; government representation through a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system of "National Councils" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, communications, etc.; and the abolition of the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy|Italian Senate]].&lt;ref name="massachusetts31" /&gt; The ''Manifesto'' supported the creation of an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for all workers, a [[minimum wage]], worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong [[progressive tax]] on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits.&lt;ref name="massachusetts32" /&gt; It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paxton |first1=Robert |title=The Anatomy of Fascism |date=2005 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-307-42812-7 |edition=First Vintage Books |chapter=Chapter 1, The Invention of Fascism}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, [[nationalization]] of the armaments industry and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive.&lt;ref name="massachusetts33" /&gt;

[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Residents of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] cheer the arrival of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and his blackshirt-wearing nationalist raiders, as D'Annunzio and Fascist [[Alceste De Ambris]] developed the quasi-fascist [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] (a city-state in Fiume) from 1919 to 1920 and whose actions by D'Annunzio in Fiume inspired the Italian Fascist movement.]]

The next events that influenced the Fascists in Italy was the raid of [[Fiume (city)|Fiume]] by Italian nationalist [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and the founding of the [[Charter of Carnaro]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="revolution34" /&gt; D'Annunzio and De Ambris designed the Charter, which advocated national-syndicalist corporatist [[productionism]] alongside D'Annunzio's political views.&lt;ref name="revolution35" /&gt; Many Fascists saw the Charter of Carnaro as an ideal constitution for a Fascist Italy.&lt;ref name="zs189" /&gt; This behaviour of aggression towards Yugoslavia and [[South Slavs]] was pursued by Italian Fascists with their persecution of South Slavs—especially Slovenes and Croats.

==== Italian Fascists in 1920 ====
In 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the [[Biennio Rosso|"Red Years"]].&lt;ref name="massachusetts36" /&gt; Mussolini and the Fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.&lt;ref name="massachusetts37" /&gt;

Fascists identified their primary opponents as the majority of socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I.&lt;ref name=zs189/&gt; The Fascists and the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites.&lt;ref name="zs193" /&gt; The Fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.&lt;ref name=zs193/&gt;

Fascism sought to accommodate Italian conservatives by making major alterations to its political agenda—abandoning its previous populism, [[republicanism]] and [[anticlericalism]], adopting policies in support of [[free enterprise]] and accepting the [[Catholic Church]] and the monarchy as institutions in Italy.&lt;ref name="ga145" /&gt; To appeal to Italian conservatives, Fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce—limiting the woman's role to that of a mother. The fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.&lt;ref name="conservatives" /&gt;

Though Fascism adopted a number of anti-modern positions designed to appeal to people upset with the new trends in sexuality and women's rights—especially those with a [[reactionary]] point of view—the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying: "Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary".&lt;ref name="revolution38" /&gt; The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.&lt;ref name="conservatives39" /&gt;

Prior to Fascism's accommodations to the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members.&lt;ref name="massachusetts40" /&gt; After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.&lt;ref name="massachusetts41" /&gt;

==== Fascist violence in 1922 ====
Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and the homes of socialist leadership figures, to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities.&lt;ref name="rop87"/&gt; The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Benito Mussolini]] with three of the four [[quadrumvirs]] during the [[March on Rome]] (from left to right: unknown, [[Emilio de Bono|de Bono]], Mussolini, [[Italo Balbo|Balbo]] and [[Cesare Maria de Vecchi|de Vecchi]])]]
On 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in [[Naples]], where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances.&lt;ref name="rop88" /&gt; King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.&lt;ref name="rop90" /&gt; Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment.&lt;ref name=rop90/&gt; Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as "[[March on Rome]]", as a "seizure" of power because of Fascists' heroic exploits.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

=== Fascist Italy ===
Historian Stanley G. Payne says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Fascism in Italy was a] primarily political dictatorship.{{nbsp}}... The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy.{{nbsp}}... The Fascist militia was placed under military control.{{nbsp}}... The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders{{nbsp}}... nor was a major new police elite created.{{nbsp}}... There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.{{nbsp}}... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed.{{nbsp}}... The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stanley G.|last=Payne|title=A History of Fascism, 1914–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&amp;pg=PA122|year=1996|publisher=U of Wisconsin Press|page=122|isbn=978-0-299-14873-7|access-date=3 December 2016|archive-date=21 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221014633/https://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&amp;pg=PA122|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mussolini in power ====
Upon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament.&lt;ref name="sgp110" /&gt; Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies under the direction of liberal finance minister [[Alberto De Stefani]], a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt;

The Fascists began their attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the [[Acerbo Law]], which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote.&lt;ref name="sgp113" /&gt; Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy [[Giacomo Matteotti]] was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the [[Aventine Secession (20th century)|Aventine Secession]].&lt;ref name="sgp114" /&gt; On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.&lt;ref name=sgp114/&gt; From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.&lt;ref name="routledge42" /&gt;

==== Catholic Church ====
In 1929, the Fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century, but within two years the Church had renounced Fascism in the Encyclical ''[[Non Abbiamo Bisogno]]'' as a "pagan idolotry of the state" which teaches "hatred, violence and irreverence".&lt;ref name="routledge43" /&gt; Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession, the Church had threatened to have him "excommunicated", in part because of his intractable nature, but also because he had "confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', New York: Vintage Books, 1983, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the “papacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,’ because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself".&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', pp. 222–23&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was "basically irreligious until the later years of his life".&lt;ref&gt;Rachele Mussolini, ''Mussolini: An Intimate Biography'', New York: Pocket Books, 1977, p. 131. Originally published by William Morrow in 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis in Germany employed similar anti-clerical policies. The Gestapo confiscated hundreds of monasteries in Austria and Germany, evicted clergymen and laymen alike and often replaced crosses with swastikas.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen von Lang, ''The Secretary: Martin Bormann, The Man Who Manipulated Hitler'', New York: Random House, 1979, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the swastika as the "Devil’s Cross", church leaders found their youth organizations banned, their meetings limited and various Catholic periodicals censored or banned. Government officials eventually found it necessary to place "Nazis into editorial positions in the Catholic press".&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', New York: Penguin, 2005, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2,720 clerics, mostly Catholics, were arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned inside of Germany's Dachau concentration camp, resulting in over 1,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Berben, ''Dachau, 1933–1945: The Official History'', Norfolk Press 1975, pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corporatist economic system ====
The Fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of [[Pact of the Vidoni Palace|the Palazzo Vidoni Pact]], in which the Italian employers' association [[Confindustria]] and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions.&lt;ref name="cb150" /&gt; The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the [[Labour Charter of 1927|Charter of Labour]], which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt; In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt;

==== Aggressive foreign policy ====
In the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included an attack on the Greek island of [[Corfu]], ambitions to expand Italian territory in the [[Balkans]], plans to wage war against [[Turkey]] and [[Yugoslavia]], attempts to bring Yugoslavia into civil war by supporting Croat and Macedonian separatists to legitimize Italian intervention and making [[Albania]] a ''[[de facto]]'' [[protectorate]] of Italy, which was achieved through diplomatic means by 1927.&lt;ref name="expansionism" /&gt; In response to revolt in the Italian colony of [[Libya]], Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the "inferior" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.&lt;ref name="aaa134" /&gt; This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the [[Pacification of Libya]] against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s and the forced starvation of thousands of people.&lt;ref name=aaa134/&gt; Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.&lt;ref name="mussolini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university44" /&gt;

==== Hitler adopts Italian model ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, München, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Nazis in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] ]]
The March on Rome brought Fascism international attention. One early admirer of the Italian Fascists was [[Adolf Hitler]], who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the [[Nazi Party]] upon Mussolini and the Fascists.&lt;ref name="kershaw" /&gt; The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero [[Erich Ludendorff]], attempted a "March on Berlin" modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]] in November 1923.&lt;ref name="dissolution" /&gt;

[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right)]]
The conditions of economic hardship caused by the [[Great Depression]] brought about an international surge of social unrest. According to historian Philip Morgan, "the onset of the Great Depression … was the greatest stimulus yet to the diffusion and expansion of fascism outside Italy".&lt;ref name="Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acGhRyqfuGIC&amp;q=third+position&amp;pg=PT203|first=Philip|last=Morgan|title=Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2003|isbn=9781134740284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and [[scapegoat]]s: "[[anti-semitism|Judeo]]-[[Freemasonry|Masonic]]-[[Bolshevism|bolshevik]]" conspiracies, [[Left-wing politics#Nationalism, anti-imperialism and anti-nationalism|left-wing internationalism]] and the presence of [[immigrant]]s.

In Germany, it contributed to the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]], which resulted in the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the establishment of the fascist regime, [[Nazi Germany]], under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.

Fascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula Gömbös]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and attempted to entrench his [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country. He created an eight-hour work day and a forty-eight-hour work week in industry; sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary's neighbors.&lt;ref name="routledge45" /&gt; The fascist [[Iron Guard]] movement in [[Romania]] soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government, and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister [[Ion Duca]].&lt;ref name="routledge46" /&gt; During the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], [[France]] faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the [[Dreyfus Affair]] when the fascist [[Mouvement Franciste|Francist Movement]] and multiple far-right movements rioted ''[[en masse]]'' in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence.&lt;ref name="fascism" /&gt; A variety of '''para-fascist'''&lt;!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --&gt; governments that borrowed elements from fascism were formed during the Great Depression, including those of [[Greece]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="routledge47" /&gt;

[[File:SaudacaoIntegralista1935.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brazilian Integralism|Integralists]] marching in Brazil]]
In the Americas, the [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralists]] led by [[Plínio Salgado]] claimed as many as 200,000 members although following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] of [[Getúlio Vargas]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="griffin" /&gt; In the 1930s, the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] gained seats in [[Chile]]'s parliament and attempted a coup d'état that resulted in the [[Seguro Obrero massacre]] of 1938.&lt;ref name="routledge48" /&gt;

During the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy. He denounced the contemporary "[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]" that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure because of its alleged [[decadence]], its support for unlimited [[consumerism]] and its intention to create the "standardization of humankind".&lt;ref name="gb2000" /&gt; Fascist Italy created the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]] (IRI), a giant state-owned firm and holding company that provided state funding to failing private enterprises.&lt;ref name="cb189" /&gt; The IRI was made a permanent institution in Fascist Italy in 1937, pursued Fascist policies to create national [[autarky]] and had the power to take over private firms to maximize war production.&lt;ref name=cb189/&gt; While Hitler's regime only nationalized 500 companies in key industries by the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Overy, ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'', Clarendon Press (Oxford University Press), 1994, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini declared in 1934 that "[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini’s speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on 26 May 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the worldwide depression, Mussolini's government was able to take over most of Italy's largest failing banks, who held controlling interest in many Italian businesses. The Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state-operated holding company in charge of bankrupt banks and companies, reported in early 1934 that they held assets of "48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy", which later included the capital of the banks themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Toniolo, editor, ''The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Political historian Martin Blinkhorn estimated Italy's scope of state intervention and ownership "greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin’s Russia".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn (1991). ''Mussolini and Fascist Italy'', New York: Routledge, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, Italy enacted manufacturing cartels, tariff barriers, currency restrictions and massive regulation of the economy to attempt to balance payments.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 72"/&gt; Italy's policy of autarky failed to achieve effective economic autonomy.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 72"/&gt; Nazi Germany similarly pursued an economic agenda with the aims of autarky and rearmament and imposed [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies, including forcing the German steel industry to use lower-quality German iron ore rather than superior-quality imported iron.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia49"/&gt;

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===
In Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II. Mussolini called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and securing Italian access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the creation of Italian ''[[spazio vitale]]'' ("vital space") in the Mediterranean and [[Red Sea]] regions.&lt;ref name="expansionism50" /&gt; Hitler called for irredentist German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the Soviet Union, that would be colonized by Germans.&lt;ref name="expansionism51" /&gt;

[[File:Inmate at the Rab concentration camp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emaciation|Emaciated]] male inmate at the Italian [[Rab concentration camp]] ]]
From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded Ethiopia in 1935]] resulting in its condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Czechoslovakia was dissolved by the proclamation of the German client state of [[Slovak State|Slovakia]], followed by the next day of the occupation of the remaining [[Czech Lands]] and the proclamation of the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.&lt;ref name="university52" /&gt; In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.&lt;ref name="Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372" /&gt; The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.&lt;ref name="Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372"/&gt;

The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.&lt;ref name="university53" /&gt; Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in [[Egypt]] where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.&lt;ref name="university54" /&gt; Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged—contrary to Mussolini's plans—resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.

During World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the genocide known as the Holocaust.

After 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini [[25 Luglio|was removed as head of government and arrested]] on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.

On 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was [[denazification|systematically dismantled]] by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in [[Nuremberg#Nazi era|Nuremberg]]. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were [[Nuremberg trials|tried and convicted]] of [[war crime]]s, with many of the worst offenders being sentenced to death and executed.

=== Post-World War II (1945–present) ===
{{Main|Neo-fascism}}
[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juan Perón]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired [[Italian Fascism]] and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy.]]
The victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in [[World War II]] led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.

[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco had [[Blue Division|sent volunteers]] to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]], Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the Cold War, until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.

Historian Robert Paxton observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: "In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization". He goes on to observe that Salazar "crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization".&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Paxton, "The five stages of fascism." ''Journal of Modern History'' 70.1 (1998): 1–23, quotes at pp. 3, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton says that:
{{quote|Where Franco subjected Spain’s fascist party to his personal control, Salazar abolished outright in July 1934 the nearest thing Portugal had to an authentic fascist movement, Rolão Preto’s blue-shirted National Syndicalists{{nbsp}}... Salazar preferred to control his population through such “organic” institutions traditionally powerful in Portugal as the Church. Salazar's regime was not only non-fascist, but “voluntarily non-totalitarian,” preferring to let those of its citizens who kept out of politics “live by habit".{{sfn|Paxton|2004|p=150}}}}
Historians tend to view the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] as [[para-fascism|para-fascist]] in nature,&lt;ref name="Routledge Companion2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Davies|author2=Derek Lynch|title=The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right|url=https://archive.org/details/routledgecompani00davi|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/routledgecompani00davi/page/237 237]}}&lt;/ref&gt; possessing minimal fascist tendencies.
&lt;ref name="AVSI"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin Passmore|title=Fascism: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, including [[Fernando Rosas]] and Manuel Villaverde Cabral, think that the Estado Novo should be considered fascist.&lt;ref name="Rosas"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fernando Rosas|title=Salazar e os Fascismos: Ensaio Breve de História Comparada|year=2019|publisher=Edições Tinta-da-China|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, [[Peronism]], associated with the regime of [[Juan Perón]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was influenced by fascism.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512" /&gt; Between 1939 and 1941, prior to his rise to power, Perón had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist policies.&lt;ref name="Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512"/&gt;

The term neo-fascism refers to fascist movements after World War II. In Italy, the [[Italian Social Movement]] led by [[Giorgio Almirante]] was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described "post-fascist" movement called the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), which has been an ally of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party [[The People of Freedom]], but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name [[Brothers of Italy]]. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.

[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|right|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece in 2012]]
After the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece's parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24314319 |title=Greece's Golden Dawn leader Michaloliakos held in crackdown |work=BBC |date=28 September 2013 |access-date=28 September 2013 |archive-date=28 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24314319 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eek.gr/index.php/englishtext/79-articles/englishtext/1972-the-arrest-of-the-nazi-gangsters-of-golden-dawn-in-Greece|title=The Arrest of the Nazi Gangsters of Golden Dawn in Greece|publisher=EEK|date=September 2013|access-date=9 June 2020|archive-date=13 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613061925/http://www.eek.gr/index.php/englishtext/79-articles/englishtext/1972-the-arrest-of-the-nazi-gangsters-of-golden-dawn-in-Greece|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2020, Athens Appeals Court announced verdicts for 68 defendants, including the party's political leadership.

== Tenets ==
[[Robert O. Paxton]] finds that even though fascism "maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy," it cannot be considered "simply a more muscular form of conservatism," because "fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called 'revolutionary'".&lt;ref name="Robert O 2004 p. 11"&gt;[[Robert O. Paxton|Paxton, Robert O.]] (2004) ''The Anatomy Of Fascism''. New York: Knopf. p. 11. {{isbn|978-1-4000-4094-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations "often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property." Paxton argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;[F]ascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive—party and state—in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.&lt;ref name="Robert O 2004 p. 11"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nationalism with or without expansionism===
{{Nationalism sidebar|Types}}
Ultranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. pp. 451-453"&gt;Roger Griffin, "Nationalism" in Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia'', vol. 2 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006), pp. 451–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Paxton argues that "a passionate nationalism" is the basis of fascism, combined with "a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history" which holds that "the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert O. Paxton|Paxton, Robert O.]] (2004) ''The Anatomy Of Fascism''. New York: Knopf. p. 41. {{isbn|978-1-4000-4094-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Griffin identifies the core of fascism as being [[palingenetic]] ultranationalism.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1993 27"/&gt;

The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity that binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people.&lt;ref name="nationalism56" /&gt; Fascism seeks to solve economic, political and social problems by achieving a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] national rebirth, exalting the nation or [[race (biology)|race]] above all else and promoting cults of unity, strength and purity.&lt;ref name="anatomnyfascismo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natureoffascismo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walterlaq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britannicafasc" /&gt; European fascist movements typically espouse a racist conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, p. 11"&gt;Payne, Stanley G., ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. (Routledge, 1995, 2005), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, fascists in Europe have not held a unified set of racial views.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, p. 11"/&gt; Historically, most fascists promoted imperialism, although there have been several fascist movements that were uninterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995, p. 11"/&gt; For example, Nazism and Italian Fascism were [[expansionist]] and [[irredentist]]. Falangism in Spain envisioned the worldwide unification of Spanish-speaking peoples ([[Hispanidad]]). [[British Fascism]] was [[non-interventionist]], though it did embrace the British Empire.

=== Totalitarianism ===
Fascism promotes the establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''Fascism, Totalitarianism, and Political Religion''. Routledge. pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems and may support a [[one-party state]] so that it may synthesize with the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/OriginsAndDoctrineOfFascismGiovanniGentile/page/n49/mode/2up Origins and Doctrine of Fascism] Giovanni (1934), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's ''The Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932) &amp;ndash; partly [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]],&lt;ref&gt;"The first half of the article was the work of Giovanni Gentile; only the second half was Mussolini's own work, though the whole article appeared under his name." Lyttelton, Adrian (1973) ''Italian Fascisms: from Pareto to Gentile''. London:Cape. p.13&lt;/ref&gt; who Mussolini described as "the philosopher of Fascism" &amp;ndash; states:
{{quote|The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people".&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt;}}
In ''The Legal Basis of the Total State'', Nazi political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]] described the Nazi intention to form a "strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity" in order to avoid a "disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart".&lt;ref name="schmitt" /&gt;

Fascist states pursued policies of social [[indoctrination]] through [[propaganda]] in education and the media, and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.&lt;ref name="totalitarianism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google68" /&gt; Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.&lt;ref name="pauley" /&gt;

=== Economy ===
{{Main|Economics of fascism}}
Fascism presented itself as an alternative to both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bastow, James Martin. ''Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century''. Edinburgh University Press Ltd, 2003. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; While fascism opposed mainstream socialism, it sometimes regarded itself as a type of nationalist "socialism" to highlight their commitment to national [[solidarity]] and unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/duce.html |title=Benito Mussolini, Doctrine of Fascism (1932). |access-date=28 July 2016 |archive-date=31 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731235010/http://www.historyguide.org/europe/duce.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blamires1"&gt;Blamires, Cyprian, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006) p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists opposed international free market capitalism, but supported a type of productive capitalism.&lt;ref name=CritTheory&gt;{{cite book |last=Held |first=David |year=1980 |title=Introduction to Critical Theory: Horkheimer to Habermas |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-04175-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"&gt;Alberto Spektorowski, Liza Ireni-Saban. ''Politics of Eugenics: Productionism, Population, and National Welfare''. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic self-sufficiency, known as autarky, was a major goal of most fascist governments.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. De Grand, ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', Routledge, 1995. pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist governments advocated resolution of domestic [[class conflict]] within a nation in order to secure national solidarity.&lt;ref name="Griffin, Roger 1991 pp. 222-223"/&gt; This would be done through the state mediating relations between the classes (contrary to the views of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]]-inspired capitalists).&lt;ref&gt;Calvin B. Hoover, ''The Paths of Economic Change: Contrasting Tendencies in the Modern World'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 25, No. 1, Supplement, Papers and Proceedings of the Forty-seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association. (March 1935), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; While fascism was opposed to domestic class conflict, it was held that bourgeois-proletarian conflict existed primarily in national conflict between [[proletarian nation]]s versus [[bourgeois nation]]s.&lt;ref name="minneapolis" /&gt; Fascism condemned what it viewed as widespread character traits that it associated as the typical bourgeois mentality that it opposed, such as: materialism, crassness, cowardice and the inability to comprehend the heroic ideal of the fascist "warrior"; and associations with liberalism, individualism and parliamentarianism.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 102"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Mussolini defined what he viewed as the proletarian character, defining proletarian as being one and the same with producers, a [[Productivism|productivist]] perspective that associated all people deemed productive, including entrepreneurs, technicians, workers and soldiers as being proletarian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marco Piraino, Stefano Fiorito. Fascist Identity. pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the historical existence of both bourgeois and proletarian producers but declared the need for bourgeois producers to merge with proletarian producers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While fascism denounced the mainstream internationalist and Marxist socialisms, it claimed to economically represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism that while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; This was derived from [[Henri de Saint Simon]], whose ideas inspired the creation of [[utopian socialism]] and influenced other ideologies, that stressed solidarity rather than class war and whose conception of productive people in the economy included both productive workers and productive bosses to challenge the influence of the aristocracy and unproductive financial speculators.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 535"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Simon's vision combined the traditionalist right-wing criticisms of the French Revolution with a left-wing belief in the need for association or collaboration of productive people in society.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 535"/&gt; Whereas Marxism condemned capitalism as a system of exploitative property relations, fascism saw the nature of the control of credit and money in the contemporary capitalist system as abusive.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Unlike Marxism, fascism did not see class conflict between the Marxist-defined proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a given or as an engine of historical materialism.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Instead, it viewed workers and productive capitalists in common as productive people who were in conflict with parasitic elements in society including: corrupt political parties, corrupt financial capital and feeble people.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler spoke of the need to create a new managerial elite led by engineers and captains of industry—but free from the parasitic leadership of industries.&lt;ref name="Alberto Spektorowski 2013"/&gt; Hitler stated that the Nazi Party supported ''bodenständigen Kapitalismus'' ("productive capitalism") that was based upon profit earned from one's own labour, but condemned unproductive capitalism or loan capitalism, which derived profit from speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan C. Friedman. ''The Routledge History of the Holocaust.'' Routledge, 2011. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist economics supported a state-controlled economy that accepted a mix of [[private ownership|private]] and [[public ownership]] over the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name="Robert Millward 1990. p. 178"&gt;Robert Millward. Private and public enterprise in Europe: energy, telecommunications and transport, 1830–1990. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic planning]] was applied to both the public and private sector and the prosperity of private enterprise depended on its acceptance of synchronizing itself with the economic goals of the state.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 189"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist economic ideology supported the [[profit motive]], but emphasized that industries must uphold the national interest as superior to private profit.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 189"/&gt;

While fascism accepted the importance of material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and [[capitalism]] and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement of the role of the [[Spirit (animating force)|spirit]].&lt;ref name="Peter Davies 2002. p. 103"&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right. Routledge, 2002. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascists criticized capitalism, not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation.&lt;ref name="Robert O. Paxton 2005. p. 10"&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. Vintage Books edition. Vintage Books, 2005. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;John Breuilly. ''Nationalism and the State.'' University of Chicago Press edition. University of Chicago, 1994. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the spread of fascism beyond Italy, historian Philip Morgan states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the Depression was a crisis of laissez-faire capitalism and its political counterpart, parliamentary democracy, fascism could pose as the 'third-way' alternative between capitalism and Bolshevism, the model of a new European 'civilization'. As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, "from 1929{{nbsp}}... fascism has become a universal phenomenon{{nbsp}}... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, [and] liberalism have been exhausted{{nbsp}}... the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist' (Mussolini 1935: 32).&lt;ref name="Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fascists criticized egalitarianism as preserving the weak, and they instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies.&lt;ref name="egalitarianism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university101" /&gt; They were in principle opposed to the idea of [[social welfare]], arguing that it "encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–1939'', New York: The Penguin Press, 2005, pp. 483–84&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi Party condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic, as well as private charity and philanthropy, for supporting people whom they regarded as racially inferior and weak, and who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–1939'', New York: The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression, the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially-pure Germans in order to maintain popular support, while arguing that this represented "racial self-help" and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–1939'', New York: The Penguin Press, 2005, pp. 484–85&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Nazi programs such as the [[Winterhilfswerk|Winter Relief of the German People]] and the broader [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt|National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) were organized as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race—although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–1939'', New York: The Penguin Press, 2005, pp. 486–87&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were "racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce." Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the "work-shy", "asocials" and the "hereditarily ill."&lt;ref name="Richard J 2005, p. 489"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–1939'', New York: The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, by 1939, over 17 million Germans had obtained assistance from the NSV, and the agency "projected a powerful image of caring and support" for "those who were judged to have got into difficulties through no fault of their own."&lt;ref name="Richard J 2005, p. 489"/&gt; Yet the organization was "feared and disliked among society's poorest" because it resorted to intrusive questioning and monitoring to judge who was worthy of support.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–1939'', New York: The Penguin Press, 2005, pp. 489–90&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Action ===
Fascism emphasizes [[direct action]], including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1945. p. 106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Breuilly. ''Nationalism and the State.'' p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an "endless struggle".&lt;ref name="Political Theory 2010. p. 106"&gt;''Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology.'' Oxon, England; New York: Routledge, 2010. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private [[militias]] (e.g. the Nazi Party's [[Brown shirts]] and Fascist Italy's [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|Blackshirts]]).

The basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism.&lt;ref name="Political Theory 2010. p. 106"/&gt; Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies.&lt;ref name="psg485" /&gt; They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or [[Degeneration|degenerate]] people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.&lt;ref name="university64" /&gt;

Fascism emphasizes [[youth]] both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action.&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 2007. p. 171"&gt;Mark Antliff. ''Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909–1939''. Duke University Press, 2007. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called ''[[Giovinezza]]'' ("The Youth").&lt;ref name="Mark Antliff 2007. p. 171"/&gt; Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Laqueur argues that:
:The corollaries of the cult of war and physical danger were the cult of brutality, strength, and sexuality … [fascism is] a true counter-civilization: rejecting the sophisticated rationalist humanism of Old Europe, fascism sets up as its ideal the primitive instincts and primal emotions of the barbarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Laqueur|title=Fascism: A Reader's Guide : Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2s8OaLD7y_oC&amp;pg=PA341|year=1978|publisher=U of California Press|page=341|isbn=978-0-520-03642-0|access-date=7 July 2018|archive-date=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331114628/https://books.google.com/books?id=2s8OaLD7y_oC&amp;pg=PA341|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism pursued what it called "moral hygiene" of youth, particularly regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47"&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47"/&gt; It condemned [[pornography]], most forms of [[birth control]] and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the [[condom]]), [[homosexuality]] and [[prostitution]] as deviant sexual behaviour, although enforcement of laws opposed to such practices was erratic and authorities often turned a blind eye.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47" /&gt; Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before [[puberty]] as the cause of criminality amongst male youth, declared homosexuality a social disease and pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.&lt;ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. pp. 46-47"/&gt;

Mussolini perceived women's primary role as primarily child bearers and men, warriors—once saying: "War is to man what maternity is to the woman".&lt;ref name="psychoanalysis" /&gt; In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies intended to reduce the number of women employed.&lt;ref name="mussolini73" /&gt; Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as "reproducers of the nation" and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation.&lt;ref name="university74" /&gt; In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a "major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment" and that for women, working was "incompatible with childbearing". Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the "exodus of women from the work force".&lt;ref name="routledge75" /&gt;

The German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house.&lt;ref name="evans76" /&gt; This policy was reinforced by bestowing the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.&lt;ref name="msu" /&gt;

The Nazis decriminalized abortion in cases where fetuses had hereditary defects or were of a race the government disapproved of, while the abortion of healthy pure German, [[Aryan race|Aryan]] fetuses remained strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name="The origins of Nazi genocide: from euthanasia to the final solution" /&gt; For non-Aryans, abortion was often compulsory. Their [[eugenics]] program also stemmed from the "progressive biomedical model" of [[Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="publishing" /&gt; In 1935, Nazi Germany expanded the legality of [[history of abortion|abortion]] by amending [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|its eugenics law]], to promote abortion for women with hereditary disorders.&lt;ref name="The origins of Nazi genocide: from euthanasia to the final solution"/&gt; The law allowed abortion if a woman gave her permission and the fetus was not yet viable&lt;ref name="Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gender and Crime in Modern Europe" /&gt; and for purposes of so-called [[racial hygiene]].&lt;ref name="Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis71" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Women's studies encyclopedia" /&gt;

The Nazis said that homosexuality was degenerate, effeminate, perverted and undermined masculinity because it did not produce children.&lt;ref name="evans78" /&gt; They considered homosexuality curable through therapy, citing modern [[scientism]] and the study of [[sexology]], which said that homosexuality could be felt by "normal" people and not just an abnormal minority.&lt;ref name="fascism79" /&gt; Open homosexuals were interned in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich" /&gt;

=== Palingenesis and modernism ===
Fascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Blamires168"&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006 p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character.&lt;ref name="Cyprian Blamires 2006. pp. 451-453" /&gt; Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence.&lt;ref name="Blamires168" /&gt; Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2006 pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1997. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly [[Fordism]] and [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fascist Modernism" by Jobst Welge. Astradur Eysteinsson (ed.), Vivian Liska (ed.). ''Modernism, Volumes 1–2''. John Benjamins Publishing, 2007. p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, such modernist influence was exemplified by Marinetti who advocated a palingenetic modernist society that condemned liberal-bourgeois values of tradition and psychology, while promoting a technological-martial religion of national renewal that emphasized militant nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Fascist Modernism" by Jobst Welge. Astradur Eysteinsson (ed.), Vivian Liska (ed.). ''Modernism, Volumes 1–2''. John Benjamins Publishing, 2007. p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, it was exemplified by Jünger who was influenced by his observation of the technological warfare during World War I and claimed that a new social class had been created that he described as the "warrior-worker".&lt;ref name="jobstwelge"&gt;"Fascist Modernism" by Jobst Welge. Astradur Eysteinsson (ed.), Vivian Liska (ed.). ''Modernism, Volumes 1–2''. John Benjamins Publishing, 2007. p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; Jünger, like Marinetti, emphasized the revolutionary capacities of technology. He emphasized an "organic construction" between human and machine as a liberating and regenerative force that challenged liberal democracy, conceptions of individual autonomy, bourgeois nihilism and decadence.&lt;ref name="jobstwelge" /&gt; He conceived of a society based on a totalitarian concept of "total mobilization" of such disciplined warrior-workers.&lt;ref name="jobstwelge" /&gt;

=== Fascist aesthetics ===
According to cultural critic [[Susan Sontag]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fascist aesthetics … flow from (and justify) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. The relations of domination and enslavement take the form of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful, hypnotic leader-figure or force. The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets, uniformly garbed and shown in ever swelling numbers. Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, "virile" posing. Fascist art glorifies surrender, it exalts mindlessness, it glamorizes death.&lt;ref name=sontag&gt;[[Susan Sontag|Sontag, Susan]] (February 6, 1975) [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1975/02/06/fascinating-fascism/ "Fascinating Fascism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200718114505/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1975/02/06/fascinating-fascism/ |date=18 July 2020 }} ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sontag also enumerates some commonalities between fascist art and the official art of communist countries, such as the obeisance of the masses to the hero, and a preference for the monumental and the "grandiose and rigid" choreography of mass bodies. But whereas official communist art "aims to expound and reinforce a utopian morality", the art of fascist countries such as Nazi Germany "displays a utopian aesthetics &amp;ndash; that of physical perfection", in a way that is "both prurient and idealizing".&lt;ref name=sontag /&gt;

"Fascist aesthetics", according to Sontag, "is based on the containment of vital forces; movements are confined, held tight, held in." And its appeal is not necessarily limited to those who share the fascist political ideology, because "fascism ... stands for an ideal or rather ideals that are persistent today under the other banners: the ideal of life as art, the cult of beauty, the fetishism of courage, the dissolution of alienation in ecstatic feelings of community; the repudiation of the intellect; the family of man (under the parenthood of leaders)."&lt;ref name=sontag /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Fascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.

=== Anti-democratic and tyrannical ===
{{Further|Anti-democratic thought}}
[[File:Hitler and Franco at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hitler and Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Meeting at Hendaye]], on 23 October 1940]]
One of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a [[tyranny]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]]. ''Theories of Tyranny, from Plato to Arendt''. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barry Clarke, Joe Foweraker. ''Encyclopedia of Democratic Thought''. Routledge, 2001. p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. Routledge, 1998. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''The Nature of Fascism''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unprincipled opportunism ===
Some critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled [[opportunism]] by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public.&lt;ref name="Gerhard Schreiber 1995. p. 111"&gt;[[Gerhard Schreiber]], [[Bernd Stegemann]], [[Detlef Vogel]]. ''Germany and the Second World War: Volume III: The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939–1941 (From Italy's Declaration of Non-Belligerence to the Entry of the United States into the War)'' (Oxford University Press, 1995) p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Washburn Child]], the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: "Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes".&lt;ref name="Benito Mussolini 1998"&gt;Mussolini, Benito, ''My Rise And Fall, Volumes 1–2''. Da Capo Press ed. (Da Capo Press, 1998) p. ix. (Note: Mussolini wrote the second volume about his fall from power as head of government of the Kingdom of Italy in 1943, though he was restored to power in northern Italy by the German military.)&lt;/ref&gt; Child quoted Mussolini as saying: "The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine, first of all, must run!"&lt;ref name="Benito Mussolini 1998"/&gt;

Some have criticized Mussolini's actions during the outbreak of World War I as opportunistic for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist egalitarian internationalism for non-egalitarian [[nationalism]] and note, to that effect, that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from Italian and foreign sources, such as [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack,''Modern Italy: A Political History''. (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the British Security Service [[MI5]].&lt;ref name="Guardian2009-10-13"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy |work=Guardian |location=UK |title=Recruited by MI5: the name's Mussolini. Benito Mussolini&amp;nbsp;– Documents reveal Italian dictator got start in politics in 1917 with help of £100 weekly wage from MI5 |date=13 October 2009 |access-date=14 October 2009 |first=Tom |last=Kington |archive-date=19 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519191439/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, including Mussolini's socialist opponents at the time, have noted that regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' without prior sanctioning from his financial backers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Paul, ''Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the major source of financial support that Mussolini and the fascist movement received in World War I was from France and is widely believed to have been French socialists who supported the French government's war against Germany and who sent support to Italian socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side.&lt;ref name="Gregor-1979-p-200"&gt;Gregor 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini's transformation away from Marxism into what eventually became fascism began prior to World War I, as Mussolini had grown increasingly pessimistic about Marxism and egalitarianism while becoming increasingly supportive of figures who opposed egalitarianism, such as Friedrich Nietzsche.&lt;ref name="Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249"&gt;Golomb &amp; Wistrich 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;249.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902, Mussolini was studying Georges Sorel, Nietzsche and [[Vilfredo Pareto]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Delzel, Charles F., ed. ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' (Harper Rowe, 1970) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent liberal democracy and capitalism by the use of violence, direct action, general strikes and [[Machiavelli|neo-Machiavellian]] appeals to emotion impressed Mussolini deeply.&lt;ref name="Mediterranean3"&gt;Delzel, Charles F., ed. ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945'' (Harper Rowe, 1970) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche's promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views.&lt;ref name="Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249"/&gt; Prior to World War I, Mussolini's writings over time indicated that he had abandoned the Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported in favour of Nietzsche's ''übermensch'' concept and anti-egalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Golomb-Wistrich-2002-p-249"/&gt; In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called "Philosophy of Strength" based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe in challenging both religion and [[nihilism]]: "[A] new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing".&lt;ref name="Gigliola Gori 2004. p. 14"/&gt;

=== Ideological dishonesty ===
Fascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"&gt;[[John F. Pollard]]. ''The Fascist Experience in Italy''. Routledge, 1998. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during [[Dino Grandi]]'s tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in ''[[realpolitik]]'' free of such fascist hyperbole.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. James Burgwyn]]. ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918–1940''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini's first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce [[Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]].

After antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterraneanism]].&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129" /&gt; Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the [[Lombards]] took control of Italy after the [[fall of Ancient Rome]], they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] language within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of [[Italian nationalists]] scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of [[ancient Roman civilization]] as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]] to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as "newcomers" to civilization in comparison.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17"/&gt; At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman Arthur de Gobineau.&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; After the tension in [[German-Italian relations]] diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt;

In 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic,&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt; In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse [[antisemitism]] until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period, there had been notable [[Jewish Italians]] who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress.&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt; Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as [[Italo Balbo]], who came from [[Ferrara]] which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them.&lt;ref name="John Pollard 1998. p. 129"/&gt; Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian Bolsheviks and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. Open University Press, 1997. pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;
