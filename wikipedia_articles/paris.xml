==Toponymy==
{{main|Etymology of London}}
''London'' is an ancient name, already attested in the first century AD, usually in the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form {{lang|la|[[Londinium]]}};&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mills|first=Anthony David|title=A Dictionary of London Place Names|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2001|isbn=9780192801067|pages=139|oclc=45406491}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70–80 include the word {{lang|la|Londinio}} ('in London').&lt;ref name=NameTablets&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36415563 |title=UK's oldest hand-written document 'at Roman London dig' |work=BBC News |date=1 June 2016 |access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s {{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}, written around 1136.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Matt|date=15 January 2014|title=How London Got Its Name|url=https://londonist.com/2014/01/how-london-got-its-name|access-date=29 March 2021|website=[[Londonist]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: [[Latin]] (usually {{lang|la|Londinium}}), [[Old English]] (usually {{lang|ang|Lunden}}), and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (usually {{lang|cy|Llundein}}), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from [[Common Brittonic|Common Brythonic]]; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as {{lang|cel-x-proto|*Londonjon}} or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as {{lang|la|Londinium}} and borrowed into [[Old English]], the ancestor-language of English.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bynon |first1=Theodora |year=2016 |title=London's Name |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=114 |issue= 3|pages=281–97 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.12064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toponymy of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent explanation was [[Richard Coates]]'s 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] *{{PIE|''(p)lowonida''}}, meaning "river too wide to ford". Coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, {{lang|cel-x-proto|*Lowonidonjon}}.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coates |first=Richard |year=1998 |title=A new explanation of the name of London |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=203–229 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a Celtic derivative of a [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *{{PIE|''lend&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;-''}} ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the Celtic suffix {{lang|cel-x-proto|*-injo-}} or {{lang|cel-x-proto|*-onjo-}} (used to form place-names). [[Peter Schrijver]] has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schrijver|first=Peter|title=Language Contact and the Origins of the Germanic Languages|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|isbn=9781138245372|location=New York|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Until 1889, the name "London" applied officially only to the [[City of London]], but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to [[Greater London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mills|first=David|title=A Dictionary of London Place Names|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2001|isbn=9780192801067|pages=140|oclc=45406491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing, "London" is, on occasion, [[colloquial]]ly [[contraction (grammar)|contracted]] to "LDN".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LDN Flood Week 2017 |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-prepared/ldn-flood-week-2017 |access-date=11 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912022230/https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-prepared/ldn-flood-week-2017 |archive-date=12 September 2018 |url-status=live |date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2020}} Such usage originated in [[SMS language]], and is often found, on a [[social media]] [[user profile]], [[suffix]]ing an [[pseudonym|alias]] or handle.

===Anglo-Saxon and Viking period London===
With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of [[Londinium]] was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the area of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] until around 450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The last days of Londinium|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108092449/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm|archive-date=8 January 2009|access-date=31 March 2013|website=[[Museum of London]]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 500, an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement known as [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] developed slightly west of the old Roman city.&lt;ref name=london_011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |title=The early years of Lundenwic |publisher=The [[Museum of London]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610043903/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |archive-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated [[Viking]] assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.&lt;ref name="Viking Attacks"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/viking_attacklist.html?showall=1 |title=Viking Attacks |access-date=19 January 2016 |last1=Wheeler |first1=Kip |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101055729/https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/viking_attacklist.html?showall=1 |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vikings]] established [[Danelaw]] over much of eastern and northern England; its boundary stretched roughly from London to [[Chester]]. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the [[Danes|Danish]] [[warlord]], [[Guthrum]] and the [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] king [[Alfred the Great]] in 886. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.&lt;ref name="blackwell"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Vince |first=Alan |year=2001 |title=London |editor=Lapidge, Michael |editor2=Blair, John |editor3=Keynes, Simon |editor4=Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. [[Westminster Abbey]], rebuilt in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by King [[Edward the Confessor]], was one of the grandest churches in Europe. [[Winchester]] had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of [[Frank Stenton]]: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Frank Stenton |last=Stenton |first=Frank |year=1971 |title=Anglo-Saxon England |pages=538–539 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-19-280139-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Blair |first=John |year=2001 |title=Westminster |editor=Lapidge, Michael |editor2=Blair, John |editor3=Keynes, Simon |editor4=Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the [[Westminster|City of Westminster]] developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.&lt;ref name=london_019&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Schofield |first1=John |last2=Vince |first2=Alan|author2-link=Alan Vince |title=Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8264-6002-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu7QLC7g7VgC&amp;pg=PA26 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaster struck in the form of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ibeji|first=Dr. Mike|date=10 March 2011|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: Black Death|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_01.shtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430191039/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_01.shtml|archive-date=30 April 2011|access-date=3 November 2008|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; London was the focus of the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref name=london_020&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/richard_ii_king.shtml |title=Richard II (1367–1400) |publisher=BBC |access-date=12 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430191132/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/richard_ii_king.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

London was also a centre of England's [[History of the Jews in England (1066–1290)|Jewish population]] before their [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290.

During the [[Tudor period]] the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.&lt;ref name="pevsner"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Nikolaus|title=London - The Cities of London and Westminster|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|edition=2nd|volume=1|publication-date=1 January 1962|pages=48|asin=B0000CLHU5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1475, the [[Hanseatic League]] set up its main trading base (''[[kontor]]'') of England in London, called the ''Stalhof'' or ''[[Steelyard]]''. It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of [[Lübeck]], [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]] sold the property to [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Steelyard, Merchants of the}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woollen]] cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the [[Low Countries]], where it was considered indispensable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pounds|first=Normal J.

But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the [[Mediterranean]] Sea normally lay through [[Antwerp]] and over the [[Alps]]; any ships passing through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to or from England were likely to be Italian or [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]]. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ramsay|first=George Daniel|title=The Queen's Merchants and the Revolt of the Netherlands (The End of the Antwerp Mart, Vol 2)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=1986|isbn=9780719018497|pages=1 &amp; 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burgon|first=John William|title=The Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham, Founder of the Royal Exchange: Including Notices of Many of His Contemporaries.

London became the principal [[North Sea]] port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

In the 16th century [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]]. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on [[James I of England|James I]] in Westminster, in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605.&lt;ref name=london_023&gt;{{Cite book |title=James I |last=Durston |first=Christopher |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-07779-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jamesi0000durs/page/59 59] |url=https://archive.org/details/jamesi0000durs/page/59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1637, the government of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to reform administration in the area of London. The plan called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the [[Liberties of London]], a lack of interest in administering these additional areas, or concern by city guilds of having to share power, the Corporation refused. Later called "The Great Refusal", this decision largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the [[City of London|City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doolittle | first1 = Ian | year = 2014 | title = 'The Great Refusal': Why Does the City of London Corporation Only Govern the Square Mile? | journal = The London Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 21–36 | doi = 10.1179/0305803413Z.00000000038 | s2cid = 159791907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[English Civil War]] the majority of Londoners supported the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] cause. After an initial advance by the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] in 1642, culminating in the battles of [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]] and [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the [[Lines of Communication (London)|Lines of Communication]]. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Flintham|first=David|title=London|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/london/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116190923/http://www.fortified-places.com/london/|archive-date=16 January 2009|access-date=28 March 2021|website=Fortified Places}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[coffeehouse]] became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing [[literacy]] and the development of the [[printing press]] making news widely available; and [[Fleet Street]] became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the [[Royal Navy]] became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power.

{{main|Local government in London|History of local government in London|List of heads of London government}}
The administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.&lt;ref name="london_032"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who runs London - Find Out Who Runs London and How|url=http://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/who-runs-london|access-date=28 March 2021|website=[[London Councils]]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLA consists of two elected components: the [[mayor of London]], who has [[executive powers]], and the [[London Assembly]], which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year.
The headquarters of the GLA is [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], [[Southwark]]. The mayor since 2016 has been [[Sadiq Khan]], the first [[Muslim]] mayor of a major Western capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=James |first1=William |last2=Piper |first2=Elizabeth |title=Labour's Khan becomes first Muslim mayor of London after bitter campaign |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-election-london-idUKKCN0XX1W4 |access-date=19 September 2016 |work=Reuters |date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London Elections 2016: Results|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2016/london/results|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor's [[statutory planning]] strategy is published as the [[London Plan]], which was most recently revised in 2011.&lt;ref name="london_plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=The London Plan|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508220051/http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan|archive-date=8 May 2012|access-date=25 May 2012|website=[[Greater London Authority]]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local authorities are the councils of the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London Corporation]].&lt;ref name="london_035"&gt;{{cite web|title=London Government Directory - London Borough Councils|url=http://directory.londoncouncils.gov.uk/|access-date=29 March 2017|website=[[London Councils]]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, [[social work|social services]], local roads and refuse collection.

Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Crerar|first1=Pippa|last2=Gayle|first2=Damien|date=10 April 2018|title=Sadiq Khan Holds City Hall Summit on How To Tackle Violent Crime|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/10/sadiq-khan-holds-city-hall-summit-on-how-to-tackle-violent|access-date=25 March 2021|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater London encompasses a total area of {{convert|1583|km2|sqmi}}, an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of {{convert|4542|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}.

The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. Historically London grew up at the [[lowest bridging point]] on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marsh]]lands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.&lt;ref name=london_065&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&amp;pg=PR11 |title=London: A History |first=Francis |last=Sheppard |page=10 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-285369-1 |access-date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Victorian era]] the Thames has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[Tributaries of the River Thames|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]]. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.&lt;ref name=london_066&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |title=Flooding |publisher=UK [[Environment Agency]] |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215080725/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |archive-date=15 February 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in [[Tide|high water]] level by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles (up in Scotland and Northern Ireland and down in southern parts of [[England]], [[Wales]] and Ireland) caused by [[post-glacial rebound]].&lt;ref name=london_067&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |title="Sea Levels"&amp;nbsp;– UK Environment Agency |publisher=[[Environment Agency]] |access-date=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523225152/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |archive-date=23 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=8805 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822014958/https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=8805 |title=New coastland map could help strengthen sea defences |date=7 October 2009 |publisher=[[Durham University]] |archive-date=22 August 2018 |access-date=21 August 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Adam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/31/thames-flood-barrier-london |title=Thames Barrier gets extra time as London's main flood defence |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=31 March 2009 |access-date=7 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140001/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/31/thames-flood-barrier-london |archive-date=1 May 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

London has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb ''). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at [[Kew]]. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is {{Convert|189|mm|in|order=flip|abbr=}} in November 1755 and the least is {{Convert|0|mm|in|order=flip|abbr=}} in both December 1788 and July 1800.

===Districts===
{{main|List of districts of London|London boroughs}}

Places within London's vast urban area are identified using district names, such as [[Mayfair]], [[Southwark]], [[Wembley]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|former boroughs]].

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.

[[File:Trafalgar Square by Christian Reimer.jpg|thumb|Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right|alt=|left]]
London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, these being a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the [[Tudor period|Tudor-period]] [[Hampton Court Palace]], England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] {{circa}}1515.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |magazine=BBC History |date=29 March 2011 |author=Foyle, Jonathan |access-date=16 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430191119/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by [[Christopher Wren|Wren]], neoclassical financial institutions such as the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]].

The disused—but soon{{when|date=March 2021}} to be rejuvenated—1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].&lt;ref name=london_078&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |title=Paddington Station |publisher=Great Buildings |access-date=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525164017/http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]] and [[Canary Wharf]], high residential densities in [[inner London]], and lower densities in [[Outer London]].
[[File:30 St Mary Axe from Leadenhall Street.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Modern styles juxtaposed with historic styles; [[30 St Mary Axe]], also known as "The Gherkin", towers over [[St Andrew Undershaft]].|alt=|right]]
[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]], respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]].&lt;ref name=london_077&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1&amp;xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml |title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ? |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=12 October 2008 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Lonsdale |date=27 March 2008 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130308205754/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/greenproperty/3360810/Eco-homes-Wooden-it-be-lovely...-.html |archive-date=8 March 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:Buckingham Palace from gardens, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|left|thumb|[[Buckingham Palace]] is the official residence of the British monarch]] --&gt;
In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as [[30 St Mary Axe]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]], are mostly in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London (see [[Tall buildings in London]]), including the 95-storey [[Shard London Bridge]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United Kingdom|tallest building in the United Kingdom]].

Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape,&lt;ref name=london_079&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm |title=Inside London's new 'glass egg' |date=16 July 2002 |work=BBC News |access-date=26 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528025840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm |archive-date=28 May 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Art Deco]] [[BBC Broadcasting House]] plus the [[Postmodernism|Postmodernist]] [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] and [[No 1 Poultry]] by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

===Natural history===
The [[London Natural History Society]] suggests that London is "one of the World's Greenest Cities" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the [[Tideway|tidal Thames]] supports 120 species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lnhs.org.uk/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212143739/http://www.lnhs.org.uk/Index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2007 |title=Wildlife in London, England: LNHS Home page |website=lnhs.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in [[central London]] and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's [[wetland]] areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs), two [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s and 76 [[List of local nature reserves in Greater London|local nature reserve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=London Natural History Society - Home|url=https://lnhs.org.uk/|access-date=25 March 2021|website=lnhs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amphibians]] are common in the capital, including [[smooth newt]]s living by the [[Tate Modern]], and [[common frog]]s, [[common toad]]s, [[palmate newt]]s and [[great crested newt]]s. On the other hand, native reptiles such as [[slowworm]]s, [[common lizard]]s, [[barred grass snake]]s and [[Vipera berus|adders]], are mostly only seen in [[Outer London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tuffrey|first=Laurie|date=27 July 2012|title=London's Amphibians and Reptile Populations Mapped|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/27/london-amphibian-reptile-map|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102204944/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/27/london-amphibian-reptile-map|archive-date=2 January 2021|access-date=25 March 2021|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Duncan~ - Fox Trot.jpg|thumb|left|A fox on Ayres Street, [[Southwark]], [[South London]] ]]

Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 [[red fox]]es, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the [[Houses of Parliament]], where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]], reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II's prized [[pink flamingo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=3 February 1996|title=Fox Kills Queen's Pet Flamingos|url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/feb/03/fox-kills-queens-pet-flamingos/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210325210722/https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/feb/03/fox-kills-queens-pet-flamingos/|archive-date=25 March 2021|access-date=25 March 2021|website=[[The Spokesman-Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based [[Mammal Society]] found that 80 per cent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around.

With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census.

Since the turn of the century the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/forget-tower-hamlets-romford-is-new-east-end-says-cockney-language-study-1-2314662 |title=Forget Tower Hamlets – Romford is new East End, says Cockney language study |first=Ramzy |last=Alwakeel |work=Romford Recorder |location= London |date=2 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/heritage/cockney-dialect-migrated-to-essex-dr-fox-tells-east-end-cockney-festival-1-2298684 |title=Cockney dialect migrated to Essex, Dr Fox tells East End Cockney Festival |first=Mike|last=Brooke |work=The Docklands and East London Advertiser |date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multicultural London English]] (MLE) is a [[multiethnolect]] becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds.

Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,&lt;ref name=london_121&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ |title=Transport for London |publisher=Transport for London |access-date=27 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104235448/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ |archive-date=4 January 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=What We Do|url=https://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do|access-date=25 March 2021|website=[[Transport for London]]|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].&lt;ref name=stat_tfl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055413/http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp |archive-date=19 October 2007 |title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority |access-date=5 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
{{main|Airports of London}}
[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5C Iwelumo-1.jpg|thumb|[[London Heathrow Airport]] is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic. ([[London Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]C is pictured.)]]
London is a major international air transport hub with the [[World's busiest city airport systems by passenger traffic|busiest city airspace in the world]]. Eight airports use the word ''London'' in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, [[Airports of London|various other airports]] also serve London, catering primarily to [[general aviation]] flights.
* [[London Heathrow Airport]], in [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], West London, was for many years the [[World's busiest airport|busiest airport in the world]] for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, [[British Airways]].&lt;ref name="london_135"&gt;{{cite web|date=2020|title=Heathrow Airport Travel Report 2019|url=https://www.heathrow.com/content/dam/heathrow/web/common/documents/company/heathrow-2-0-sustainability/futher-reading/Heathrow-Airport-Travel-Report-2019.pdf|access-date=25 March 2021|website=[[Heathrow]]|publisher=LHR Airports Limited|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.&lt;ref name=london_137&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heathrow-airport-uk.info/heathrow-airport-terminal-5.htm |title=Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 |publisher=TMC Ltd |access-date=27 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430195211/http://www.heathrow-airport-uk.info/heathrow-airport-terminal-5.htm |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai]] gained from Heathrow the leading position in terms of international passenger traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coffey|first=Helen|date=5 February 2018|title=The 10 Busiest Airports in the World|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airports-worlds-busiest-international-passengers-dubai-heathrow-hong-kong-amsterdam-paris-a8194911.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburban====
There are more than 360 [[railway stations]] in the [[London fare zones|London Travelcard Zones]] on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into [[London station group|eighteen terminal stations]], with the exception of the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] trains connecting [[Bedford]] in the north and [[Brighton]] in the south via [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] airports.&lt;ref name="london_127"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/Main.php?sEvent=HomePage |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130091433/http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/Main.php?sEvent=HomePage |archive-date=30 January 2010 |title=First Capital Connect |publisher=First Capital Connect |access-date=27 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; London has Britain's busiest station&amp;nbsp;by number of passengers—[[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]], with over 184&amp;nbsp;million people using the interchange station complex (which includes [[London Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East]] station) each year.&lt;ref name="National Rail Station Usage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529 |title=Rail Station Usage |publisher=Office of Rail Regulation |access-date=24 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705115621/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529 |archive-date=5 July 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tube exits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/modesoftransport/tube/performance/default.asp?onload=entryexit |title=Tube exits |publisher=Transport for London |access-date=24 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514062729/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/modesoftransport/tube/performance/default.asp?onload=entryexit |archive-date=14 May 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rws|Clapham Junction}} is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing.

====Inter-city and international====
[[File:St Pancras Railway Station 2012-06-23.jpg|thumb|[[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] is the main terminal for high-speed [[Eurostar]] and [[High Speed 1]] services, as well as commuter suburban [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] and inter-city [[East Midlands Railway]] services.]]

London is the centre of the [[National Rail]] network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014|title=Rail|url=http://londonfirst.co.uk/our-focus/londons-transport-infrastructure/rail/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083946/http://londonfirst.co.uk/our-focus/londons-transport-infrastructure/rail/|archive-date=7 April 2014|access-date=5 April 2014|website=London First}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] and [[Euston railway station|Euston station]], which are both in London, are the starting points of the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[West Coast Main Line]]—the two main raiway lines in Britain—respectively. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking London with the rest of Britain including [[Aberdeen]], [[Birmingham]], [[Blackpool]], [[Bradford]], [[Brighton]], [[Bristol]], [[Cambridge]], [[Cardiff]], [[Carlisle]], [[Chester]], [[Coventry]], [[Crewe]], [[Derby]], [[Doncaster]], [[Dover]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Exeter]], [[Glasgow]], [[Holyhead]] (for [[Dublin]]), [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[Nottingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Norwich]], [[Oxford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Plymouth]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sheffield]], [[Southampton]], [[Sunderland]], [[Stevenage]], [[Swansea]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[York]].&lt;ref name="untitled"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Smithers|first=Andrew|date=8 December 2020|title=Great Britain National Rail Train Operators|url=https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/TOCs%20AS%20v46%20Dec%202020.pdf|access-date=27 March 2021|website=[[National Rail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London also has convenient rail connections with [[airports]] out of [[Greater London]]. These airports include [[Birmingham Airport]] (via [[Birmingham International railway station]]), [[East Midlands Airport]] (via [[East Midlands Parkway railway station]]), [[Inverness Airport]] (via [[Inverness railway station]]), [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] (via [[Bradford Interchange]] or [[Leeds railway station]]) and [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] (via [[Liverpool South Parkway railway station]]).&lt;ref name=untitled/&gt;

Some international railway services to [[Continental Europe]] were operated during the 20th century as [[boat train]]s, such as the ''[[Admiraal de Ruijter (train)|Admiraal de Ruijter]]'' to [[Amsterdam]] and the ''[[Night Ferry]]'' to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing [[Eurostar]] services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras International]] with [[Lille]], [[Calais]], [[Paris]], [[Disneyland Paris]], [[Brussels]], [[Amsterdam]] and other European tourist destinations via the [[High Speed 1]] rail link and the [[Channel Tunnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=14 November 2007|title=Eurostar arrives in Paris on time|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7093761.stm|access-date=27 March 2021|website=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Southeastern (train operating company)|high-speed domestic]] trains started in June 2009 linking [[Kent]] to London.&lt;ref name="Southeastern Highspeed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/highspeed/ |title=Highspeed |publisher=Southeastern |access-date=5 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501110057/http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/highspeed/ |archive-date=1 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans for a [[High Speed 2|second high speed line]] linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.

====Freight====
Although [[rail freight]] levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and [[landfill]] waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as [[containerisation|container freight]] from the Channel Tunnel and [[English Channel]] ports, and [[nuclear waste]] for [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] at [[Sellafield]].&lt;ref name="Freight Plan"&gt;August 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150529165228/https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/rail-freight-strategy-aug-2007.pdf Rail Freight Strategy], [[London Rail]]&lt;/ref&gt;

London's coach hub is [[Victoria Coach Station]], an [[Art Deco]] building opened in 1932. The coach station was initially run by a group of coach companies under the name of London Coastal Coaches; however, in 1970 the service and station were included in the nationalisation of the country's coach services, becoming part of the National Bus Company. In 1988, the coach station was purchased by London Transport which then became [[Transport for London]].

===Cable car===
London's first and to date only cable car is the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line]], which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the [[River Thames]], and links [[Greenwich Peninsula]] and the [[Royal Docks]] in the east of the city. It is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although the Emirates Air Line fares are not included in the Oyster daily capping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Emirates Air Line: Take a flight over London on the Thames Cable Car|url=https://www.visitbritainshop.com/world/articles/visitor-oyster-card-thames-cable-car/|access-date=26 March 2021|website=www.visitbritainshop.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cost £60 million to build and can carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times. Similar to the [[Santander Cycles]] bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 October 2011|title=Emirates sponsors Thames cable car|language=en-GB|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-15217173|access-date=26 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port and river boats===
The [[Port of London]], once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.&lt;ref name="handling"&gt;{{cite web|date=10 June 2010|title=Provisional Port Statistics 2009|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110203090417/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2009|archive-date=3 February 2011|access-date=26 April 2011|website=[[Department for Transport]]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this cargo passes through the [[Port of Tilbury]], outside the boundary of Greater London.&lt;ref name="handling" /&gt;

===Roads===
Although the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The [[London Inner Ring Road|inner ring road]] (around the city centre), the [[A406 road|North]] and [[A205 road|South Circular]] roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the [[M25 motorway|M25]], just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into [[inner London]]. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]]) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/london-roads-to-nowhere-2207351.html |title=London: Roads to nowhere |date=8 February 2011 |website=The Independent |access-date=28 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at {{convert|117|mi|km|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Highways Agency |date=25 June 2018 |url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/key-roads/m25/ |access-date=25 June 2018 |title=M25 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/70RoYooMF?url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/key-roads/m25/ |archive-date= 25 June 2018 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and [[M1 motorway|M1]] connect London to [[Leeds]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]].

London is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at {{convert|10.6|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=london_147&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mulholland |first1=Hélène |title=Boris Johnson mulls 'intelligent' congestion charge system for London |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/16/boris-johnson-congestion-charge |website=The Guardian |date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]] was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/london-congestion-charge-what-worked-what-didnt-what-next-92478|title=London congestion charge: what worked, what didn't, what next|last=Badstuber|first=Nicole|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=28 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.&lt;ref name="london_146"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6735.aspx |title=Residents |publisher=Transport for London |access-date=7 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503211945/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6735.aspx |archive-date=3 May 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/congestion/|title=Central London Congestion Charging, England|website=Verdict Traffic|language=en-GB|access-date=28 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users, reduce road traffic, increase traffic speeds, and reduce queues;&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Georgina; Button, Kenneth; Noll, Roger G.

Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars&amp;nbsp;– a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.&lt;ref&gt;Table 3 in Santos, Georgina; Button, Kenneth; Noll, Roger G.

London has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s late 14th-century ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' set out for [[Canterbury]] from London—specifically, from the [[The Tabard|Tabard]] inn, [[Southwark]]. [[William Shakespeare]] spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary [[Ben Jonson]] was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'', was set in the city.&lt;ref name="London in Literature"/&gt; ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'' (1722) by [[Daniel Defoe]] is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]].&lt;ref name="London in Literature"/&gt;

The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cullinan (Director)|first=Dr. Nicholas|title=Organisation -National Portrait Gallery|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/about/organisation.php|access-date=26 March 2021|website=[[National Portrait Gallery, London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national gallery of British art is at [[Tate Britain]], originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to [[Tate Modern]], a new gallery housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which was built by the [[Basel]]-based architecture firm of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Herzog &amp; de Meuron - Eleven Stations at Tate Modern|url=https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/126-150/126-tate-modern.html|website=www.herzogdemeuron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
