'''Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher''', &lt;!--NOT "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven"--&gt;{{post-nominals|country=GBR|LG|OM|DStJ|PC|FRS|HonFRSC|commas=on}} ({{nee|'''Roberts'''}}; 13 October 1925{{snd}}8 April 2013) was a British {{citeref|Mason|2013|stateswoman|style=plain}} who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1979 to 1990 and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold that office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the "'''Iron Lady'''", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As prime minister, she implemented policies that became known as [[Thatcherism]].

Thatcher studied chemistry at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], and worked briefly as a research [[chemist]], before becoming a [[barrister]]. She was [[List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election|elected Member of Parliament]] for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]]. [[Edward Heath]] appointed her [[Secretary of State for Education|Secretary of State for Education and Science]] in his [[Heath ministry|1970–1974 government]]. In 1975, she defeated Heath in the [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative Party leadership election]] to become [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. On becoming prime minister after winning the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high [[inflation]] and Britain's struggles in the wake of the [[Winter of Discontent]] and [[Early 1980s recession|an oncoming recession]].{{refn|In her foreword to the [[List of Conservative Party (UK) general election manifestos|Conservative manifesto]] of 1979, she wrote of "a feeling of helplessness, that we are a once great nation that has somehow fallen behind".&lt;ref name="PoliticalStuff.co.uk" /&gt;|group=nb}} Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised [[deregulation]] (particularly of the financial sector), the privatisation of [[state-owned enterprise|state-owned companies]], and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment, until victory in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her [[Landslide victory|landslide]] re-election in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]. She survived an assassination attempt by the [[Provisional IRA]] in the 1984 [[Brighton hotel bombing]] and achieved a political victory against the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] in the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984–85 miners' strike]].

Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], but her subsequent support for the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] ("poll tax") was widely unpopular, and her increasingly [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] views on the [[European Economic Community|European Community]] were not shared by others in her cabinet. She resigned as prime minister and party leader in 1990, after a [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|challenge was launched to her leadership]].{{refn|Winning support from a majority of her party in the first round of votes, Thatcher fell four votes short of the required 15% margin to win the contest outright.  Her fall has been characterised as "a rare [[coup d'état]] at the top of the British politics: the first since [[Lloyd George]] sawed [[Asquith]] off at the knees in 1916."&lt;ref name="Heffer" /&gt;|group=nb}} After retiring from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] in 1992, she was given a [[life peer]]age as Baroness Thatcher (of [[Kesteven]] in the [[County of Lincolnshire]]) which entitled her to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. In 2013, she [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|died of a stroke]] at [[the Ritz Hotel, London]], at the age of 87.

A polarising figure in British politics, Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|historical rankings of British prime ministers]]. Her tenure constituted a [[Political realignment|realignment]] towards [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies in the United Kingdom, with debate over the complicated legacy attributed to Thatcherism persisting into the 21st century.

=== Family and childhood ===
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on 13 October 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire.{{r|whoswho}} Her parents were [[Alfred Roberts]] (1892–1970), from Northamptonshire, and Beatrice Ethel Stephenson (1888–1960), from Lincolnshire.{{r|whoswho}}{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|p=1}} Her father's maternal grandmother, Catherine Sullivan, was born in [[County Kerry]], [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= O'Sullivan |first=Majella |title= Margaret Thatcher's Irish roots lie in Co Kerry|url= https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/margaret-thatchers-irish-roots-lie-in-co-kerry-29185669.html|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|date=10 April 2013|access-date=18 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned a [[tobacconist]]'s and a [[grocery shop]]. In 1938, [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|before the Second World War]], the Roberts family briefly gave sanctuary to a teenage Jewish girl who had [[Jewish refugees from German-occupied Europe in the United Kingdom|escaped Nazi Germany]]. With her {{wikt-lang|en|penfriend|pen-friending|i=-}} elder sister Muriel, Margaret saved pocket money to help pay for the teenager's journey.{{sfnp|Campbell|2011a|p=38–39}}

Alfred was an [[alderman]] and a [[Methodist local preacher]].{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|p=8}} He brought up his daughter as a strict [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodist]],&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite news|first=Maureen |last=Johnson |title=Bible-Quoting Thatcher Stirs Furious Debate |agency=Associated Press |date=28 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; attending the [[Finkin Street Methodist Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filby|first=Eliza|title=God and Mrs. Thatcher: The Battle for Britain's Soul|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/margaret-thatcher-christian-methodism/|access-date=21 April 2018|magazine=[[National Review]]|date=31 October 2015|archive-date=12 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034043/https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/10/margaret-thatcher-christian-methodism/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Margaret was more sceptical; the future scientist told a friend that she could not believe in [[angel]]s, having calculated that they needed a [[breastbone]] six feet long to support wings.{{r|Oxford1}} Alfred came from a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] family but stood (as was then customary in local government) as an [[Independent politician|Independent]]. He served as Mayor of Grantham in 1945–46 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|p=8}}

Margaret Roberts attended [[Huntingtower Road Primary School]] and won a scholarship to [[Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School]], a grammar school.&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;{{Who's Who | author={{interp|Anon.}} | surname = Thatcher | othernames = Baroness, (Margaret Hilda) | id = U37305 | year = 2017 | doi =10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.U37305 |type=was | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|accessed=15 December 2017 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|p=5}} Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking.{{sfnmp|1a1=Beckett|1y=2006|1p=6|2a1=Blundell|2y=2008|2pp=21–22}} She was [[head girl and head boy|head girl]] in 1942–43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kestevengrantham.lincs.sch.uk/kg/about_school/school_aims |title=School aims |publisher=Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School |access-date=9 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128200852/http://kestevengrantham.lincs.sch.uk/kg/about_school/school_aims |archive-date=28 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other students thought of Roberts as the "star scientist", although mistaken advice regarding cleaning ink from [[parquetry]] almost caused [[chlorine gas poisoning]]. In her [[sixth form|upper sixth year]] Roberts was accepted for a scholarship to study chemistry at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], a women's college, starting in 1944. After another candidate withdrew, Roberts entered Oxford in October 1943.{{sfnmp|1a1=Beckett|1y=2006|1p=12|2a1=Blundell|2y=2008|2p=23}}{{r|Oxford1}}

==Early political career==
In the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]] and [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general elections]], Roberts was the Conservative candidate for the Labour seat of [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]]. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate [[Bill Deedes]] recalled: "Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate."{{r|runciman20130606}} She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate.{{sfnmp|1a1=Beckett|1y=2006|1pp=23–24|2a1=Blundell|2y=2008|2p=37}} She lost on both occasions to [[Norman Dodds]], but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000.{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|pp=23–24}} During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951.{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|pp=23–24}}&lt;ref name="Denis Thatcher"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/1434154/Sir-Denis-Thatcher-Bt.html |access-date=6 January 2012 |date=27 June 2003 |title=Sir Denis Thatcher, Bt |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denis funded his wife's studies for the [[bar association|bar]];{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|p=25}} she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation.{{sfnp|Blundell|2008|p=35}} Later that same year their twins [[Carol Thatcher|Carol]] and [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]] were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section.{{sfnmp|1a1=Ogden|1y=1990|1p=70|2a1=Beckett|2y=2006|2p=26|3a1=Aitken|3y=2013|3p=74}}

===Member of Parliament: 1959–1970===
In 1954, Thatcher was defeated when she sought selection to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] candidate for the [[1955 Orpington by-election|Orpington by-election]] of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], in later years stating: "I really just felt the twins were [...] only two, I really felt that it was too soon. I couldn't do that."{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=100}} Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in April 1958 (narrowly beating [[Ian Fraser (Plymouth Sutton MP)|Ian Montagu Fraser]]). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 election]].{{sfnp|Beckett|2006|p=27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41842|page=6433|date=13 October 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for [[backbencher]]s to propose new legislation,{{r|runciman20130606}} Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her [[private member's bill]], the [[Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960]], requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/101055 |title=HC S 2R [Public Bodies (Admission of the Press to Meetings) Bill] (Maiden Speech) |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=5 February 1960 |access-date=8 April 2013 |archive-date=9 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109151758/http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/101055 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aitken|2013|p=91}} In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of [[birching]] as a [[judicial corporal punishment]].{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=134}}

====On the frontbenches====
Thatcher's talent and drive caused her to be mentioned as a future prime minister in her early 20s{{r|runciman20130606}} although she herself was more pessimistic, stating as late as 1970: "There will not be a woman prime minister in my lifetime – the male population is too prejudiced."&lt;ref name="sandbrook20130409"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandbrook|first=Dominic|author-link=Dominic Sandbrook|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22076886|title=Viewpoint: What if Margaret Thatcher had never been?|magazine=BBC News Magazine|date=9 April 2013|access-date=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1961 she was promoted to the [[frontbench]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions|Parliamentary Undersecretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance]] by [[Harold Macmillan]].{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=4}} Thatcher was the youngest woman in history to receive such a post, and among the first [[List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election|MPs elected in 1959]] to be promoted.{{sfnp|Scott-Smith|2003}} After the Conservatives lost the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], she became spokeswoman on Housing and Land, in which position she advocated her party's policy of giving tenants the [[Right to Buy]] their [[council house]]s.{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=64}} She moved to the [[Shadow Treasury]] team in 1966 and, as Treasury spokeswoman, opposed Labour's mandatory price and income controls, arguing they would unintentionally produce effects that would distort the economy.{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=64}}

[[Jim Prior]] suggested Thatcher as a [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] member after the Conservatives' [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 defeat]], but party leader [[Edward Heath]] and Chief Whip [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw]] eventually chose [[Mervyn Pike, Baroness Pike|Mervyn Pike]] as the [[First Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath|Conservative Shadow Cabinet]]'s sole woman member.{{sfnp|Scott-Smith|2003}} At the 1966 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher criticised the high-tax policies of the [[Labour government, 1964–1970|Labour government]] as being steps "not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism", arguing that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work.{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=64}} Thatcher was one of the few Conservative MPs to support [[Leo Abse]]'s bill to decriminalise male homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hansard |access-date=22 October 2020|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jul/05/sexual-offences-no-2|title=Sexual Offences (No. 2)|date=5 July 1966|house=House of Commons|volume=731|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; She voted in favour of [[David Steel]]'s bill to legalise abortion,{{sfnp|Thatcher|1995|p=150}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hansard |access-date=22 October 2020|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jul/22/medical-termination-of-pregnancy-bill|title=Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill|date=22 July 1966|house=House of Commons|volume=732|page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a ban on [[hare coursing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hansard |access-date=22 October 2020|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/may/14/hare-coursing-bill|title=Hare Coursing Bill|date=14 May 1970|house=House of Commons|volume=801|pages=1599–1603}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supported the retention of capital punishment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hansard |access-date=22 October 2020|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/jun/24/capital-punishment|title=Capital Punishment|date=24 June 1969|house=House of Commons|volume=785|page=1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Hansard |access-date=22 October 2020 |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1968/feb/09/divorce-reform-bill|title=Divorce Reform Bill |date=9 February 1968 |house=House of Commons |volume=758 |pages=904–907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Thatcher|1995|p=151}}

====In the Shadow Cabinet====
In 1967, the United States Embassy chose Thatcher to take part in the [[International Visitor Leadership Program]] (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange programme that allowed her to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Although she was not yet a Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future prime minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]], [[Pierre-Paul Schweitzer]] and [[Nelson Rockefeller]].  Following the visit, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet{{sfnp|Scott-Smith|2003}} as Fuel and Power spokeswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatchers-timeline-from-grantham-to-the-house-of-lords-via-arthur-scargill-and-the-8564555.html|title=Margaret Thatcher's timeline: From Grantham to the House of Lords, via Arthur Scargill and the Falklands War|date=8 April 2013|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokeswoman and later to Education.{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=65}}

In 1968, [[Enoch Powell]] delivered his [[Rivers of Blood speech|"Rivers of Blood" speech]] in which he strongly criticised [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immigration to the United Kingdom and the then-proposed [[Race Relations Act 1968|Race Relations Bill]].  When Heath telephoned Thatcher to inform her that he would sack Powell from the Shadow Cabinet, she recalled that she "really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis".  She believed that his main points about Commonwealth immigration were correct and that the selected quotations from his speech had been taken out of context.{{sfnp|Aitken|2013|page=117}}  In a 1991 interview for ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'', Thatcher stated that she thought Powell had "made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms".&lt;ref name="Sandford"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Christopher |last=Sandford |author-link=Christopher Sandford (biographer) |title=To See and to Speak |magazine=[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]] |orig-date=June 2012 issue |url=https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/article/to-see-and-to-speak/ |date=4 December 2017  |access-date=23 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time she gave her first Commons speech as a shadow transport minister and highlighted the need for investment in [[British Rail]].  She argued: "[...] if we build bigger and better roads, they would soon be saturated with more vehicles and we would be no nearer solving the problem."{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=189}}  Thatcher made her first visit to the [[Soviet Union]] in the summer of 1969 as the Opposition Transport spokeswoman, and in October delivered a speech celebrating her ten years in Parliament. In early 1970, she told ''The Finchley Press'' that she would like to see a "reversal of the permissive society".{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|pp=190–191}}

===Education Secretary: 1970–1974===

The Conservative Party, led by Edward Heath, won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was appointed to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Education and Science]]. Thatcher caused controversy when, after only a few days in office, she withdrew Labour's [[Circular 10/65]] which attempted to force [[Comprehensive school (England and Wales)|comprehensivisation]], without going through a consultation process.  She was highly criticised for the speed at which she carried this out.{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=222}} Consequently, she drafted her own new policy ([[Circular 10/70]]), which ensured that local authorities were not forced to go comprehensive. Her new policy was not meant to stop the development of new comprehensives; she said: "We shall [...] expect plans to be based on educational considerations rather than on the comprehensive principle."{{sfnp|Moore|2013|p=215}}

Thatcher supported [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]]'s 1971 proposal for market forces to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should not interfere with funding.{{r|lecher20130408}} The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt [[comprehensive school|comprehensive secondary education]]. Although Thatcher was committed to a tiered [[secondary modern school|secondary modern]]-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools,{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=14}} during her tenure as education secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612&amp;nbsp;proposals (roughly 9 per cent){{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=224}} for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent to 62&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent.{{sfnp|Marr|2007|pp=248–249}} Nevertheless, she managed to save 94 grammar schools.{{sfnp|Moore|2013|p=215}}

{{anchor|Milk Snatcher}}
During her first months in office she attracted public attention due to the government's attempts to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools,{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=14}} while administering public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of [[Education Act 1944|free milk for schoolchildren]] aged seven to eleven.{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=76}} She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk but agreed to provide younger children with ⅓ pint daily for nutritional purposes.{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=76}} She also argued that she was simply carrying on with what the Labour government had started since they had stopped giving free milk to secondary schools.{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=231}} Milk would still be provided to those children that required it on medical grounds, and schools could still sell milk.{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=231}} The aftermath of the milk row hardened her determination; she told the editor-proprietor Harold Creighton of ''[[The Spectator]]'': "Don't underestimate me, I saw how they broke [[Keith Joseph|Keith {{interp|Joseph}}]], but they won't break me."{{sfnp|Campbell|2000|p=288}}

Cabinet papers later revealed that she opposed the policy but had been forced into it by the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-move-swiftly-to-avoid-milksnatcher-tag-2047372.html|title=Tories move swiftly to avoid 'milk-snatcher' tag|last=Hickman|first=Martin|date=9 August 2010|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her decision provoked a storm of protest from Labour and the press,{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=15}} leading to her being notoriously nicknamed "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher".{{sfnp|Wapshott|2007|p=76}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Rebecca|title=How Margaret Thatcher became known as 'Milk Snatcher'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7932963/How-Margaret-Thatcher-became-known-as-Milk-Snatcher.html|access-date=9 April 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph|date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in her autobiography: "I learned a valuable lesson {{interp|from the experience}}.

The [[Heath government]] continued to experience difficulties with [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargoes]] and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]].{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=15}} Labour formed a [[Labour government, 1974–1979|minority government]] and went on to win a narrow majority in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]]. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start.{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=16}} Her main support came from the parliamentary [[1922 Committee]]{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=16}} and ''The Spectator'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosgrave |first=Patrick |author-link=Patrick Cosgrave |title=Clear choice for the Tories |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/04/clear-choice-for-the-tories/ |date=25 January 1975 |publication-date=13 April 2013 |access-date=13 July 2017 |magazine=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Thatcher's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue.{{r|runciman20130606}} She [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|defeated Heath]] on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/thatcher-leads-tributes-to-sir-edward-heath-353gzwv3fdh|url-access=subscription|title=Thatcher leads tributes to Sir Edward Heath|date=18 July 2005|access-date=23 October 2020|newspaper=The Times|first=Philippe|last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. Thatcher's election had a polarising effect on the party; her support was stronger among MPs on the right, and also among those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or [[Oxbridge]].{{sfnp|Cowley|Bailey|2000}}

Television critic [[Clive James]], writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' prior to her election as Conservative Party leader, compared her voice of 1973 to "a cat sliding down a blackboard".{{refn|{{harvtxt|James|1977|pp=119–120}}: &lt;q&gt;The hang-up has always been the voice.

Thatcher began attending lunches regularly at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] (IEA), a think tank founded by {{wikt-lang|en|Hayekian|i=-}} poultry magnate [[Antony Fisher]]; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she was influenced by the ideas of [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]] and [[Arthur Seldon]], and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the [[British welfare state]]. [[Keynesian economics]], they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.{{sfnp|Beckett|2010|loc=chpt. 11}}

Thatcher intended to promote [[neoliberal]] economic ideas at home and abroad. Despite setting the direction of her foreign policy for a Conservative government, Thatcher was distressed by her repeated failure to shine in the House of Commons. Consequently, Thatcher decided that as "her voice was carrying little weight at home", she would "be heard in the wider world".{{sfnp|Campbell |2000|p=344}} Thatcher undertook visits across the Atlantic, establishing an international profile and promoting her economic and foreign policies.

In domestic affairs, Thatcher opposed [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish devolution (home rule)]] and the creation of a [[Scottish Assembly]]. She instructed Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was successfully defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|1979 referendum]] on Scottish devolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/how-thatcher-tried-to-thwart-devolution-1-1165673|title=How Thatcher tried to thwart devolution|date=27 April 2008|access-date=20 April 2013|newspaper=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's economy during the 1970s was so weak that then Foreign Secretary [[James Callaghan]] warned his fellow Labour Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of "a breakdown of democracy", telling them: "If I were a young man, I would emigrate."{{sfnp|Beckett|2010|loc=chpt. 7}} In mid-1978, the economy began to recover, and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility. Now prime minister, Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7 September that there would be no general election that year, and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government "chickens", and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in, criticising Labour for "running scared".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm|title=7 September 1978: Callaghan accused of running scared|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|access-date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour government then faced fresh public unease about the direction of the country and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978–79, dubbed the "[[Winter of Discontent]]". The Conservatives attacked the Labour government's unemployment record, using advertising with the slogan "[[Labour Isn't Working]]". A [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] was called after the Callaghan ministry [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|lost a motion of no confidence]] in early 1979. The Conservatives won a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons, and Thatcher became the first female British prime minister.{{sfnp|Butler|Kavanagh|1980|page=199}}

Thatcher became prime minister on 4 May 1979. Arriving at [[Downing Street]] she said, paraphrasing the [[Prayer of Saint Francis]]:

{{poemquote|
Where there is discord, may we bring harmony;
Where there is error, may we bring truth;
Where there is doubt, may we bring faith;
And where there is despair, may we bring hope.&lt;ref name="Prayer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/104078 |title=Remarks on becoming Prime Minister (St Francis's prayer) |date=4 May 1979 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In office throughout the 1980s, Thatcher was frequently described as the most powerful woman in the world.{{sfnmp|1a1=Bern|1y=1987|1p=43|2a1=Ogden|2y=1990|2pp=9, 12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Gail Sheehy on the most powerful woman in the world |last=Sheehy |first=Gail |author-link=Gail Sheehy |magazine=Vanity Fair |volume=52 |year=1989 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The most powerful woman in the world |last=Eisner |first=Jane |author-link=Jane Eisner |magazine=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] Magazine |asin=B006RKBPBK |date=7 June 1987 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic affairs===
====Minorities====
Thatcher was Opposition leader and prime minister at a time of increased racial tension in Britain. On the [[1977 United Kingdom local elections|local elections of 1977]], ''[[The Economist]]'' commented: "The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties—specifically the [[National Front (UK)|National Front {{interp|NF}}]], which suffered a clear decline from last year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=The Economist|title=Votes go to Tories, and nobody else|date=14 May 1977|volume=263|issue=6976|pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/110797 |title=Conservative Campaign Guide Supplement 1978 |date=1 March 1978 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |access-date=22 October 2020 |page=[https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/93030FB632E147999D4BEB655587A134.pdf#page270 270]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her standing in the polls had risen by 11% after a 1978 interview for ''[[World in Action]]'' in which she said "the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in", as well as "in many ways {{interp|minorities}} add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV Interview for Granada World in Action ('rather swamped')|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/103485 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=27 January 1978 |access-date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Mrs Thatcher fears people might become hostile if immigrant flow is not cut |section=News |date=31 January 1978 |page_number=2 |issue=60224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives had attracted votes from the NF, whose support almost collapsed.{{sfnmp|1a1=Reitan|1y=2003|1p=26|2a1=Ward|2y=2004|2p=128}} In a July 1979 meeting with Foreign Secretary [[Lord Carrington]] and Home Secretary [[William Whitelaw]], Thatcher objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of [[Vietnamese boat people]] allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000 over two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Telegraph |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/margaret-thatcher/6906503/Margaret-Thatcher-complained-about-Asian-immigration-to-Britain.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525084645/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/margaret-thatcher/6906503/Margaret-Thatcher-complained-about-Asian-immigration-to-Britain.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= 25 May 2010|title=Margaret Thatcher complained about Asian immigration to Britain|date=30 December 2009|access-date=20 January 2011|first=Jon|last=Swaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Queen====
As prime minister, Thatcher met weekly with [[Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] to discuss government business, and their relationship came under scrutiny.{{sfnmp|1a1=Reitan|1y=2003|1p=28|2a1=Seward|2y=2001|2p=154}} {{harvtxt|Campbell|2011a|page=464}} states:

{{quote|One question that continued to fascinate the public about the phenomenon of a woman Prime Minister was how she got on with the Queen. The answer is that their relations were punctiliously correct, but there was little love lost on either side. As two women of very similar age – Mrs Thatcher was six months older – occupying parallel positions at the top of the social pyramid, one the head of government, the other head of state, they were bound to be in some sense rivals. Mrs Thatcher's attitude to the Queen was ambivalent. On the one hand she had an almost mystical reverence for the institution of the monarchy [...] Yet at the same time she was trying to modernise the country and sweep away many of the values and practices which the monarchy perpetuated.}}

[[Michael Shea (diplomat)|Michael Shea]], the Queen's press secretary, in 1986 leaked stories of a deep rift to ''The Sunday Times''.  He said that she felt Thatcher's policies were "uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive".{{sfnp|Pimlott|1996|pp=460–463, 484, 509–514}} Thatcher later wrote: "I always found the Queen's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct [...] stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' were just too good not to make up."{{sfnp|Thatcher|1993|p=18}}

====Economy and taxation====
{{Margaret Thatcher/datatable}}
Thatcher's economic policy was influenced by [[monetarist]] thinking and economists such as [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Alan Walters]].{{sfnp|Childs|2006|p=185}} Together with her first [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|chancellor]], [[Geoffrey Howe]], she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes.{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=30}} She increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply, and thereby lower inflation;{{sfnp|Childs|2006|p=185}} introduced cash limits on public spending and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing.{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=30}} Cuts to higher education led to Thatcher being the first Oxford-educated, post-war incumbent without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/29/newsid_2506000/2506019.stm|title=29 January 1985: Thatcher snubbed by Oxford dons|access-date=9 April 2007|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=14 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsEyqSok?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/29/newsid_2506000/2506019.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Heathite Conservatives in the Cabinet, the so-called "[[wets and dries|wets]]", expressed doubt over Thatcher's policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/10/newsid_2541000/2541071.stm|title=10 October 1980: Thatcher 'not for turning'|access-date=21 December 2008|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=14 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsEzgqbP?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/10/newsid_2541000/2541071.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1981 England riots]] resulted in the British media discussing the need for a [[Flip-flop (politics)|policy U-turn]]. At the 1980 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher addressed the issue directly, with a speech written by the playwright [[Ronald Millar]],{{sfnp|Jones|2007|p=224}} that notably included the following lines:{{quote|To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the "U" turn, I have only one thing to say.

By 1982, the UK began to experience signs of economic recovery;{{sfnp|Floud|Johnson|2004|p=392}} inflation was down to 8.6% from a high of 18%, but unemployment was over 3&amp;nbsp;million for the first time since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm|title=26 January 1982: UK unemployment tops three million|access-date=16 April 2010|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=21 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221074348/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%,{{sfnp|Rowthorn|Wells|1987|page=234}} with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3&amp;nbsp;million in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/unemployment-among-young-workers-hits-15-per-cent-1645728.html|title=Unemployment among young workers hits 15 per cent|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 March 2009|access-date=21 November 2010|first=Sean|last=O'Grady|archive-date=14 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsF1C22D?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/unemployment-among-young-workers-hits-15-per-cent-1645728.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1982 Conservative Party Conference, Thatcher said: "We have done more to roll back the frontiers of socialism than any previous Conservative Government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech to Conservative Party Conference|url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105032|date=8 October 1982|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|access-date=7 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said at the Party Conference the following year that the British people had completely rejected [[state socialism]] and understood "the state has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves [...] There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech to Conservative Party Conference|url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105454|date=14 October 1983|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|access-date=7 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1987, unemployment was falling, the economy was stable and strong, and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and [[1987 United Kingdom local elections|local council election]] results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The [[1987 United Kingdom general election|election]] saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge87.shtml|title=11 June 1987|publisher=BBC |work=Politics 97 |access-date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher had been firmly opposed to British membership of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM, a precursor to [[European Economic and Monetary Union]]), believing that it would constrain the British economy,&lt;ref name="ecc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thatcher stands firm against full EMS role|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106969|access-date=8 October 2008|last=Riddell|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Riddell|date=23 November 1987|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the urging of both Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Nigel Lawson]] and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe;{{sfnp|Thatcher|1993|p=712}} in October 1990 she was persuaded by [[John Major]], Lawson's successor as Chancellor, to join the ERM at what proved to be too high a rate.{{sfnp|Marr|2007|p=484}}

Thatcher reformed local government taxes by replacing [[Rates (tax)|domestic rates]] (a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home) with the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident.&lt;ref name="polltax"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DD1030F930A15757C0A966958260|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=30 October 2008|date=23 April 1990|last=Passell|first=Peter|title=Furor Over British Poll Tax Imperils Thatcher Ideology|archive-date=14 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsF3EXbt?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/23/business/furor-over-british-poll-tax-imperils-thatcher-ideology.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year,{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|pp=87–88}} and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership.{{r|polltax}} Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong&lt;ref name="trafalgarsq num"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=David|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-battle-of-trafalgar-square-the-poll-tax-riots-revisited-1926873.html|title=The Battle of Trafalgar Square: The poll tax riots revisited|date=25 March 2010|access-date=8 April 2013|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstration in London in March 1990; the demonstration around [[Trafalgar Square]] deteriorated into [[Poll tax riots|riots]], leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest.&lt;ref name="otd pt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm|title=31 March 1990: Violence flares in poll tax demonstration|access-date=30 October 2008|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=14 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsF3mebv?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community Charge was abolished in 1991 by her successor, John Major.{{r|otd pt}} It has since transpired that Thatcher herself had failed to register for the tax, and was threatened with financial penalties if she did not return her form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Narwan |first1=Gurpreet |title=Threat of fine for unpaid poll tax sent to No 10 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/threat-of-fine-for-unpaid-poll-tax-sent-to-no-10-szqwdrlb6 |url-access=subscription |access-date=22 October 2020 |work=The Times |date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1984, the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174&amp;nbsp;state-owned mines and cut 20,000&amp;nbsp;jobs out of 187,000.&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Glass|title=The Uncivilized Side of Britain Rears its Ugly Head|newspaper=The Record|date=16 December 1984|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=David|title=Still unbowed, ex-miners to mark 25 years since the start of the strike|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/still-unbowed-ex-miners-mark-25-4488387|newspaper=The Journal|date=21 February 2009|access-date=5 July 2017|archive-date=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812022044/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/still-unbowed-ex-miners-mark-25-4488387|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|pits-closed}} Two-thirds of the country's miners, led by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) under [[Arthur Scargill]], downed tools in protest.{{r|Glass}}&lt;ref name="thatcher-num"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3537463.stm|title=Iron Lady versus union baron|access-date=20 November 2008|date=6 March 2004|last=Hannan|first=Patrick|author-link=Patrick Hannan (presenter)|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Jones|title=A History of the Miners' Strike|agency=Press Association|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scargill refused to hold a ballot on the strike,{{sfnp|Adeney|Lloyd|1988|pages=88–89}} having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983).{{sfnp|Adeney|Lloyd|1988|page=169}} This led to the strike being declared illegal by the [[High Court of Justice]].{{sfnp|Adeney|Lloyd|1988|page=170}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=28 September 1984: Pit dispute 'illegal' says judge|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_2540000/2540813.stm|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|access-date=26 December 2012|archive-date=2 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002235052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_2540000/2540813.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher refused to meet the union's demands and compared the miners' dispute to the [[Falklands War]], declaring in a speech in 1984: "We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty."{{sfnp|Khabaz|2006|p=226}} Thatcher's opponents presented her words as indicating contempt for the working class and have been employed in criticism of her ever since.{{sfnp|Moore|2015|p=164}}

After a year out on strike in March 1985, the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5&amp;nbsp;billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the [[Pound sterling|pound]]'s fall against the [[United States dollar|US dollar]].&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Timothy|title=Miners return to work today. Bitter coal strike wrenched British economy, society|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=5 March 1985|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher reflected on the end of the strike in her statement that "if anyone has won" it was "the miners who stayed at work" and all those "that have kept Britain going".{{sfnp|Moore|2015|p=178}}

The government closed 25&amp;nbsp;unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 mines had been closed;{{r|pits-closed}} those that remained were privatised in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3531819.stm|title=UK Coal sees loss crumble to £1m|access-date=20 November 2008|date=4 March 2004|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting closure of 150&amp;nbsp;coal mines, some of which were not losing money, resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and had the effect of devastating entire communities.&lt;ref name="pits-closed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3514549.stm|title=Watching the pits disappear|access-date=20 November 2008|date=5 March 2004|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes had helped bring down Heath's government, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner [[Ian MacGregor]] as NCB leader, and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear contributed to her triumph over the striking miners.{{sfnp|Marr|2007|p=411}}

The number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, when more than 29&amp;nbsp;million working days had been lost. In 1984, the year of the miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27&amp;nbsp;million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990, there were 630 and fewer than 2&amp;nbsp;million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter.{{sfnp|Butler|1994|p=375}} Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985.{{sfnp|Laybourn|1992|page=208}} In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1979 to fewer than 10&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfnp|Barrell|1994|p=127}}

====Privatisation====
The policy of [[privatisation]] has been called "a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism".{{sfnp|Seldon|Collings|2000|p=27}} After the 1983 election the sale of state utilities accelerated;{{sfnp|Feigenbaum|Henig|Hamnett|1998|p=71}} more than £29&amp;nbsp;billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries, and another £18&amp;nbsp;billion from the sale of council houses.{{sfnp|Marr|2007|p=428}} The process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of [[workforce productivity|labour productivity]].{{sfnp|Parker|Martin|1995}}

Some of the privatised industries, including gas, [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|water]], and electricity, were [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership. [[British Steel Corporation]] had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=69687|title=Ian MacGregor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as [[Oftel]] ([[Telecommunications Act 1984|1984]]), [[Ofgas]] ([[Gas Act 1986|1986]]), and the [[National Rivers Authority]] ([[Water Act 1989|1989]]).{{sfnp|Veljanovski|1990|pp=291–304}} There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries.{{sfnp|Parker|Martin|1995}}

In most cases, privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but results overall have been mixed.{{sfnp|McAleese|2004|pp=169–70}} Not all privatised companies have had successful share price trajectories in the longer term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simon |first=Emma |title=Thatcher's legacy: how has privatisation fared? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/shares-and-stock-tips/9989430/Thatchers-legacy-how-has-privatisation-fared.html |work=The Telegraph |date=12 April 2013 |access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review by the IEA states: "it does seem to be the case that once competition and/or effective regulation was introduced, performance improved markedly [...] But I hasten to emphasise again that the literature is not unanimous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Review of Privatisation and Regulation Experience in Britain |url=https://iea.org.uk/publications/research/a-review-of-privatisation-and-regulation-experience-in-britain |publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs |date=7 November 2000 |access-date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher always resisted [[privatisation of British Rail|privatising British Rail]] and was said to have told Transport Secretary [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]]: "Railway privatisation will be the [[wikt:Waterloo#Noun|Waterloo]] of this government. Please never mention the railways to me again." Shortly before her resignation in 1990, she accepted the arguments for privatisation, which her successor John Major implemented in 1994.{{sfnp|Marr|2007|p=495}}

The privatisation of public assets was combined with [[Deregulation#United Kingdom|financial deregulation]] to fuel economic growth. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe abolished the UK's exchange controls in 1979,&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=Jamie |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37751599 |title=How the Big Bang changed the City of London for ever |work=BBC News |date=27 October 2016 |access-date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] of 1986 removed many restrictions on the [[London Stock Exchange]].{{r|Robertson}}

====Northern Ireland====
[[File:Margaret Thatcher on a visit to Northern Ireland.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Margaret and [[Denis Thatcher]] on a visit to Northern Ireland in late 1982]]
In 1980 and 1981, [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland's [[HM Prison Maze|Maze Prison]] carried out [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strikes]] to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed in 1976 by the preceding Labour government.{{r|strike}} [[Bobby Sands]] began the 1981 strike, saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions.&lt;ref name="strike"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm|title=3 October 1981: IRA Maze hunger strikes at an end|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|access-date=5 January 2008|archive-date=13 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113034637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners, having declared "Crime is crime is crime; it is not political",{{r|strike}} Nevertheless, the British government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/111769|title=Was Gerry Adams complicit over hunger strikers?|access-date=23 October 2020|date=5 April 2009|newspaper=The Sunday Times|last=Clarke|first=Liam|via=the Margaret Thatcher Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of Sands and nine others, the strike ended. Some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but not official recognition of political status.{{r|CAIN-hs}} Violence in Northern Ireland escalated significantly during the hunger strikes.{{sfnp|English|2005|pp=207–08}}

On 6 November 1981, Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach [[Garret FitzGerald]] had established the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, a forum for meetings between the two governments.&lt;ref name="CAIN-hs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/chronology.htm|title=The Hunger Strike of 1981 – A Chronology of Main Events|work=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]|publisher=Ulster University|access-date=27 January 2011|archive-date=17 February 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZUeuY0G?url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/chronology.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], which marked the first time a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland.

Thatcher appointed Lord Carrington, an ennobled member of the party and former [[Secretary of State for Defence]], to run the [[Foreign Office]] in 1979.{{sfnp|Sked|Cook|1993|pages=364–422}} Although considered a "wet", he avoided domestic affairs and got along well with Thatcher. One issue was what to do with [[Rhodesia]], where the white-minority had determined to rule the prosperous, black-majority breakaway colony in the face of overwhelming international criticism. With the 1975 [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] collapse in the continent, South Africa (which had been Rhodesia's chief supporter) realised that their ally was a liability; black rule was inevitable, and the Thatcher government brokered a peaceful solution to end the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] in December 1979 via the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. The conference at Lancaster was attended by Rhodesian prime minister [[Ian Smith]], as well as by the key black leaders: [[Muzorewa]], [[Mugabe]], [[Joshua Nkomo|Nkomo]] and [[Tongogara]]. The result was the new Zimbabwean nation under black rule in 1980.{{sfnmp|1a1=Lewis|1y=1980|2a1=Soames|2y=1980}}

====Cold War====
Thatcher's first foreign-policy crisis came with the 1979 [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a [[détente]] policy and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the [[1980 Moscow Olympics]]. She gave weak support to US president Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties.{{sfnp|Lahey|2013}} Thatcher nevertheless gave the go-ahead for [[Whitehall]] to approve [[MI6]] (along with the SAS) to undertake "disruptive action" in Afghanistan.{{sfnp|Dorril|2002|p={{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/mi6insidecovertw00dorr/page/752|752&amp;nbsp;{{closed access}} }}}} As well working with the CIA in [[Operation Cyclone]], they also supplied weapons, training and intelligence to the ''[[mujaheddin]]''.{{sfnp|Cormac|2018|pages=233–36}}

Thatcher was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Following Reagan–Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that "We're not in a Cold War now", but rather in a "new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was".&lt;ref name="reforms1988"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1738F93BA25752C1A96E948260|title=Gorbachev Policy Has Ended The Cold War, Thatcher Says|date=18 November 1988|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=30 October 2008|archive-date=11 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111173109/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/18/world/gorbachev-policy-has-ended-the-cold-war-thatcher-says.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met with Gorbachev and Council of Ministers chairman [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]].{{sfnp|Zemcov|Farrar|1989|page=138}}

====Ties with the US====

Despite opposite personalities, Thatcher bonded quickly with US president [[Ronald Reagan]].{{refn|{{harvtxt|Cannadine|2017}}: &lt;q&gt;In many ways they were very different figures: he was sunny, genial, charming, relaxed, upbeat, and with little intellectual curiosity or command of policy detail; she was domineering, belligerent, confrontational, tireless, hyperactive, and with an unrivalled command of facts and figures. But the chemistry between them worked. Reagan had been grateful for her interest in him at a time when the British establishment refused to take him seriously; she agreed with him about the importance of creating wealth, cutting taxes, and building up stronger defences against Soviet Russia; and both believed in liberty and free-market freedom, and in the need to outface what [[Evil Empire speech|Reagan would later call 'the evil empire']].&lt;/q&gt;|group=nb}} She gave strong support to the [[Reagan Doctrine|Reagan administration's Cold War policies]] based on their shared [[Anti-communism|distrust of communism]].{{r|thatcher-cw}} A sharp disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult with her on the [[invasion of Grenada]].{{sfnp|Williams|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |type=Obituary|title= Ronald Reagan |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/111260 |newspaper=The Times |via=the Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=6 June 2004 |access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crisis in the Falklands====
{{See also|Rejoice (Margaret Thatcher)|label1="Rejoice"|Gould–Thatcher exchange|label2=the Gould exchange}}
On 2 April 1982, the ruling [[National Reorganization Process|military junta in Argentina]] ordered the invasion of the British possessions of the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], [[Events leading to the Falklands War|triggering the Falklands War]].{{sfnp|Smith|1989|p=21}} The [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|subsequent crisis]] was "a defining moment of {{interp|Thatcher's}} premiership".{{sfnp|Jackling|2005|p=230}} At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Robert Armstrong]],{{sfnp|Jackling|2005|p=230}} she set up and chaired a small [[War cabinet#Falklands War|War Cabinet]] (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to oversee the conduct of the war,{{sfnp|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|pp=80–81}} which by 5–6 April had authorised and dispatched a [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|naval task force]] to retake the islands.{{sfnp|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|p=95}} Argentina [[Argentine surrender in the Falklands War|surrendered on 14 June]] and ''Operation Corporate'' was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255&amp;nbsp;British servicemen and 3&amp;nbsp;Falkland Islanders. Argentine fatalities totalled 649, half of them after the nuclear-powered submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} torpedoed and sank the cruiser {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano}} on 2 May.&lt;ref name="liberation"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Falklands: 25 years since the Iron Lady won her war|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-falklands-25-years-since-the-iron-lady-won-her-war-v3dp2zx3h5h|newspaper=The Times|date=15 June 2007|first=Michael|last=Evans|url-access=subscription|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands' defence that led to the war, and especially by Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]] in Parliament for the decision to torpedo the ''General Belgrano'', but overall she was considered a competent and committed war leader.{{sfnp|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|pp=335–336}} The "[[Falklands factor]]", an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to Thatcher's second election victory in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]].{{sfnp|Sanders|Ward|Marsh|1987}} Thatcher frequently referred after the war to the "Falklands spirit";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Simon|author-link=Simon Jenkins|title=Falklands war 30 years on and how it turned Thatcher into a world celebrity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/01/falklands-war-thatcher-30-years|access-date=26 May 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|p=329}} suggests that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision-making of her War Cabinet over the painstaking deal-making of peacetime [[cabinet government]].

====Negotiating Hong Kong====
In September 1982 she visited China to discuss with [[Deng Xiaoping]] the [[sovereignty of Hong Kong]] after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited, and she was the first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's sovereignty over Hong Kong was non-negotiable but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with the British government through formal negotiations. Both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.{{sfnp|Yahuda|1996|page=155}} After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.{{sfnp|Reitan|2003|p=116}}

In March 1990, Thatcher held a Chequers seminar on the subject of German reunification that was attended by members of her cabinet and historians such as [[Norman Stone]], [[George Urban]], [[Timothy Garton Ash]] and [[Gordon A.

During her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average approval rating (40%) of any post-war prime minister. Since Nigel Lawson's resignation as Chancellor in October 1989,{{sfnp|Crewe|1991}} polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party.&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ridley|first=Matt|author-link=Matt Ridley|date=25 November 1990|title=Et Tu, Heseltine?; Unpopularity Was a Grievous Fault, and Thatcher Hath Answered for It|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1160505.html|url-status=dead|access-date=5 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831000325/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1160505.html|archive-date=31 August 2017|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted that she did not care about her poll ratings and pointed instead to her unbeaten election record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times|articlename=The poll tax incubus|section=Editorials/Leaders|date=24 November 1990|page_number=13|issue=63872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1989, Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by the little-known backbench MP [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Sir Anthony Meyer]].&lt;ref name="89election"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm|access-date=1 November 2008|title=5 December 1989: Thatcher beats off leadership rival|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=7 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307113658/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 374 Conservative MPs eligible to vote, 314 voted for Thatcher and 33 for Meyer. Her supporters in the party viewed the result as a success and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within the party.{{r|89election}}

Opinion polls in September 1990 reported that Labour had established a 14% lead over the Conservatives,{{r|howe}} and by November, the Conservatives had been trailing Labour for 18&amp;nbsp;months.{{r|ridley}} These ratings, together with Thatcher's combative personality and tendency to override collegiate opinion, contributed to further discontent within her party.{{r|resign-nyt}}

In July 1989, Thatcher removed Geoffrey Howe as [[Foreign Secretary|foreign secretary]] after he and Lawson had forced her to agree to a plan for Britain to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM). Britain joined the ERM in October 1990. On 1 November 1990, Howe, by then the last remaining member of Thatcher's original 1979 cabinet, resigned from his position as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|deputy prime minister]], ostensibly over her open hostility to moves towards [[European Monetary Union]].&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/1/newsid_2513000/2513953.stm|access-date=1 November 2008|title=1 November 1990: Howe resigns over Europe policy|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=7 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307114118/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/1/newsid_2513000/2513953.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Millership|first=Peter|title=Thatcher's Deputy Quits in Row over Europe|agency=Reuters|date=1 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his resignation speech on 13 November, which was instrumental in Thatcher's downfall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Sir Geoffrey Howe's resignation was fatal blow in Mrs Thatcher's political assassination |author=[[Alan Walters|Walters, Alan]] |section=News |date=5 December 1990 |page_number=12 |issue=63881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howe attacked Thatcher's openly dismissive attitude to the government's proposal for a new European currency competing against existing currencies (a "hard [[European Currency Unit|ECU]]"):

Thatcher was replaced as head of government and party leader by Chancellor John Major, whose lead over Heseltine in the second ballot was sufficient for Heseltine to drop out.

After [[Tony Blair]]'s [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|election as Labour Party leader]] in 1994, Thatcher praised Blair as "probably the most formidable [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] since [[Hugh Gaitskell]]", adding: "I see a lot of socialism behind their front bench, but not in Mr Blair.

At the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Thatcher supported the Conservative campaign, as she had done in 1992 and 1997, and in the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative leadership election]] following its defeat, she endorsed [[Iain Duncan Smith]] over [[Kenneth Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter supporting Iain Duncan Smith for the Conservative leadership published in the ''Daily Telegraph''|date=21 August 2001|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|access-date=9 April 2007|archive-date=20 May 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67nC0623P?url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 she encouraged [[George W.

She broached the same subject in her ''[[Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World]]'', which was published in April 2002 and dedicated to Ronald Reagan, writing that there would be no peace in the Middle East until [[Saddam]] was toppled. Her book also said that Israel must trade [[land for peace]] and that the European Union (EU) was a "fundamentally unreformable", "classic utopian project, a monument to the vanity of intellectuals, a programme whose inevitable destiny is failure".{{sfnp|Glover|Economides|2010|page=20}} She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else [[Brexit|leave the EU]] and join the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/mar/18/uk.eu|title=Britain must quit EU, says Thatcher|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|author-link=Patrick Wintour|date=18 March 2002|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Thatcher criticised how Blair had decided to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]] two years previously. Although she still supported the intervention to topple Saddam Hussein, she said that (as a scientist) she would always look for "facts, evidence and proof" before committing the armed forces.{{r|grice}} She celebrated her 80th birthday on 13 October at the [[Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London|Mandarin Oriental Hotel]] in [[Hyde Park, London]]; guests included the Queen, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] and Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4329132.stm|title=Thatcher marks 80th with a speech|access-date=1 November 2008|date=13 October 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Howe, Baron Howe of Aberavon]], was also in attendance and said of his former leader: "Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4337404.stm|access-date=1 November 2008|date=13 October 2005|title=Birthday tributes to Thatcher|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcherism represented a systematic and decisive overhaul of the [[post-war consensus]], whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]], nationalised industry, and close regulation of the economy, and high taxes. Thatcher generally supported the welfare state while proposing to rid it of abuses.{{refn|{{harvtxt|Moore|2013|p=87}}: &lt;q&gt;Neither at the beginning of her career nor when she was prime minister, did Margaret Thatcher ever reject the wartime foundations of the welfare state, whether in health, social policy or education. In this she was less radical than her critics or some of her admirers supposed. Her concern was to focus more on abuse of the system, on bureaucracy and union militancy, and on the growth of what later came to be called the dependency culture, rather than on the system itself.&lt;/q&gt;|group=nb}}

She promised in 1982 that the highly popular [[National Health Service]] was "safe in our hands".{{sfnp|Klein|1985}} At first she ignored the question of privatising nationalised industries. Heavily influenced by right-wing think tanks, and especially by [[Sir Keith Joseph]],{{sfnp|Marr|2007|p=358}} Thatcher broadened her attack. Thatcherism came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including [[moral absolutism]], [[nationalism]], [[Individualism|interest in the individual]], and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590098/Margaret-Thatcher|last=Young|first=Hugo|author-link=Hugo Young|title=Margaret Thatcher profile|encyclopaedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=n.d.|access-date=30 October 2008|archive-date=31 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031211708/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590098/Margaret-Thatcher|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Thatcher: the economic achievements and legacy of Thatcherism|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9979362/Margaret-Thatcher-the-economic-achievements-and-legacy-of-Thatcherism.html|last=Bootle|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Bootle|work=The Telegraph|date=8 April 2013|access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|{{harvtxt|Lawson|1992|p=64}} lists the Thatcherite ideals as "a mixture of free markets, financial discipline, firm control over public expenditure, tax cuts, nationalism, 'Victorian values' (of the [[Samuel Smiles]] self-help variety), privatisation and a dash of populism".|group=nb}}

Thatcher defined her own political philosophy, in a major and controversial break with the [[one-nation conservatism|"one-nation" conservatism]]{{sfnp|Campbell|2011a|pages=530–532}} of her predecessor Edward Heath, in a 1987 interview published in ''[[Woman's Own]]'' magazine:

{{quote|I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" or "I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!" "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview for ''Woman's Own'' ('no such thing as society') with journalist Douglas Keay|date=23 September 1987|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|access-date=10 April 2007|archive-date=27 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427052051/http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Overview====
The number of adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, and more than a million families bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in [[owner-occupier]]s from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.{{sfnp|Marr|2007|p=430}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22079683 |title=What is Thatcherism? |work= BBC News |date= 10 April 2013 |access-date= 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Thatcher years" were also marked by periods of high unemployment and social unrest,&lt;ref name="legacy-bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Evaluating Thatcher's legacy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3681973.stm|work=BBC News|date=4 May 2004|access-date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Thatcher years in statistics |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22070491 |date=9 April 2013 |work=BBC News |access-date=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many critics on the left of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as [[drug abuse]] and family breakdown.{{sfnp|Richards|2004|p=63}} Unemployment did not fall below its May 1979 level during her tenure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22073527|title=Margaret Thatcher: How the economy changed|date=8 April 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; only marginally falling below its April 1979 level in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denman|first1=James|last2=McDonald|first2=Paul|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-trends--discontinued-/january-1996/unemployment-since-1881.pdf|title=Unemployment statistics from 1881 to the present day|date=January 1996|access-date=16 May 2017|publisher=[[Government Statistical Service]]|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Industrialists split over Thatcher legacy|url=https://www.ft.com/content/959ebdda-a2cf-11e2-bd45-00144feabdc0|url-access=subscription |date=12 April 2013 |newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Campbell|2011a|page=79}}

Speaking in Scotland in 2009, Thatcher insisted she had no regrets and was right to introduce the poll tax and withdraw subsidies from "outdated industries, whose markets were in terminal decline", subsidies that created "the culture of dependency, which had done such damage to Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Thatcher: I did right by Scots|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/margaret-thatcher-i-did-right-by-scots-bwjjcdbwbx9|newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=26 April 2009|first=Jason|last=Allardyce|url-access=subscription|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political economist [[Susan Strange]] termed the neoliberal financial growth model "casino capitalism", reflecting her view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry.{{sfnp|Gamble|2009|p=16}}

Thatcher did "little to advance the political cause of women" either within her party or the government.{{sfnp|Evans|2004|p=25}} {{harvtxt|Burns|2009|p=234}} states that some [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|British feminists]] regarded her as "an enemy". {{harvtxt|Purvis|2013}} says that, although Thatcher had struggled laboriously against the sexist prejudices of her day to rise to the top, she made no effort to ease the path for other women. Thatcher did not regard [[women's rights]] as requiring particular attention as she did not, especially during her premiership, consider that women were being deprived of their rights. She had once suggested the shortlisting of women by default for all public appointments yet had also proposed that those with young children ought to leave the workforce.{{sfnp|Gelb|1989|pages=58–59}}

&lt;!-- Please keep text relating to immigration in one paragraph. Discuss at talk if you would prefer to have this paragraph reduced. --&gt;
Thatcher's stance on [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] in the late 1970s was perceived as part of a rising racist public discourse,{{sfnp|Witte|2014|page=54}} which {{harvtxt|Barker|1981}} terms "[[new racism]]".{{sfnp|Chin|2009|p=92}} In opposition, Thatcher believed that the National Front (NF) was winning over large numbers of Conservative voters with warnings against floods of immigrants. Her strategy was to undermine the NF narrative by acknowledging that many of [[Support base of the National Front (UK)|their voters]] had serious concerns in need of addressing. In 1978 she criticised Labour's immigration policy to attract voters away from the NF to the Conservatives.{{sfnp|Witte|2014|pages=53–54}} Her rhetoric was followed by an increase in Conservative support at the expense of the NF. Critics on the left accused her of [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]] to racism.{{sfnp|Friedman|2006|page=13}}{{refn|group=nb|{{harvtxt|Mitchell|Russell|1989}} posits that she had been misinterpreted and that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] was never a focus of Thatcherism. By the 1980s, both the Conservatives and Labour had taken similar positions on immigration policy;{{sfnmp|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=128|2a1=Vinen|2y=2009|2pp=227, 279}} the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] was passed with cross-party support.{{sfnp|Hansen|2000|pages=207–208}} There were no policies passed or proposed by ministers to restrict legal immigration, nor would Thatcher highlight the subject of race in any of her later remarks.{{sfnp|Anwar|2001}}}}

 |quote  = Margaret Thatcher was not merely the first woman and the longest-serving Prime Minister of modern times, but the most admired, most hated, most idolised and most vilified public figure of the second half of the twentieth century. To some she was the saviour of her country who [...] created a vigorous enterprise economy which twenty years later was still outperforming the more regulated economies of the Continent. To others, she was a narrow ideologue whose hard-faced policies legitimised greed, deliberately increased inequality [...] and destroyed the nation's sense of solidarity and civic pride.

Thatcher was the subject or the inspiration for 1980s [[protest song]]s. Musicians [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Paul Weller]] helped to form the [[Red Wedge]] collective to support Labour in opposition to Thatcher.&lt;ref name="songs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3682281.stm|title=Rocking against Thatcher|work=BBC News|date=4 May 2004|last=Heard|first=Chris|access-date=2 August 2011|archive-date=11 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311130019/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3682281.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as "Maggie" by supporters and opponents alike, the chant song "[[Maggie Out]]" became a signature rallying cry among the left during the latter half of her premiership.{{sfnmp|1a1=Vinen|1y=2009|1pp=1947–1948|2a1=Barr|2y=2013|2pp=178, 235}}

Wells parodied Thatcher in several media. He collaborated with [[Richard Ingrams]] on the spoof "[[Dear Bill]]" letters, which ran as a column in ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine; they were also published in book form and became a West End stage revue titled ''Anyone for Denis?'', with Wells in the role of Thatcher's husband. It was followed by a [[Anyone for Denis? (video)|1982 TV special]] directed by [[Dick Clement]], in which Thatcher was played by [[Angela Thorne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anyone for Denis?|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/4789|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=19 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724114429/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/4789|archive-date=24 July 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refn|group=nb|name=Campbell|{{harvtxt|Campbell|2011a|p=800}} also writes about a third view that can be argued: Thatcher "achieved much less" than she and her "[[dries]]" would claim; she failed to curb public spending, diminish or privatise the [[welfare state]], change fundamental attitudes of the general public, or "enhance" freedom where she had instead [[Centralisation|centralised]] control over "many areas of national life".}}
