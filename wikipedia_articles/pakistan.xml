It is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population|fifth-most populous country]], with a population exceeding 225.2 million, and has the world's [[Islam by country#Countries|second-largest Muslim population]]. Pakistan is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|33rd-largest country by area]], spanning {{convert|881,913|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}. It has a {{convert|1,046|km|mi|adj=mid|abbr=off}} coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]] and [[Gulf of Oman]] in the south, and is bordered by [[India]] to [[India–Pakistan border|the east]], [[Afghanistan]] to [[Durand Line|the west]], [[Iran]] to [[Iran–Pakistan border|the southwest]], and [[China]] to [[China–Pakistan border|the northeast]]. It is separated narrowly from [[Tajikistan]] by Afghanistan's [[Wakhan Corridor]] in the north, and also shares a maritime border with [[Oman]].

Pakistan is the site of [[History of Pakistan|several ancient cultures]], including the 8,500-year-old [[Neolithic]] site of [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Coningham |first1=Robin |author1-link=Robin Coningham |last2=Young |first2=Ruth |title=The Archaeology of South Asia: From the Indus to Asoka, c. 6500 BCE – 200 CE |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2015}} Quote: ""Mehrgarh remains one of the key sites in South Asia because it has provided the earliest known undisputed evidence for farming and pastoral communities in the region, and its plant and animal material provide clear evidence for the ongoing manipulation, and domestication, of certain species. Perhaps most importantly in a South Asian context, the role played by zebu makes this a distinctive, localised development, with a character completely different to other parts of the world. Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800—2000&amp;nbsp;BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984)."&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] of the [[Bronze Age]], the most extensive of the civilisations of the [[Old World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wright |first=Rita P. |title=The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MG2ztAEACAAJ |quote=The Indus civilisation is one of three in the 'Ancient East' that, along with Mesopotamia and Pharaonic Egypt, was a cradle of early civilisation in the Old World (Childe, 1950). Mesopotamia and Egypt were longer lived, but coexisted with Indus civilisation during its florescence between 2600 and 1900&amp;nbsp;B.C. Of the three, the Indus was the most expansive, extending from today's northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and India. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |pages=1–2 |isbn=978-0-521-57219-4}}&lt;br&gt;- {{citation |last1=Allchin |first1=Bridget |last2=Allchin |first2=Raymond |title=The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC&amp;pg=PA131 |quote=|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |page=131 |isbn=978-0-521-28550-6}} Quote: "During the second half of the fourth and early part of the third millennium B.C., a new development begins to become apparent in the greater Indus system, which we can now see to be a formative stage underlying the Mature Indus of the middle and late third millennium. This development seems to have involved the whole Indus system, and to a lesser extent the Indo-Iranian borderlands to its west, but largely left untouched the subcontinent east of the Indus system. (page 81)"&lt;/ref&gt; The region that comprises the modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]; briefly that of [[Empire of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great]]; the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]], the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wynbrandt |first=James |title=A Brief History of Pakistan |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofpa0000wynb |url-access=registration |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-6184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in its southern regions, the [[Hindu Shahi]], the [[Ghaznavids]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spuler |first=Bertold |title=The Muslim World: a Historical Survey |date=1969 |publisher=E.J.

Spurred by the [[Pakistan Movement]], which sought a homeland for the [[Muslims]] of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], and election victories in 1946 by the [[All-India Muslim League]], Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the [[Partition of India|Partition of the British Indian Empire]], which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Copland|first=Ian|title=India, 1885-1947: The Unmaking of an Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dw1uAAAAMAAJ|series=Seminar Studies in History|year=2001|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0-582-38173-5}} Quote: "However, the real turning point for the new Muslim League came with the general election of December 1945 and January 1946.  Despite facing a rejuvenated Congress, the League won four-fifths of all the Muslim-reserved seats ...

But, even for those who survived, fear generated a widespread perception that one could be safe only among members of one's own community; and this in turn helped consolidate loyalties towards the state, whether India or Pakistan, in which one might find a secure haven. This was especially important for Pakistan, where the succour it offered to Muslims gave that state for the first time a visible territorial reality.

It references the word {{wikt-lang|fa|پاک}} (''pāk''), meaning "pure" in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Pashto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Pashto |last=Raverty |first=Henry George |url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1478.raverty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suffix {{wikt-lang|fa|ـستان}} (transliterated in English as [[-stan|'''stân''' after stem word ending in a vowel; '''estân''' or '''istân''' after a stem ending in a consonant]]) is from Persian, and means "a place abounding in"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hayyim|first=Sulayman|title=New Persian-English Dictionary|chapter-url= https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?qs=ستان&amp;searchhws=yes |chapter=ستان|page=30|volume=2|location=Tehran|publisher= Librairie imprimerie Béroukhim}} |quote= ستان (p.

The name of the country was coined in 1933 by [[Choudhry Rahmat Ali]], a [[Pakistan Movement]] activist, who published it in a pamphlet ''[[Pakistan Declaration|Now or Never]]'', using it as an [[acronym]] ("thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKISTAN"), and referring to the names of the five northern regions of the [[British Raj]]: [[Punjab Province (British India)|''P''unjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|''A''fghania]], [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|''K''ashmir]], [[Sind Province (1936–55)|''S''indh]], and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Baluchis''tan'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Choudhary Rahmat Ali |title=Now or never: Are we to live or perish for ever? |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/txt_rahmatali_1933.html|access-date=4 December 2007 |date=28 January 1933 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire was hastened by the emergence of the rival powers of the [[Maratha Confederacy]] and later the [[Sikh Empire]], as well as invasions by [[Nader Shah]] from Iran in 1739 and the [[Durrani Empire]] of Afghanistan in 1759.  The growing political power of the British in Bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern Pakistan.

None of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when [[Karachi]], then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was [[History of Karachi#Company rule|taken]], and held as an enclave with a port and [[Karachi Cantonment|military base]] for the [[First Afghan War]] that soon followed. The rest of [[Sindh]] was taken in 1843, and in the following decades, first the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and then after the post-[[Sepoy Mutiny]] (1857–1858) direct rule of [[Queen Victoria]] of the [[British Empire]], took over most of the country partly through wars, and also treaties.  The main wars were that against the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] [[Talpur dynasty]], ended by the [[Battle of Miani]] (1843) in Sindh, the [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]] (1845–1849) and the [[Anglo-Afghan War]]s (1839–1919).  By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the [[British Indian Empire]], and remained so until independence in 1947.

Under the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the [[Sind Division]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]], and the [[Baluchistan Agency]].  There were various [[princely state]]s, of which the largest was [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]].

The [[1946 Indian provincial elections|1946 elections]] resulted in the Muslim League winning 90&amp;nbsp;percent of the seats reserved for Muslims. Thus, the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite in which the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan, a plebiscite won by the Muslim League. This victory was assisted by the support given to the Muslim League by the support of the landowners of Sindh and Punjab. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], which initially denied the Muslim League's claim of being the sole representative of Indian Muslims, was now forced to recognise the fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTMy0B9OZjAC&amp;pg=PA68 |title=Pakistan: A Global Studies Handbook |last=Mohiuddin |first=Yasmin Niaz |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-85109-801-9|page=70 |quote=In the elections of 1946, the Muslim League won 90 percent of the legislative seats reserved for Muslims.

Even Congress, which had always denied the League's claim to be the only true representative of Indian Muslims had to concede the truth of that claim. The 1946 election was, in effect, a plebiscite among Muslims on Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Rule|British]] had no alternative except to take Jinnah's views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of the entirety of British India's Muslims.

In 1969, Jawed conducted a survey on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that just over 60% in the East wing professed to have a secular national identity. However, in the West wing, the same figure professed an Islamic and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in the East wing described their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not in terms of Islam.

The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a [[monsoon]] season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. There are four distinct seasons in Pakistan: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt; Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Pakistan-CLIMATE.html |title=Pakistan Climate |publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations |date=28 March 2008|access-date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flora and fauna ===
{{Main|Flora of Pakistan|Fauna of Pakistan}}
The diversity of the landscape and climate in Pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish. The forests range from coniferous [[alpine plant|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as [[spruce]], [[pine]], and [[deodar cedar]] in the extreme northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees in most of the country (for example, the mulberry-like [[Dalbergia sissoo|shisham]] found in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]), to palms such as [[coconut]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]] in the southern Punjab, southern Balochistan, and all of Sindh. The western hills are home to [[juniper]], [[tamarisk]], coarse grasses, and scrub plants. [[Mangrove]] forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225000128/http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php |archive-date=25 December 2004 |title=Conservation of Mangrove Forests in the Coastal Areas of Sindh and Balochistan |website=WWF Pakistan|access-date=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coniferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1,000|to|4000|m|abbr=off}} in most of the northern and northwestern highlands. In the [[xeric]] regions of Balochistan, date palm and ''[[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]]'' are common.

The first successful [[2013 Pakistani general election|democratic transition]] occurred in May 2013. [[Politics in Pakistan]] is centred on, and dominated by, a homegrown [[social philosophy]] comprising a blend of ideas from [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialism]], [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservatism]], and the [[Third Way|third way]]. As of the [[2013 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 2013, the three main political parties in the country are: the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative]] [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League-N]]; the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialist]] PPP; and the [[Centre politics|centrist]] and [[Third way politics|third-way]] [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|Pakistan Movement for Justice]] (PTI).
* [[Head of State]]: The [[President of Pakistan|President]], who is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] is the ceremonial head of the state and is the civilian [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] (with the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] as principal military adviser), but military appointments and key confirmations in the armed forces are made by the [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] after reviewing the reports on candidates' merit and performance. Almost all appointed officers in the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|judicature]], [[Pakistani military|military]], the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|chairman joint chiefs]], [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|joint staff]], and legislature require the executive confirmation from the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], whom the President must consult by law. However, the powers to pardon and grant clemency lie with the [[President of Pakistan]].
* [[Legislative]]: The [[bicameral]] legislature comprises a 104-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] ([[Upper House|upper house]]) and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] ([[Lower House|lower house]]). [[Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan|Members]] of the National Assembly are elected through the [[first-past-the-post]] system under [[universal adult suffrage]], representing electoral districts known as National Assembly [[Constituencies of Pakistan|constituencies]]. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. Senate members are elected by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having equal representation.
[[File:A night side view of Prime Minister's Secretariat Building.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prime Minister's Office (Pakistan)|Prime Minister's Office]]]]
* Executive: The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] is usually the leader of the [[majority rule]] party or a coalition in the [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]]— the [[lower house]]. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] serves as the [[head of government]] and is designated to exercise as the country's chief executive. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] is responsible for appointing a [[Cabinet of Pakistan|cabinet]] consisting of ministers and advisers as well as running the government operations, taking and authorising executive decisions, appointments and recommendations of [[Central Superior Services|senior civil servants]] that require executive confirmation of the Prime Minister.
* [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|Provincial governments]]: Each of the [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces]] has a similar [[List of Chief Ministers in Pakistan|system of government]], with a [[Elections in Pakistan|directly elected]] [[:Category:Provincial Assemblies of Pakistan|Provincial Assembly]] in which the leader of the largest party or coalition is elected [[Chief Minister (Pakistan)|Chief Minister]]. Chief Ministers oversee the [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|provincial governments]] and head the provincial cabinet. It is common in Pakistan to have different ruling parties or coalitions in each of the provinces. The provincial bureaucracy is headed by the [[Chief Secretary (Pakistan)|Chief Secretary]], who is appointed by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]]. The provincial assemblies have power to make laws and approve the provincial budget which is commonly presented by the provincial finance minister every fiscal year. [[List of Governors of Pakistan|Provincial governors]] who are the ceremonial heads of the provinces are appointed by the [[President of Pakistan|President]].&lt;ref name="ciafactbook" /&gt;
[[File:Supreme Court of Pakistan, Islamabad by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]]]
* [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judicature]]: The [[Court system of Pakistan|judiciary]] of Pakistan is a hierarchical system with two classes of courts: the superior (or higher) judiciary and the subordinate (or lower) judiciary. The [[Chief Justice of Pakistan]] is the [[chief judge]] who oversees the judicature's [[Court system of Pakistan|court system]] at all levels of command. The superior judiciary is composed of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]], the [[Federal Shariat Court]] and five [[High Courts of Pakistan|High Courts]], with the Supreme Court at the apex. The [[Constitution of Pakistan]] entrusts the superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, protect and defend the constitution. Other regions of [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] have separate court systems.

Pakistani efforts on behalf of Indonesia (1948), Algeria (1948–1949), Tunisia (1948–1949), Morocco (1948–1956) and Eritrea (1960–1991) were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pakistan also masterminded an attack on the Afghan city of [[Jalalabad]] during the [[Afghan Civil War (1989–92)|Afghan Civil War]] to establish an Islamic government there.

[[File:Kashmir map.jpg|thumb|200px|The areas shown in green are the Pakistani-controlled areas.]]
The [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]]—the most northwesterly region of South Asia—is a major [[Kashmir problem|territorial dispute]] that has hindered [[India Pakistan relations|relations]] between India and Pakistan. The [[India and Pakistan|two nations]] have fought at least [[India Pakistan Wars|three large-scale]] conventional wars in successive years in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]]. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|conflict]] in 1971 witnessed Pakistan's unconditional [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|surrender]] and a [[Simla Agreement|treaty]] that subsequently led to the [[independence of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raza |first1=Maroof |title=Wars and no peace over Kashmir |date=1996 |publisher=Lancer Publishers |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-1-897829-16-5 |page=170 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WyMwkTA9TyoC&amp;pg=PA58|chapter=§Implications of 1971 war and India's nuclear explosion |quote=In December 1971, Pakistan lost half its country, and with over ~90,000 troops of its military becoming [[Prisoner of War|POWs]], all its earlier myth could not survive this no longer&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other serious military engagements and skirmishes have included the armed contacts in [[Siachen conflict|Siachen Glacier]] (1984) and [[Kargil War|Kargil]] (1999).&lt;ref name="kashmir1" /&gt; Approximately 45.1% of the [[Kashmir region]] is [[Indian controlled Kashmir|controlled]] by India, which also claims the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir, including most of Jammu, the [[Kashmir Valley]], [[Ladakh]], and the [[Siachen Glacier|Siachen]].&lt;ref name="kashmir1" /&gt; The claim is contested by Pakistan, which [[Kashmir|controls]] approximately 38.2% of the [[Kashmir region]], an area known as the [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit–Baltistan]].&lt;ref name="kashmir1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sean Anderson |title=Historical dictionary of terrorism |year=2009 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-4101-7 |pages=347–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law enforcement ===
{{Main|Law enforcement in Pakistan|Pakistan Intelligence Community|National Intelligence Directorate (Pakistan)}}

The [[law enforcement in Pakistan]] is carried out by joint network of several federal and provincial police agencies. The [[Administrative units of Pakistan|four provinces]] and the [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] (ICT) each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction extending only to the relevant province or territory.&lt;ref name="ciafactbook" /&gt; At the federal level, there are a number of civilian [[Pakistan Intelligence Community|intelligence agencies]] with nationwide jurisdictions including the [[Federal Investigation Agency]] (FIA), [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), and the [[National Highways and Motorway Police|Motorway Patrol]], as well as several [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|paramilitary forces]] such as the [[National Guard of Pakistan|National Guards]] ([[Northern Areas of Pakistan|Northern Areas]]), the [[Pakistan Rangers|Rangers]] (Punjab and Sindh), and the [[Frontier Corps]] (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan).

The most senior officers of all the civilian police forces also form part of the [[Police Service of Pakistan|Police Service]], which is a component of the [[Central Superior Services of Pakistan|civil service]] of Pakistan. Namely, there is four provincial [[Police Service of Pakistan|police service]] including the [[Punjab Police (Pakistan)|Punjab Police]], [[Sindh Police]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police]], and the [[Balochistan Police]]; all headed by the appointed senior [[Inspector general|Inspector-Generals]]. The ICT has its own police component, the [[Capital Territory Police|Capital Police]], to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] in the capital. The [[Crime Investigation Department (Pakistan)|CID]] bureaus are the [[crime investigation]] unit and form a vital part in each provincial [[Police Service of Pakistan|police service]].

The [[law enforcement in Pakistan]] also has a [[National Highways &amp; Motorway Police|Motorway Patrol]] which is responsible for enforcement of traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on Pakistan's inter-provincial [[Motorways of Pakistan|motorway network]]. In each of provincial [[Police Service of Pakistan|Police Service]], it also maintains a respective [[Elite Police]] units led by the [[National Counter Terrorism Authority|NACTA]]—a counter-terrorism police unit as well as providing VIP escorts. In the Punjab and Sindh, the [[Pakistan Rangers]] are an internal security force with the prime objective to provide and maintain security in war zones and areas of conflict as well as maintaining law and order which includes providing assistance to the police.&lt;ref name="npb1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npb.gov.pk/partners/ |title=Our Partners |publisher=National Police Bureau, Government of Pakistan|access-date=1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118155449/http://www.npb.gov.pk/partners/ |archive-date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frontier Corps]] serves the similar purpose in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], and the Balochistan.&lt;ref name="npb1" /&gt;

The structure of the Pakistani economy has changed from [[Agriculture in Pakistan|a mainly agricultural]] to a strong service base. Agriculture {{As of|2015|lc=y}} accounts for only 20.9% of the GDP.&lt;ref name="DSEC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pakistan Economic Survey 2014–15 |url=http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_15/Highlights.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Finance|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, according to the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat in 2005, more than all of Africa (20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of South America (24,557,784 metric tons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbp.org.pk/departments/stats/PakEconomy_HandBook/Chap-1.2.pdf |title=Sectoral Share in Gross Domestic Product |year=2010 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Statistics |page=10|access-date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on this sector. It accounts for 43.5% of employed labour force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.&lt;ref name="DSEC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/agriculture-statistics |title=Agriculture Statistics {{!}} Pakistan Bureau of Statistics|website=www.pbs.gov.pk|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of the country's manufactured exports is dependent on raw materials such as cotton and hides that are part of the agriculture sector, while supply shortages and market disruptions in farm products do push up inflationary pressures. The country is also the fifth-largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of 14&amp;nbsp;million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7&amp;nbsp;million bales in the early 1950s; is self-sufficient in sugarcane; and is the fourth-largest producer in the world of milk. Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the [[Green Revolution]] that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation. While the tube wells raised crop yields by 50 percent, the High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice led to a 50–60 percent higher yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NnB-wi4YIZYJ:https://ishrathusain.iba.edu.pk/speeches/New/AgricultureSector_Issues_n_Prospects.docx+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au |title=AGRICULTURE SECTOR: ISSUES AND PROSPECTS|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_10/03_Manufacturing.pdf |title=Manufacturing in Pakistan |publisher=Government of Pakistan|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry ===

{{See also|Textile industry in Pakistan}}
[[File:Tv Assembly Line 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Television assembly factory in [[Lahore]]. Pakistan's industrial sector accounts for about 20.3% of the GDP, and is dominated by [[small and medium-sized enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/industry |title=Industry {{!}} Pakistan Bureau of Statistics|website=www.pbs.gov.pk|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Industry is the second-largest sector of the economy, accounting for 19.74% of gross domestic product (GDP), and 24 percent of total employment. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM), at 12.2% of GDP, dominates the overall sector, accounting for 66% of the sectoral share, followed by small-scale manufacturing, which accounts for 4.9% of total GDP. Pakistan's cement industry is also fast growing mainly because of demand from [[Afghanistan]] and from the domestic real estate sector. In 2013 Pakistan exported 7,708,557 [[metric tons]] of cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apcma.com/data_export.html |title=All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association Export Data |publisher=Apcma.com|access-date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan has an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons of cement and 42,636,428 metric tons of clinker. In 2012 and 2013, the cement industry in Pakistan became the most profitable sector of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bhutta |first=Zafar |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/552042/cant-get-enough-soaring-profits-not-enough-for-cement-industry/ |title=Can't get enough: Soaring profits not enough for cement industry |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=21 May 2013|access-date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Textile industry in Pakistan|textile industry]] has a pivotal position in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. In Asia, Pakistan is the eighth-largest exporter of textile products, contributing 9.5% to the GDP and providing employment to around 15&amp;nbsp;million people (some 30% of the 49&amp;nbsp;million people in the workforce). Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5% to the global spinning capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Statistics on textile industry in Pakistan |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/522292/statistics-on-textile-industry-in-pakistan/|access-date=4 March 2017 |work=[[Express Tribune]] |date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527&amp;nbsp;billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike the US, where mostly value-added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07bn of all UK textile imports, 12.4% or $4.61bn of total Chinese textile imports, 3.0% of all US textile imports ($2,980&amp;nbsp;million), 1.6% of total German textile imports ($880&amp;nbsp;million) and 0.7% of total Indian textile imports ($888&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baig |first=Khurram |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/522293/anatomy-of-an-indispensable-sector-why-the-pakistan-textile-industry-cannot-die/ |title=Why the Pakistan textile industry cannot die |work=[[Express Tribune]] |date=18 March 2013|access-date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The services sector makes up 58.8% of GDP&lt;ref name="DSEC" /&gt; and has emerged as the main driver of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/483436/the-unparalleled-growth-of-the-services-sector/ |title=The unparalleled growth of the services sector |work=[[Express Tribune]]|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani society like other developing countries is a consumption oriented society, having a high marginal propensity to consume. The growth rate of services sector is higher than the growth rate of agriculture and industrial sector. Services sector accounts for 54 percent of GDP in 2014 and little over one-third of total employment. Services sector has strong linkages with other sectors of economy; it provides essential inputs to agriculture sector and manufacturing sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pide.org.pk/pdf/Working%20Paper/WorkingPaper-79.pdf |title=Contribution of Services Sector in the Economy of Pakistan |access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's I.T sector is regarded as among the fastest growing sector's in Pakistan.

=== Urbanisation ===
{{Main|Urbanisation in Pakistan}}
[[File:Kalma Underpass1.jpg|[[Kalma Underpass]], [[Lahore]]|thumb]]
Since [[Independence of Pakistan|achieving independence]] as a result of the [[partition of India]], the [[Urbanisation in Pakistan|urbanisation]] has increased exponentially, with several different causes. The majority of the population in the south resides along the [[Indus River]], with [[Karachi]] the most populous commercial city.&lt;ref name="The Urban Frontier—Karachi" /&gt; In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Islamabad]], [[Sargodha]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Jhelum]], [[Sheikhupura]], [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], [[Mardan]], and [[Peshawar]]. During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.&lt;ref name="Jason Burke" /&gt; [[Immigration to Pakistan|Immigration]], from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the [[1998 Pakistan Census|1998 national census]] highlighted the significance of the [[partition of India]] in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=David |title=The Elgar Companion to Development Studies |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-1-84376-475-5 |page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During and after the independence period, [[Muhajir people|Urdu speaking Muslims]] from India migrated in large numbers to Pakistan, especially to the port city of [[Karachi]], which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan. [[Immigration to Pakistan|Migration from other countries]], mainly from those nearby, has further accelerated the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities. Inevitably, the rapid urbanisation caused by these large population movements has also created new political and socio-economic challenges. In addition to immigration, economic trends such as the green revolution and political developments, among a host of other factors, are also important causes of urbanisation.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; {{Largest cities of Pakistan}}

The population of Pakistan follow different religions. Most of Pakistanis are [[Muslim]]s (96.47%) followed by [[Hindu]]s (2.14%) and [[Christians]] (1.27%). There are also people in Pakistan who follow other religions, such as [[Sikhism in Pakistan|Sikhism]], [[Buddhism in Pakistan|Buddhism]], [[Jainism in Pakistan|Jainism]] and the minority of [[Parsi]] (who follow [[Zoroastrianism]]). The [[Kalash people]] maintain a unique identity and religion within Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan's Forgotten Pagans Get Their Due |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/28439107.html |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism is mostly associated with [[Sindhis]], and Pakistan hosts major events such as the [[Hinglaj_Mata_mandir#Annual_pilgrimage_(Hinglaj_Yatra_or_Theerth_Yatra)|Hinglaj Yatra]] pilgrimage. Hindu temples may be found [[Hinduism in Sindh Province|throughout Sindh]], where the dharma features prominently. Many Hindus in Pakistan complain about the prospect of religious violence against them and being treated like second-class citizens, and many have emigrated to India or further abroad.&lt;ref name="bbc200703022"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6367773.stm |title=Hindus feel the heat in Pakistan |last=Sohail |first=Riaz |date=2 March 2007 |work=BBC News |quote=But many Hindu families who stayed in Pakistan after partition have already lost faith and migrated to India.|access-date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some Pakistanis also do not profess any faith (such as [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]) in Pakistan. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population. [[Secularism]] and criticism of over-religiosity is not uncommon in well-educated civil society, although in general Pakistan is a highly religious society, and the [[irreligion|irreligious]] generally hide their beliefs due to fear of persecution.

The [[Ahmadiyya in Pakistan|Ahmadis]], a small minority representing 0.22–2% of Pakistan's population,&lt;ref&gt;The 1998 Pakistani census states that there are 291,000 (0.22%) Ahmadis in Pakistan. However, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be somewhere between 2 million and 5 million Ahmadis. However, the 4 million figure is the most quoted figure and is approximately 2.2% of the country. See:

[[Sufism]], a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large following among the Sunni Muslims in Pakistan, at both the academic and popular levels. Popular Sufi culture is centered around gatherings and celebrations at the shrines of saints and annual festivals that feature Sufi music and dance. Two Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are [[Ali Hajweri]] in [[Lahore]] (c.&amp;nbsp;12th century)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WO-5e-HSdOoC&amp;pg=PA47 |title=Producing Islamic Knowledge: Transmission and Dissemination in Western Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-415-35592-6 |page=47 |chapter=An emerging European Islam: The case of the Minhaj ul Quran in the Netherlands |author=Amer Morgahi|access-date=30 July 2013 |editor=Martin van Bruinessen, Stefano Allievi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shahbaz Qalander]] in [[Sehwan]], Sindh (c.&amp;nbsp;12th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1136858 |title=Sehwan: The undisputed throne of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar |author=Farooq Soomro |website=dawn.com|access-date=13 January 2016|date=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two levels of [[Sufism]] in Pakistan. The first is the 'populist' Sufism of the rural population. This level of Sufism involves belief in intercession through saints, veneration of their shrines, and forming bonds (Mureed) with a ''pir'' (saint). Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with [[Pir (Sufism)|''pirs'']] and seek their intercession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0616 |title=Pakistan |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |quote=Sūfī Islam in Pakistan is represented at two levels. The first is the populist Sufism of the rural masses, associated with unorthodox religious rituals and practices, belief in the intercessory powers of saints, pilgrimage and veneration at their shrines, and a binding spiritual relationship between the shaykh or pir (master) and murīd (disciple). Many Muslims in rural areas of Pakistan, where orthodox Islam has yet to penetrate effectively, identify themselves with some pir, living or dead, and seek his intercession for the solution of their worldly problems and for salvation in the hereafter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second level of Sufism in Pakistan is 'intellectual Sufism', which is growing among the urban and educated population. They are influenced by the writings of Sufis such as the medieval theologian [[al-Ghazali]], the Sufi reformer [[Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi|Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi]], and [[Shah Wali Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0616 |title=Pakistan |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |quote=The other strain is that of scholastic or intellectual Sufism, a recent phenomenon based in urban areas and becoming increasingly popular in educated circles. Influenced by the writings of the medieval theologian al-Ghazālī (d.&amp;nbsp;1111), the Sūfī reformer Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindī (d.&amp;nbsp;1624), and Shāh Walī Allāh (d.&amp;nbsp;1762), and by the spiritual experiences of the masters of the Suhrawardī and Naqshbandī orders, these modern Sūfīs are rearticulating Islamic metaphysics as an answer to Western materialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticise Sufism's popular character, which in their view does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of [[Muhammad]] and his companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html |title=Sufism Under Attack in Pakistan |newspaper=The New York Times |format=video |access-date=21 May 2012 |author=Produced by Charlotte Buchen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528051803/http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html |archive-date=28 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pakistani fashion|fashion industry]] has flourished in the changing environment of the fashion world. Since Pakistan came into being, its fashion has evolved in different phases and developed a unique identity. Today, Pakistani fashion is a combination of traditional and modern dress and has become a mark of Pakistani culture. Despite modern trends, regional and traditional forms of dress have developed their own significance as a symbol of native tradition. This regional fashion continues to evolve into both more modern and purer forms. The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in [[Lahore]] organizes [[PFDC Sunsilk Fashion Week|PFDC Fashion Week]] and the Fashion Pakistan Council based in [[Karachi]] organizes [[Fashion Pakistan Week]].

The [[Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis]] was established in 2008 to deal exclusively with all matters of overseas Pakistanis such as attending to their needs and problems, developing projects for their welfare, and working for resolution of their problems and issues. Overseas Pakistanis are the second-largest source of foreign exchange remittances to Pakistan after exports. Over the last several years, home remittances have maintained a steadily rising trend, with a more than 100% increase from US$8.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2009–10 to US$19.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2015–16.&lt;ref name="remit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank1" /&gt;

The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the [[Ministry of Labour (Pakistan)|Ministry of Labour]] (MoL). It has since recognised the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy. Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is making efforts to improve the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad. The division aims to provide better services through improved facilities at airports, and suitable schemes for housing, education, and health care. It also facilitates the reintegration into society of returning overseas Pakistanis. Notable members of the Pakistani diaspora include the [[London Mayor]] [[Sadiq Khan]], the UK cabinet member [[Sajid Javid]], the former [[UK Conservative Party]] chair [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Warsi]], the singers [[Zayn Malik]] and [[Nadia Ali (singer)|Nadia Ali]], [[MIT]] physics Professor [[Nergis Mavalvala|Dr. Nergis Mavalvala]], the actors [[Riz Ahmed]] and [[Kumail Nanjiani]], the businessmen [[Shahid Khan]] and [[Sir Anwar Pervez]], Boston University professors [[Adil Najam]] and [[Hamid Nawab]], [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]] professor [[Muhammad Suhail Zubairy]], [[Yale]] professor [[Sara Suleri]], [[UC San Diego]] professor [[Farooq Azam]] and the historian [[Ayesha Jalal]].

Four periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: [[History of Pakistan#Early history|pre-Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Muslim period|Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Colonial era|colonial]], and [[History of Pakistan#Independence|post-colonial]]. With the beginning of the [[Indus civilization]] around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vidja Dehejia |title=South Asian Art and Culture |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sasa/hd_sasa.htm |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Indus Valley And The Genesis Of South Asian Civilization |url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm |website=History World International |access-date=6 February 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68HwtFCFs?url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm |archive-date=9 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]], Harappa, and [[Kot Diji]] are among the pre-Islamic settlements that are now tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="mountains" /&gt; The rise of [[Buddhism]] and the influence of [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|Greek]] civilisation led to the development of a [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] style,&lt;ref&gt;Sachindra Kumar Maity.

The high point of this era was the [[Gandhara#Art|Gandhara style]]. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery [[Takht Bhai|Takht-i-Bahi]] in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UNESCO Advisory Body Evaluation of Takht Bhai |publisher=International Council on Monuments and Sites |pages=1–2 |url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/140.pdf |date=29 December 1979|access-date=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless [[Islamic architecture]]. The most important [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]]-style building still standing is the [[Rukn-e-Alam|tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam]] in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as the occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among them are the [[Badshahi Mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort|fortress of Lahore]] with the famous [[Alamgiri Gate]], the colourful, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]]-style [[Wazir Khan Mosque]],&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ross Valentine.

In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures such as the [[Faisal Mosque]], the [[Minar-e-Pakistan]], and the [[Mazar-e-Quaid]]. Several examples of architectural infrastructure demonstrating the influence of [[Architecture of the United Kingdom|British design]] can be found in [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamil Khan Mumtaz |title=Architecture in Pakistan |year=1985 |publisher=Concept Media Pte Ltd |isbn=978-9971-84-141-6 |pages=32, 51, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
