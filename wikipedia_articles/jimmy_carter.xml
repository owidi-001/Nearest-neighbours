{{Jimmy Carter series}}

'''James Earl Carter Jr.''' (born October 1, 1924) is an American philanthropist, former politician and businessman who served as the 39th [[president of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as a [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia State Senator]] from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th [[List of governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]] from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained engaged in political and social projects as a private citizen. In 2002, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in co-founding [[The Carter Center]].

Raised in [[Plains, Georgia]], Carter graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and joined the [[United States Navy]], where he served on [[submarine]]s. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little because of his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carter family's peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and support the growing [[civil rights movement]]. He became an activist within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the [[Georgia State Senate]], and in [[1970 Georgia gubernatorial election|1970]], he was elected as [[Governor of Georgia]], defeating former Governor [[Carl Sanders]] in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating [[affirmative action]] for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a [[Dark horse|dark-horse candidate]] who was little known outside of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] at the start of the campaign, Carter won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic presidential nomination]]. In the [[1976 United States presidential election|general election]], Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]].

On his second day in office, Carter [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]] all the Vietnam War [[Draft evasion|draft evaders]] by issuing [[Proclamation 4483]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Today in History for January 21 {{!}} President Carter pardons draft dodgers – YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOcKYJdF_eo |access-date=January 14, 2021 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], were established. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and the return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to [[Panama]]. On the economic front, he confronted [[stagflation]], a persistent combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the [[Cold War]] when he ended [[détente]], imposed [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|a grain embargo against the Soviets]], enunciated the [[Carter Doctrine]], and led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. Carter lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|general election]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in an electoral landslide. He is the only president in American history to serve a full term of office and never appoint a justice to the Supreme Court. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Polls of historians and political scientists]] usually rank Carter as a below-average president. Carter's activities since leaving the presidency have been viewed more favorably than his presidency itself.

In 1982, Carter established The Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the charity [[Habitat for Humanity]]. He has written [[Bibliography of Jimmy Carter|over 30 books]], ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs such as the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. At {{age|1924|10|1}} years old and with a {{age|1981|1|20}}-year-long retirement, he is both the oldest living president and the one with [[Post-presidency of Jimmy Carter|the longest post-presidency]]. He is also the [[List of oldest living state leaders|sixth-oldest living former world leader]].

== Early life ==
[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|left|Carter (around age 13) with his dog, Bozo, in 1937]]
James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium (now the [[Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]], a hospital where his mother was employed as a registered nurse. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.&lt;ref name="bourne-11-32" /&gt; He was the eldest son of [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian]] ({{nee|Gordy}}) and [[James Earl Carter Sr.]] Carter is a descendant of [[English people|English]] immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in [[Virginia]] in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Carter is also a descendant of [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]], an ancestor of [[Cornell University]]'s founder, and is distantly related to [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Bill Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html |title=Ancestry of Sen. John Kerry |website=www.wargs.com |access-date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:17 02 111 carter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Carter family store (part of [[Jimmy Carter National Historic Site|Carter's Boyhood Farm]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]]]]
Plains was a [[boomtown]] of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. Carter's father was a successful local businessman, who ran a [[general store]], and was an investor in farmland.&lt;ref name="bourne-114"&gt;Bourne, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="bourne-114"&gt;Bourne, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved several times during Carter Jr.'s infancy.&lt;ref name="bourne-11-32"&gt;Bourne, pp. 11–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby [[Archery, Georgia|Archery]], which was almost entirely populated by impoverished [[African American]] families. They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro-[[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.&lt;ref name="bourne-11-32" /&gt;

=== Education ===
Carter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Jimmy was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a [[hot rod]]. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian.&lt;ref name="bourne-33-43"&gt;Bourne, pp. 33–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.&lt;ref name="bourne-33-43" /&gt;

== Naval career ==
Carter had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby Americus, Georgia. The following year, he transferred to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, and he earned admission to the Naval Academy in 1943. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth. The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 44–55.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[sprint football]] player for the [[Navy Midshipmen]].&lt;ref name="hingston20160424"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hingston, Sandy |url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/04/24/princeton-sprint-football-team/ |title=Why This Princeton Football Team Won't Be Suiting Up Next Season |work=Philadelphia |date=April 24, 2016 |access-date=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Alter, ''His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life'' (2020) p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his deployments in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].&lt;ref name="zelizer-11"&gt;Zelizer, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard {{USS|Pomfret|SS-391|6}}. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenant junior grade]] in 1949. In 1951 he became attached to the diesel/electric USS ''K-1'', (a.k.a. {{USS|Barracuda|SSK-1|6}}), qualified for command, and served in several duties including Executive Officer.&lt;ref name="naval service"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jimmy Carter's Naval Service |url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/jec/jcnavy.phtml |website=Jimmy Carter Presidential Library &amp; Museum |access-date=November 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116012607/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/jec/jcnavy.phtml |archive-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Carter began an association with the Navy's fledgling [[nuclear submarine]] program, then led by Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]]. Rickover's demands on his men and machines were legendary, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover was the greatest influence on his life.&lt;ref name="bourne-72"&gt;Bourne, pp. 72–77.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] in Washington, D.C. for three month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York. On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at [[Atomic Energy of Canada]]'s [[Chalk River Laboratories]] caused a partial meltdown resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor building's basement. This left the reactor's core ruined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nN9FAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chalk+river+nuclear+accident+1952 |title=Great Events from History II: 1945–1966 |last=Frank |first=Northen Magill |year=1995 |page=554 |isbn=978-0-89356-753-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YElaxt6fv4C&amp;q=jimmy+carter+chalk+river&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Memoirs of a Hayseed Physicist |first=Peter |last=Martel |year=2008 |page=64 |isbn=978-1-60693-341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for a few minutes at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease development of a [[neutron bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawariverkeeper.ca/news/when_jimmy_carter_faced_radioactivity_head_on/ |first=Arthur |last=Milnes |title=When Jimmy Carter faced radioactivity head-on |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=January 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217161647/http://ottawariverkeeper.ca/news/when_jimmy_carter_faced_radioactivity_head_on |archive-date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school, a six-month non-credit course covering nuclear power plant operation at [[Union College]] in Schenectady.&lt;ref name="zelizer-11" /&gt; His intent was to eventually work aboard {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}, which was planned to be the second U.S. nuclear submarine.  However, he never had the opportunity to serve aboard a nuclear submarine. Carter's father died two months before construction of ''Seawolf'' began, and Carter sought and obtained a release from active duty to enable him to take over the family peanut business. Based on that limited training, in later years Carter would nonetheless refer to himself as a "nuclear physicist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2019/03/the-real-jimmy-carter/ |title=The Real Jimmy Carter |publisher=[[Harper's Magazine]] |author=[[Steven Brill (journalist)|Steven Brill]] |date=March 1976 |access-date=September 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/06/archives/the-wellplanned-enigma-of-jimmy-carter-despite-his-attempts-to.html|title=The well-planned enigma of Jimmy Carter|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=James T. Wooten|date=June 6, 1976|access-date=September 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult. Settling after moving so much, Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life. Returning to small-town life in Plains seemed "a monumental step backward," she said later. On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father's. Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 77–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the inactive [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] until 1961, and left the service with the rank of [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.usni.org/2015/03/09/from-ensign-to-commander-in-chief-a-look-at-the-presidents-who-served-in-the-u-s-navy-reserve |title=From Ensign to Commander-in-Chief: A Look at the Presidents Who Served in the U.S. Navy Reserve |last=Eckstein |first=Megan |date=March 9, 2015 |website=USNI News |publisher=United States Navy Institute |location=Annapolis, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; His awards included the [[American Campaign Medal]], [[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]], [[China Service Medal]], and [[National Defense Service Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1976 |title=Ocean Science News |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5cTAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22american+campaign+medal%22 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Nautilus Press |page=109 |quote=The Naval Record of James Earl Carter Jr.: Medals and awards: American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and Natl.

== Farming ==
Earl Carter died a relatively wealthy man, having recently been elected to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]]. However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in [[public housing]] in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in subsidized housing before he took office. Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult because his first-year harvest failed due to a drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books. Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 83–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early political career (1963–1971) ==

=== Georgia state senator (1963–1967) ===
Racial tension was inflamed in Plains by the 1954 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] anti-segregation ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gherman |first=Beverly |date=2004 |title=Jimmy Carter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U51zgi7xAgkC&amp;pg=PA40 |location=Minneapolis, MN |publisher=Lerner Publishers |page=40 |isbn=978-0-8225-0816-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integration—at one point, the local [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]] boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join them—but he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies.

Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. The initial results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the Democratic Party chairman in [[Quitman County, Georgia|Quitman County]], with the aid of the Quitman County sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Jimmy |date=1992 |title=Turning Point: A Candidate, a State, and a Nation Come of Age |url=https://archive.org/details/turningpointcand00cart_0/page/83 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Three Rivers Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/turningpointcand00cart_0/page/83 83–87] |isbn=978-0-8129-2299-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 108–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[civil rights movement]] was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch [[John F. Kennedy]] supporters. Beginning in 1962, the town of Americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyman-Barner |first1=Kirk |last2=Lyman-Barner |first2=Cori |date=2014 |title=Roots in the Cotton Patch: The Clarence Jordan Symposium 2012 |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYUNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 |location=Eugene, OR |publisher=Cascade Books |page=136 |isbn=978-1-62032-985-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing similar unrest throughout the country. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. He did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against [[literacy tests]] and against a change to the Georgia Constitution which, he felt, implied a compulsion to practice religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 132–140.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy's assassination]], Carter was informed by a customer of his peanut business of the killing, prompting Carter to remove himself from work and sit alone. Carter later called the assassination "the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died."&lt;ref name="JFK Library 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/quUBiS-mbUqmLVi93pcMgw.aspx |title=A Conversation with Jimmy Carter |date=November 20, 2014 |publisher=John F.

Carter was a diligent legislator who took speed-reading courses to keep up with the workload. Within two years, his connections landed him on the state Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryan, Jr. |first1=Bernard |title=Jimmy Carter: U.S. President and Humanitarian |date=2006 |publisher=Ferguson |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8160-5903-9 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOLy2AzWhacC |access-date=March 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Bo Callaway]] was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in November 1964, Carter immediately began planning to unseat him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state; Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, [[Georgia Southwestern College]], but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]. Carter saw Callaway, a Democrat who had recently switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 132–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was re-elected in 1964 to serve a second two-year term.&lt;ref name="sixty-five"&gt;{{cite web |title=Members Of The General Assembly Of Georgia – Term 1965–1966 |publisher=State of Georgia |url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/cgi-bin/govdimag.cgi?path=dbs/1965/ga/s700/_ps1/g4/1965_h66/sess_p1_sno_p1.con/&amp;user=galileo&amp;sessionid=637f8586-1547653717-5036&amp;serverid=DU&amp;instcode=afpl&amp;return=ggpd%3fuserid%3dgalileo%26dbs%3dggpd%26action%3dretrieve%26recno%3d70%26numrecs%3d100%26__rtype%3drecno%26key%3dy-ga-bs700-b-ps1-bg4-b1965-h66-bsess-p1-sno-p1 |date=February 1965 |access-date=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time in the State Senate, he chaired its Education Committee; he also sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term. Before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. The last day of the term, he announced his run for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 145–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1966 and 1970 campaigns for governor ===
{{see also|1966 Georgia gubernatorial election|1970 Georgia gubernatorial election}}
The race for [[Georgia's 3rd congressional district]] in 1966 was shaken up in mid-May when the incumbent, Bo Callaway, dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia instead. Callaway had just switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1964, and was a very strong candidate, despite being the first Republican to run for Governor of Georgia since 1876. State Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Carter decided to run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran against the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative segregationist [[Lester Maddox]]. In a press conference he described his ideology as "Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road.&amp;nbsp;... I believe I am a more complicated person than that."&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 149–153.&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a [[two-round system|runoff election]] with Maddox. Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall for the Democratic Party gubernatorial nomination. In the general election, Callaway went on to win a plurality of the vote, but short of a 50 percent majority, state rules empowered the Georgia House of Representatives, which had a Democratic Party majority, to elect Maddox as governor.&lt;ref name="bourne-153" /&gt; The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to wrest the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome.&lt;ref name="bourne-153"&gt;Bourne, pp. 153–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], he declared himself [[Born again]], a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child [[Amy Carter|Amy]] was born during this time, on October 19, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp. 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GACountiesGovernor1970.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A map of Georgia counties, almost all of which are medium to dark blue with a small handful of red counties in the north|Results of the 1970 gubernatorial election in Georgia, with blue counties supporting Carter and red ones voting for [[Hal Suit]]: the relative darkness of the shade shows greater support for a candidate.]]

Governor Maddox was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term as governor, and thus the liberal former governor, [[Carl Sanders]], became Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than before. He positioned himself as a [[populism|populist]], quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him "Cufflinks Carl") and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.&lt;ref name="bourne-180"&gt;Bourne, pp. 180–199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hayward-46"&gt;Hayward, pp. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the "Wallace vote," after the prominent segregationist [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools, depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.&lt;ref name="bourne-180" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hayward-46" /&gt;

That September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The subsequent campaign grew even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's campaign criticized Sanders for supporting [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote—winning 7 percent of the black vote—and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican [[Hal Suit]], a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter changed his tone, and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. [[Leroy Johnson (Georgia politician)|Leroy Johnson]], a black state Senator, voiced his support for Carter, saying, "I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign.&amp;nbsp;... I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist."&lt;ref name="bourne-180" /&gt;

== Governor of Georgia (1971–1975) ==
[[File:Jimmy Carter official portrait as Governor.jpg|thumb|upright|Carter's official portrait as Governor of Georgia]]
Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. He declared in his inaugural speech that "the time of racial discrimination is over.&amp;nbsp;... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/inaugural_address.pdf |title=Inaugural Address |access-date=November 27, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201224225/https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/inaugural_address.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd was reportedly shocked by this message, contrasting starkly with Georgia's political culture and particularly Carter's campaign. The many segregationists who had supported Carter during the race felt betrayed. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ran a story on the [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]] "[[New South]]" governors elected that year in a May 1971 issue, featuring a cover illustration of Carter.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp. 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19710531,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Gov.

[[Lester Maddox]], Carter's predecessor as governor, became [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia|lieutenant governor]]. Carter had endorsed Maddox, although the two did not campaign as a [[ticket (election)|ticket]]. The two found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Russell Jr.]], then [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]], died in office during Carter's second week in office; the newly inaugurated governor appointed [[David H.

Carter was reluctant to engage in back-slapping and political favors, and the legislature found him frustrating to work with.&lt;ref name="bourne-204" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He looked to aggressively expand the governor's authority while reducing the complexity of the state government. Therefore, he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it. He implemented [[zero-based budgeting]] within state departments and added a Judicial Selection Commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor.&lt;ref name="bourne-204"&gt;Bourne, pp. 204–212.&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization plan was submitted in January 1972, but had a cool reception in the legislature. But after two weeks of negotiations, it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 214–220.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 22—a fact he would emphasize in his presidential run—although it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Roger A. |title=The Wayward Welfare State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNF5kqmKi78C&amp;pg=PA5 |publisher=Hoover Press |isbn=978-0-8179-7493-0 |page=5 |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 3, 1971, televised appearance, Carter was asked if he was in favor of a requirement that candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Georgia would have to run on the same ticket. He replied, "I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate." Carter later clarified he would not introduce an amendment to put such a restriction in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19710405&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Maddox dares Carter to try cutting post |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=April 5, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in [[Columbus, Georgia]], Carter stated his intent to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council that would work toward solving issues within the state ahead of any potential violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19710714&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter aims to create human relations panel |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=July 8, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 13, 1971, news conference, Carter announced his ordering of department heads to reduce spending for the aid of preventing a $57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be impacted and estimating that 5% more than revenue being taken in by the government would be lost if state departments continued full using allocated funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19710714&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Gov. Carter orders cuts in Georgia spending |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=July 14, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1972, Carter requested the state legislature provide funding for an Early Childhood Development Program along with prison reform programs and 48 million in pay taxes for nearly all state employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19720113&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Two budget proposals offered by Gov. Carter to legislature |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=January 13, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1972, Carter stated a possible usage of a special session of the General Assembly could take place in the event that the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19720302&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Reappointment rejection could bring session |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=March 2, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, Carter issued the call for a special session for consideration of advisement for the usage of a three person judge federal panel for performance on four judicial reform measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19720421&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Maddox is opposed to special session |date=April 21, 1972 |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1972, Carter traveled to Latin and South America for a potential trade deal with Georgia. Carter stated that he had met with [[President of Brazil]] [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici]] and had been compared by some to the late President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19720414&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter given royal treatment on Latin journey |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=April 14, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights were a heartfelt priority for Carter. He expanded the number of black state employees, judges, and board members. He hired Rita Jackson Samuels, a black woman, to advise him on potential appointments.&lt;ref name="bourne-212" /&gt; He placed portraits of Martin Luther King Jr. and two other prominent black Georgians in the capitol building, even as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] picketed the unveiling ceremony.&lt;ref name="bourne-250" /&gt; Still, Carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable. During a televised joint appearance with [[Governor of Florida]] [[Reubin Askew]] on January 31, 1973, Carter stated he favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19730201&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Governors disagree on school busing |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=February 1, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference,&lt;ref name="bourne-212"&gt;Bourne, pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; which Carter also hosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19711107&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Southern governors meeting in Atlanta |date=November 7, 1971 |publisher=-Rome News-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] threw out Georgia's [[death penalty in the United States|death penalty]] statute in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' (1972), Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute that addressed the court's objections, thus re-introducing the practice in the state. Carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, "I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/11/jimmy-carter-supreme-court-death-penalty |title=Jimmy Carter calls for fresh moratorium on death penalty |author=Pilkington, Ed |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter pushed reforms through the legislature that provided equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia, set up community centers for mentally handicapped children, and increased educational programs for convicts. He took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit, rather than political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbook.com/content-spotlight/item/1156-lives-and-times-of-american-presidents-1961-present/1156-lives-and-times-of-american-presidents-1961-present?start=5 |title=Carter, Jimmy |publisher=World Book Student |author=Hugh S.

In one of his more controversial decisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25889670/ns/us_news-environment/t/jimmy-carter-battles-plan-dams-again/ |title=Jimmy Carter battles plan for dams – again |agency=Associated Press |date=July 28, 2008 |publisher=NBCNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]]. After surveying the river and the literature himself, he argued that the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was underestimating both the project's cost and its impact on the region. The veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide.&lt;ref name="bourne-250"&gt;Bourne, pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lieutenant [[William Calley]] was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the [[My Lai Massacre]] in [[South Vietnam]], a politically polarizing issue, Carter avoided paying direct tribute to Calley. He instead instituted "American Fighting Man's Day" and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 213–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National ambition ===
Under Georgia's constitution, Carter was ineligible to run for re-election. Looking toward a potential presidential run, Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]], where the liberal U.S. Senator [[George McGovern]] was the likely presidential nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative, anti-McGovern voters, so that the convention would consider him for McGovern's running mate on a compromise ticket. He endorsed Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry "Scoop" Jackson]], in part to distance himself from George Wallace. Carter was still fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 Democratic ticket]] was McGovern and Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 221–230.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Eagleton was later replaced on the ticket by [[Sargent Shriver]].|group=note}} On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] to discuss preventing the Democratic Party from losing in a landslide during the November elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19720804&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter, Wallace hold election conference |date=August 4, 1972 |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After McGovern's loss in November 1972, Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff. He had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] to boost his visibility. On [[David Rockefeller]]'s endorsement he was named to the [[Trilateral Commission]] in April 1973. The following year he was named chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, pp. 237–250.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he appeared on the game show ''[[What's My Line]]'', where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation. None recognized him and it took several rounds of question-and-answer before movie critic [[Gene Shalit]] correctly guessed he was a governor.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1973, Carter warned the Democratic Party against politicizing the [[Watergate scandal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19730513&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter cautions Democrats to play it cool on Watergate |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=May 13, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; the occurrence of which he attributed to President [[Richard Nixon]] exercising isolation from Americans and secrecy in his decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19730514&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter off on European tour |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |date=May 14, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barred by the [[Constitution of the State of Georgia|Georgia State Constitution]] from running for a second term as governor, Carter announced his candidacy for [[President of the United States]] on December 12, 1974, at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-announcing-candidacy-for-the-democratic-presidential-nomination-the-national-press |title=Address Announcing Candidacy for the Democratic Presidential Nomination at the National Press Club in Washington, DC |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=dXBh7-90p_YC&amp;dat=19741213&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter a candidate for the presidency |publisher=Lodi News-Sentinel |date=December 13, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries, he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians; his [[name recognition]] was two percent. As late as January 26, 1976{{dubious|date=January 2020}}, Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters, according to a [[Gallup poll]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Yet "by mid-March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also led President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] by a few percentage points," according to Shoup.&lt;ref&gt;Shoup (1980), ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond''&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Watergate scandal]] of President Nixon was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C., became an asset. He promoted government reorganization.

Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the [[Iowa caucus]]es and the [[New Hampshire primary]]. He used a two-prong strategy: in the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's [[George Wallace]], Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He had traveled over {{convert|50000|mi|km|abbr=off}}, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/carter/#transcript |title=Jimmy Carter |series=The American Experience |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |date=November 11, 2002 |access-date=June 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially dismissed as a regional candidate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |author-link1=David Broder |title=Early Evaluation Impossible on Presidential Candidates |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yMgwAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7214%2C2087680 |work=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=December 18, 1974 |page=16 |access-date=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter proved to be the Democrat with the most effective national strategy, and he clinched the nomination.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The national news media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'':

{{quote|What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls.

Carter was interviewed by [[Robert Scheer]] of ''[[Playboy]]'' for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election.

Carter's tenure was a time of [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|continuing inflation and recession]], as well as an [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]]. Among his first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] declaring unconditional [[amnesty]] for [[Vietnam War]]-era [[Draft evasion|draft evaders]], [[Proclamation 4483]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11967.html |title=Executive Orders |date=October 25, 2010 |website=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/vietnam/vietnam_1-21-77.html |title=Online NewsHour: Remembering Vietnam: Carter's Pardon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 1980, Carter signed [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32978 Law H.R. 5860 aka Public Law 96-185] known as ''The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979'', bailing out [[Chrysler]] Corporation with $3.5 billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.5|1980|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Burton I. |last2=Kaufman |first2=Scott |title=The Presidency of James Earl Carter, Jr |date=2006 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, Kansas |isbn=978-0-7006-1471-4 |page=183 |edition=2nd |chapter=A Growing Sense of Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington after being elected, meeting with Director of the Office of Management [[James Lynn]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] at the [[Blair House]], and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&amp;dat=19761122&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Carter in Washington, Meets Lynn, Rumsfield |newspaper=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Blade]] |location=Toledo, Ohio |date=November 22, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Carter conferred with congressional leaders, expressing that his meetings with cabinet members had been "very helpful" and saying Ford had requested he seek out his assistance if needing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&amp;dat=19761123&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=Ford Promises Carter Transition Cooperation |newspaper=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Blade]] |location=Toledo, Ohio |date=November 23, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Ford and Carter, however, would be relatively cold during the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eksterowicz |first1=Anthony J. |last2=Hastedt |first2=Glenn |title=Modern Presidential Transitions: Problems, Pitfalls, and Lessons for Success |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |date=1998 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=299–319 |jstor=27551861 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27551861 |access-date=18 May 2021 |issn=0360-4918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had "been long and divisive and arduous" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1008 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an April 11, 1978, news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise "in the nature of a disappointment" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: "I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1006 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carter energy legislation was approved by Congress after much deliberation and modification on October 15, 1978. The measure deregulated the sale of natural gas, dropped a longstanding pricing disparity between intra- and interstate gas, and created tax credits to encourage energy conservation and the use of non fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Burton Ira |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26359258 |title=The Presidency of James Earl Carter, Jr. |date=1993 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |isbn=0-7006-0572-X |location=Lawrence, Kan. |pages=108 |oclc=26359258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== EPA Love Canal Superfund ====
In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of [[Love Canal]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a [[toxic waste]] landfill. The [[Superfund]] law was created in response to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W.

This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more "Love Canals" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was "one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era".&lt;ref&gt;Paul E.

Carter refused to play by Washington's rules.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; He missed and never returned phone calls on his part.

I've been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual Members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where they've been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-104 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan. The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government by the vote and concluding "the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation." He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on "local or parochial interests" and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32325 |title=Standby Gasoline Rationing Plan Remarks on the House of Representatives Disapproval of the Plan |date=May 11, 1979 |publisher=American Presidency Project |first=Jimmy |last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks.

Carter's presidency had an economic history of two roughly equal periods, the first two years being a time of continuing recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession, which had left fixed investment at its lowest level since the 1970 recession and unemployment at 9%,&lt;ref name="stat 88"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1988-04.pdf |title=''1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States'' |publisher=Department of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last two years marked by double-digit inflation, coupled with very high interest rates,&lt;ref name="'70s 292"&gt;Frum, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; oil shortages, and slow economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/Is70sStyleStagflationComing.aspx |title=Is '70s-style stagflation returning? |author=Jim Jubak |publisher=MSN.com |date=April 1, 2008 |work=Jubak's Journal |access-date=October 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820042310/http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/Is70sStyleStagflationComing.aspx |archive-date=August 20, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The years of 1977 and 1978 saw the creation of millions of new jobs,&lt;ref name="Labor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/ |title=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as a result of the $30 billion economic stimulus legislation – like the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 – that he proposed and Congress passed, and real median household income growth by 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/09/us-median-household-income-up-in-2018-from-2017.html |title=Households by Median and Mean Income |publisher=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1979 energy crisis]] ended this period of growth, however, and as both inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation, and [[consumer confidence]] declined sharply.&lt;ref name="'70s 292" /&gt; The relatively loose [[monetary policy]] adopted by [[Federal Reserve Board]] Chairman [[G.

==== Deregulation ====
[[File:AirlineDeregulationAct.png|thumb|Carter signing the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], 1978]]

In 1977, Carter appointed [[Alfred E. Kahn]] to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading 'think tanks' in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contrived Competition: Regulation and Deregulation in America |last=Vietor |first=Richard H. K. |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-43679-4 |oclc=897163998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter signed the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to [[Airline deregulation|remove government control]] over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from [[commercial aviation]]. The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]]'s powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Applications in Business Aviation Management |isbn=978-1-60590-770-3 |last1=Cannon |first1=James R. |last2=Richey |first2=Franklin D. |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell [[malt]], [[hops]], and [[yeast]] to American [[Homebrewing|home brewers]] for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of [[Prohibition in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/beer-charts |title=Beer Charts of the Day |first=Tom |last=Philpott |publisher=Motherjones.com |date=August 17, 2011 |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft [[Microbrewery|microbrew]] culture in the United States, with 6,266 micro breweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brewersassociation.org/press-releases/small-and-independent-brewers-see-sustained-growth-in-2017/ |title=Number of Breweries |publisher=Brewers Association |date=March 27, 2018 |access-date=February 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====
Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to assist in fulfilling a campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In a February 28, 1978, address at the White House, Carter argued, "Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various Government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/elementary-and-secondary-education-remarks-announcing-the-administrations-proposals-the |title=Elementary and Secondary Education Remarks Announcing the Administration's Proposals to the Congress. |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.&lt;ref name="Dept of Ed outlined"&gt;{{cite news |title=Department of Education Outlined |agency=Associated Press |date=February 9, 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IkwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5661,1224804&amp;dq=department+of+education}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 1979, Carter signed the [[Department of Education Organization Act]] into law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/department-education-organization-act-statement-signing-s-210-into-law |title=Department of Education Organization Act Statement on Signing S. 210 Into Law. |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the [[United States Department of Education]].&lt;ref name="Dept of Ed created"&gt;{{cite news |title=Education Department Created |agency=United Press International |date=October 18, 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0sZUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1984,3959160&amp;dq=department+of+education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he:
:was in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional US policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, side-line the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Jørgen Jensehaugen.  ''Arab-Israeli Diplomacy under Carter:  The US, Israel and the Palestinians'' (2018) p. 178, quoted [https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/4083976/h-diplo-roundtable-xx-36-j%C3%B8rgen-jensehaugen-arab-israeli on H-DIPLO])&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 4, 1977 address to African officials at the United Nations, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to "see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries" and pointed to their unified efforts on "the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=6745 |title=United Nations Remarks at a Working Luncheon for Officials of African Nations |publisher=American Presidency Project |date=October 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined the U.S. wanting "to work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular" and to do away with racial issues such as apartheid and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=6849 |title=The President's News Conference |date=October 27, 1977 |publisher=American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter visited [[Nigeria]] from March 31 – April 3, 1978, the trip being an attempt by the Carter administration to improve relations with the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/31/archives/carter-trip-to-nigeria-culminates-long-effort-to-improve-relations.html |title=Carter Trip to Nigeria Culminates Long Effort to Improve Relations |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=March 31, 1978 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/nigeria |title=Presidents' Travels to Nigeria |publisher=U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter reiterated interests in convening a peace conference on the subject of Rhodesia that would involve all parties and reported that the U.S. was moving as it could.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/03/archives/new-jersey-pages-carter-seeks-talks-including-all-sides-in-rhodesia.html |title=Carter Seeks Talks Including All Sides in Rhodesia Conflict |date=April 3, 1978 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter lifting economic sanctions against [[Rhodesia]], the vote being seen by both Rhodesia and South Africa "as a potentially fatal blow to the joint diplomacy that the United States and Britain have pursued in the region for three years and to the effort to reach a compromise between the Salisbury leaders and the guerrillas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/17/archives/rhodesia-south-africa-hail-move-in-senate-to-end-curb-on-salisbury.html |title=Rhodesia, South Africa Hail Move In Senate to End Curb on Salisbury |date=May 17, 1979 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, Secretary of State Vance promised Senator [[Jesse Helms]] that when "the British governor arrives in [[Harare|Salisbury]] to implement an agreed Lancaster House settlement and the electoral process begins, the President will take prompt action to lift sanctions" against Zimbabwe Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/04/archives/carter-promises-to-stop-sanctions-after-rhodesia-political.html |title=Carter Promises to Stop Sanctions After Rhodesia Political Settlement |date=December 4, 1979 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indonesia and East Timor ====
During Carter's presidency, the United States continued to support [[Indonesia]] as a cold war ally in spite of human rights violations in East Timor.

[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|Carter and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] signing the SALT II treaty at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, June 18, 1979]]
On February 8, 1977, Carter stated he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S. in forming "a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time" and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the [[RSD-10 Pioneer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-112 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a June 13 conference, Carter reported that the U.S. would "beginning this week to work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere" and [[Paul Warnke]] would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-114 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a news conference on December 30, Carter said throughout the period of "the last few months, the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress in dealing with a long list of important issues, the most important of which is to control the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons" and that the two countries sought to conclude SALT II talks by the spring of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-115 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk of a comprehensive test ban treaty materialized with the signing of the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II]] by Carter and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] on June 18, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/19/archives/us-and-soviet-sign-strategic-arms-treaty-carter-urges-congress-to.html |title=U.S. AND SOVIET SIGN STRATEGIC ARMS TREATY; CARTER URGES CONGRESS TO SUPPORT ACCORD |date=June 19, 1979 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/this-day-in-politics-june-18-1979-119113 |title=Jimmy Carter signs Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, June 18, 1979 |first=Andrew |last=Glass |publisher=Politico |date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1980 State of the Union Address]], Carter emphasized the significance of relations between the two regions: "Now, as during the last 3 1/2 decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=33079 |title=The State of the Union Address Delivered Before a Joint Session of the Congress.

Carter was surprised by the invasion, as the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community during 1978 and 1979—reiterated as late as September 29, 1979—was that "Moscow would not intervene in force even if it appeared likely that the Khalq government was about to collapse." Indeed, Carter's diary entries from November 1979 until the Soviet invasion in late December contain only two short references to Afghanistan, and are instead preoccupied with the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran.&lt;ref name="Riedel"&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bruce Riedel |last=Riedel |first=Bruce |title=What We Won: America's Secret War in Afghanistan, 1979–1989 |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-8157-2595-4 |pages=ix–xi, 21–22, 93, 98–99, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="Kepel" /&gt; Moreover, the failure to accurately predict Soviet intentions caused American officials to reappraise the Soviet threat to both Iran and Pakistan, although it is now known that those fears were overblown. For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Carter's national security adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] that "if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate [[Baluchistan]]&amp;nbsp;... [thus] dismembering Pakistan and Iran" took on new urgency.&lt;ref name="Blight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt; These concerns were a major factor in the unrequited efforts of both the Carter and Reagan administrations to improve relations with Iran, and resulted in massive aid to Pakistan's [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. Zia's ties with the U.S. had been strained during Carter's presidency because of Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of [[Ali Bhutto]] in April 1979, but Carter told Brzezinski and secretary of state [[Cyrus Vance]] as early as January 1979 that it was vital to "repair our relationships with Pakistan" in light of the unrest in Iran.&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt; One initiative Carter authorized to achieve this goal was a collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI); through the ISI, the CIA began providing some $500,000 worth of non-lethal assistance to the mujahideen on July 3, 1979—several months prior to the Soviet invasion. The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official [[Robert Gates]], "that a substantial U.S. covert aid program" might have "raise[d] the stakes" thereby causing "the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended."&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Bob |title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4165-4336-7 |pages=145–147}} When asked whether he expected that the revelations in his memoir (combined with an apocryphal quote attributed to Brzezinski) would inspire "a mind-bending number of conspiracy theories which adamantly—and wrongly—accuse the Carter Administration of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan," Gates replied: "No, because there was no basis in fact for an allegation the administration tried to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan militarily."

In the aftermath of the invasion, Carter was determined to respond vigorously to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid to Pakistan, initiated renewed registration for the [[Selective Service System]], and [[Carter Doctrine|committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense]].&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=James |title=Jimmy Carter State of the Union Address 1980 |url=https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/speeches/su80jec.phtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015134701/http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/documents/speeches/su80jec.phtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 15, 2004 |website=Selected Speeches of Jimmy Carter |publisher=Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum |access-date=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jimmy Carter: The State of the Union Address Delivered Before a Joint Session of the Congress |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=33079 |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T. |access-date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He imposed an embargo on grain shipments to the USSR, tabled consideration of SALT II, and requested a 5% annual increase in defense spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zelizer |first1=Julian E. |title=Jimmy Carter |date=2010 |publisher=Times Books/Henry Holt and Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8050-8957-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jimmycarter00zeli/page/103 103] |url=https://archive.org/details/jimmycarter00zeli/page/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leuchtenburg |first1=William E. |title=The American President |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-517616-2 |page=577 |chapter=Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter also called for a boycott of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toohey |first=Kristine |title=The Olympic Games: A Social Science Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywy9aslk3M8C&amp;pg=PA100 |date=November 8, 2007 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-355-5 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance, although British intelligence believed "the CIA was being too alarmist about the Soviet threat to Pakistan."&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt; The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated [[Operation Cyclone|a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI]] and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, [[Ronald Reagan]], at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion. The Soviets were unable to quell the insurgency and [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrew from Afghanistan]] in 1989, precipitating the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself.&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt; However, the decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to [[Karachi]] were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon "became one of the most violent cities in the world." Pakistan also controlled which rebels received assistance: Of the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|seven mujahideen groups]] supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs—and these fundamentalists received most of the funding.&lt;ref name="Kepel" /&gt; Despite this, Carter has expressed no regrets over his decision to support what he still considers the "freedom fighters" in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt;

==== South Korea ====
During a March 9, 1977 news conference, Carter reaffirmed his interest in having a gradual withdrawal of American troops from [[South Korea]] and stated he wanted South Korea to eventually have "adequate ground forces owned by and controlled by the South Korean Government to protect themselves against any intrusion from [[North Korea]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-117 |title=The President's News Conference |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in South Korea [[John K. Singlaub]] as criticizing Carter's withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula. Later that day, Press Secretary Rex Granum announced Singlaub had been summoned to the White House by Carter, whom he also confirmed had seen the article in ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/20/archives/carter-summons-general-in-korea-over-criticism-of-withdrawal-plan.html |title=Carter Summons General in Korea Over Criticism of Withdrawal Plan |date=May 20, 1977 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter relieved Singlaub of his duties two days later on May 21 following a meeting between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/22/archives/carter-disciplines-gen-singlaub-who-attacked-his-policy-on-korea.html |title=Carter Disciplines Gen.

On April 21, 1978, Carter announced a reduction in American troops in South Korea scheduled to be released by the end of the year by two-thirds, citing a lack of action by Congress in regards to a compensatory aid package for the Seoul Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/22/archives/carter-cuts-total-of-us-troops-to-leave-south-korea-this-year.html |title=Carter Cuts Total of U.S. Troops To Leave South Korea This Year |first=Terence |last=Smith |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 22, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 21, 1977 resignation of [[Bert Lance]], who served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities prior to his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Lance, Carter Adviser, Dies at 82 ''New York Times'' August 15, 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/us/politics/bert-lance-carter-adviser-dies-at-82.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political positions ==

=== Abortion ===
Although Carter was "personally opposed" to [[abortion]], he supported legalized abortion after the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 US 113 (1973).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} As president, he did not support increased federal funding for abortion services. He was criticized by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] for not doing enough to find alternatives.&lt;ref name="strategy campaigning"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Strategy of Campaigning |last1=Skinner |first1=Kiron |last2=Kudelia |first2=Serhiy |last3=Bueno de Mesquita |first3=Bruce |last4=Rice |first4=Condoleezza |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0dCiDh4fMsC |isbn=978-0-472-11627-0 |access-date=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 29, 2012 interview with [[Laura Ingraham]], Carter expressed his current view of abortion and his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/jimmy_carter_democratic_party_should_be_more_pro-life.html |title=Jimmy Carter: Democratic Party Should Be More Pro-Life |date=March 29, 2012 |website=RealClearPolitics |access-date=August 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I never have believed that Jesus Christ would approve of abortions and that was one of the problems I had when I was president having to uphold ''Roe v. Wade'' and I did everything I could to minimize the need for abortions. I made it easy to adopt children for instance who were unwanted and also initiated the program called Women and Infant Children or WIC program that's still in existence now. But except for the times when a mother's life is in danger or when a pregnancy is caused by rape or incest I would certainly not or never have approved of any abortions. I've signed a public letter calling for the Democratic Party at the next convention to espouse my position on abortion which is to minimize the need, requirement for abortion and limit it only to women whose life {{sic}} are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest. I think if the Democratic Party would adopt that policy that would be acceptable to a lot of people who are now estranged from our party because of the abortion issue.}}

=== Death penalty ===
Carter is known for his strong opposition to the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], which he expressed during his presidential campaigns. In his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture, Carter urged "prohibition of the death penalty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/12/10/carter.transcript/ "Carter Nobel Peace Prize speech"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116064036/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/12/10/carter.transcript/ |date=November 16, 2007}}, CNN, December 10, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He has continued to speak out against the death penalty in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Elias C. |title=The Mirage of Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIl3Td_tcssC&amp;pg=PA200 |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-1-4759-4888-2 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the Governor of New Mexico, [[Bill Richardson]], Carter urged the governor to sign a bill to eliminate the death penalty and institute life in prison without parole instead. New Mexico abolished the death penalty in 2009. Carter wrote: "As you know, the United States is one of the few countries, along with nations such as Saudi Arabia, China, and Cuba, which still carry out the death penalty despite the ongoing tragedy of wrongful conviction and gross racial and class-based disparities that make impossible the fair implementation of this ultimate punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-jimmy-carter-urges-new-mexico-governor-support-death-penalty-repeal |title=NEW VOICES: Jimmy Carter Urges New Mexico Governor to Support Death Penalty Repeal &amp;#124; Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Carter wrote an [[op-ed]] in the ''[[LA Times]]'' supporting passage of a state referendum which would have ended the death penalty. He opened the article: "The process for administering the death penalty in the United States is broken beyond repair, and it is time to choose a more effective and moral alternative. California voters will have the opportunity to do this on election day."&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jimmy (October 28, 2012).

Retrieved March 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter has also called for commutations of death sentences for many death-row inmates, including Brian K. Baldwin (executed in 1999 in [[Alabama]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/wrongfulconvictions/issues/deathpenalty/Executinginnocent/alBaldwinbsummary.html |title=Brian Baldwin, Center on Wrongful Convictions |publisher=Law.northwestern.edu |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Foster]] (sentence in [[Texas]] commuted in 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/8/29/jimmy_carter_desmond_tutu_urge_texas |title=Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu Urge Texas to Stay Execution of Kenneth Foster |publisher=Democracynow.org |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/clemency |title=Clemency &amp;#124; Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Troy Davis]] (executed in Georgia in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=The Carter Center |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/clemency_troy_davis.html |title=Carter Center Press Releases – President Carter Calls for Clemency for Troy Davis |publisher=The Carter Center |date=September 19, 2008 |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equality for women ===
In October 2000, Carter, a third-generation Southern Baptist, severed connections to the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] over its opposition to women as pastors. What led Carter to take this action was a doctrinal statement by the Convention, adopted in June 2000, advocating a [[Biblical literalism|literal interpretation of the Bible]]. This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: "an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them." ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action "the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=October 21, 2000 |title=Carter Sadly Turns Back On National Baptist Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment. He said that the view that women are inferior is not confined to one faith, "nor, tragically does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple." Carter stated:

{{quote|The truth is that male religious leaders have had—and still have—an option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women. They have, for their own selfish ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter. Their continuing choice provides the foundation or justification for much of the pervasive persecution and abuse of women throughout the world. This is in clear violation not just of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Apostle Paul, Moses and the prophets, Muhammad, and founders of other great religions—all of whom have called for proper and equitable treatment of all the children of God. It is time we had the courage to challenge these views.&lt;ref name="losing"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130704055257/http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/losing-my-religion-for-equality-20090714-dk0v.html Losing my religion for equality], Opinion, Theage.com.au, July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2014, he published ''A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence, and Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence, and Power |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4767-7395-7 |oclc=868276576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Same-sex marriage ===
Carter has stated that he supports [[same-sex marriage]] in civil ceremonies.&lt;ref name="HuffPost Canada"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/jimmy-carter-gay-marriage_n_7744390 |title=Jimmy Carter Says Jesus Would Approve Of Gay Marriage |date=July 7, 2015 |work=HuffPost Canada |language=en-CA |access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also stated that he believes [[Jesus]] would also support it, saying "I believe Jesus would. I don't have any verse in scripture. ... I believe Jesus would approve gay marriage, but that's just my own personal belief. I think Jesus would encourage any love affair if it was honest and sincere and was not damaging to anyone else, and I don't see that gay marriage damages anyone else".&lt;ref&gt;Buxton, Ryan, July 7, 2015, "Jimmy Carter Says Jesus Would Approve Of Gay Marriage".

In October 2014, Carter argued ahead of a Supreme Court ruling that legalization of same-sex marriage should be left up to the states and not mandated by federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jimmy Carter: Gay marriage should be up to states |url=https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2014/10/27/17977371/ |work=USA Today |date=October 27, 2014 |access-date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race in politics ===
Carter ignited debate in September 2009 when he stated, "I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President [[Barack Obama]] is based on the fact that he is a black man, that he is African-American".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32869276 |title=White House disputes Carter's analysis – Capitol Hill |publisher=NBC News |date=September 16, 2009 |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama disagreed with Carter's assessment. On [[CNN]], Obama stated, "Are there people out there who don't like me because of race? I'm sure there are... that's not the overriding issue here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Michael |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/59451-obama-plays-down-role-of-race-in-criticism |title=Obama plays down role of race in criticism – The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Thehill.com |date=September 19, 2009 |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Torture ===
In a 2008 interview with [[Amnesty International]], Carter criticized the use of torture at [[Guantánamo Bay]], saying that it "contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|tkz_FLxaKnI|Torture can never be justified}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the next president should make the promise that the United States will "never again torture a prisoner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Freedland, Jonathan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/07/usforeignpolicy.jimmycarter |title=I have moral authority |work=The Guardian |date=June 6, 2008 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
In an October 2013 interview, Carter labeled the Affordable Care Act President Obama's major accomplishment and said "the implementation of it now is questionable at best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/jimmy-carter-affordable-care-act-099193 |title=Carter: ACA rollout 'questionable' |date=October 31, 2013 |first=Jose |last=Delreal |publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, Carter concluded the U.S. would eventually see the implementation of a [[single-payer healthcare]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/07/23/jimmy-carter-believes-u-s-will-eventually-go-to-single-payer-health-system/ |title=Jimmy Carter Believes U.S. Will Eventually Go to Single-Payer Health System |first=Louise |last=Radnofsky |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/343481-jimmy-carter-predicts-us-will-eventually-have-single-payer-healthcare |title=Jimmy Carter predicts US will eventually have single-payer healthcare system |first=Robin |last=Eberhardt |newspaper=The Hill |date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaign finance laws ===

Carter vigorously opposed the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' that struck down limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions, going so far as to saying that the U.S. is "no longer a functioning democracy" and now has a system of "unlimited political bribery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lavender |first=Paige |date=July 31, 2015 |title=Jimmy Carter Blasts U.S. 'Political Bribery' |url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-carter-us-politics_us_55bbb3c9e4b0d4f33a02ae2b |work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter and his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]] are well known for their work as volunteers with [[Habitat for Humanity]], a Georgia-based philanthropy that helps low-income working people around the world to build and buy their own homes and access clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.habitat.org/newsroom/2012archive/11_30_2012_Greif_Supports_CWP.aspx |title=Greif, Inc. helps support Habitat for Humanity's 29th Annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project |publisher=Habitat for Humanity |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's hobbies include painting,&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jimmy, Letter to Artist [[Mia LaBerge]], February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fly-fishing]], woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2002/carter-bio.html |title=Jimmy Carter – Biographical |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has an interest in poetry, particularly the works of [[Dylan Thomas]].&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15661342 |title=Jimmy Carter to welcome visitors to Dylan Thomas house |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=November 9, 2011 |access-date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in [[Poets' Corner]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]; this was an idea that came to fruition in 1982.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/dylan-thomas |title=Dylan Thomas |website=Westminster Abbey |publisher=The Dean and Chapter of Westminster |date=2015 |access-date=November 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222105450/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/dylan-thomas |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20068169,00.html |title=Jimmy Carter's Crusade for Dylan Thomas Wins a Supporter—his Grateful Widow, Caitlin |website=People |first=M.J. |last=Wilson |date=June 27, 1977 |access-date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was also a personal friend of [[Elvis Presley]], whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elvis Presley and Politics |url=http://www.neatorama.com/2015/07/15/Elvis-Presley-and-Politics/ |website=Neatorama |access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, in order to help [[George Klein (DJ)|George Klein]]'s criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elvis Presley, Reluctant Rebel: His Life and Our Times |date=2011 |publisher=David Luhrssen and Glen Jeansonne |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUXPpQAhsCkC&amp;q=elvis+presley+jimmy+carter+george+klein&amp;pg=PA195 |isbn=978-0-313-35904-0 |access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nash |first1=Alanna |title=Elvis and the Memphis Mafia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jDBAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=elvis+presley+jimmy+carter+call&amp;pg=PT607 |isbn=978-1-84513-759-5 |date=February 1, 2012 |access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent and cited barbiturate abuse as the cause of this; although he phoned the White House several times again, this would be the last time Carter would speak to Elvis Presley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Takes: Elvis Presley on the Line |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/double-take/takes-elvis-presley-on-the-line |website=The New Yorker |publisher=Erin Overbey |access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had "changed the face of American popular culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement by the President on the Death of Elvis Presley |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7969/ |website=The American Presidency Project |last1=Peters |first1=Gerhard |last2=Woolley |first2=John T. |access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="NYT baptist"&gt;Somini Sengupta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html "Carter Sadly Turns Back on National Baptist Body"], ''The New York Times'', October 21, 2000.

Revised edition. p. 22. {{ISBN|0-8054-1707-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that [[Jesus]] was the driving force in his life. Carter had been greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man. It asked, "If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations with Carter |isbn=978-1-55587-801-6 |year=1998 |page=14 |first1=Jimmy |last1=Carter |first2=Don |last2=Richardson |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Carter severed his membership with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], saying the group's doctrines did not align with his Christian beliefs, while still a member of the [[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="NYT baptist" /&gt;

=== Family ===
Carter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria Spann]] (1926–1990) and [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth Stapleton]] (1929–1983), and brother [[Billy Carter]] (1937–1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert D.

== Health and longevity ==

=== Health problems ===

On August 3, 2015, Carter underwent elective surgery to remove "a small mass" on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be "excellent". On August 12, however, Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had [[metastasized]], without specifying where the cancer had originated.&lt;ref name="CNBC cancer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pramuk |first=Jacob |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/12/former-president-jimmy-carter-reveals-he-has-cancer.html |title=Former President Jimmy Carter reveals he has cancer |publisher=CNBC |date=August 12, 2015 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |access-date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, he disclosed that [[melanoma]] had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the [[immunotherapy]] drug [[pembrolizumab]] and was about to start [[radiation therapy]].

=== Longevity ===

Carter, the earliest-serving [[Living presidents of the United States|living former president]] since the death of Gerald Ford in 2006, became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration, in 2017 at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/4639799/jimmy-carter-beat-cancer-donald-trump-inauguration/ |title=How Jimmy Carter Beat Cancer and Became the Oldest President to Attend an Inauguration |first=Katie |last=Reilly |date=January 20, 2017 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jimmy Carter is poised to be the president who has lived the longest in US history |last=Jacobo |first=Julia |date=March 21, 2019 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jimmy-carter-now-oldest-living-president-us-history/story?id=61835536 |work=ABC News |access-date=October 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he gained the distinction of being the nation's [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]], when he surpassed the lifespan of George H.

== Public image and legacy ==
=== Public opinion ===
Carter and [[Gerald Ford]] were compared in exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, which Carter won. Many voters still held Gerald Ford's pardon of Nixon against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/27/opinion/polls/main2301584.shtml |publisher=CBS News |title=Polls: Ford's Image Improved Over Time |date=December 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning Southerner.&lt;ref name="Independent 2009-01-22" /&gt; Carter began his term with a 66&amp;nbsp;percent approval rating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/113923/History-Foretells-Obama-First-Job-Approval-Rating.aspx |title=What History Foretells for Obama's First Job Approval Rating |publisher=Gallup.com |date=January 22, 2009 |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had dropped to 34&amp;nbsp;percent approval by the time he left office, with 55&amp;nbsp;percent disapproving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/113770/Bush-Presidency-Closes-34-Approval-61-Disapproval.aspx |title=Bush Presidency Closes With 34% Approval, 61% Disapproval |publisher=Gallup.com |access-date=December 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119053947/http://www.gallup.com/poll/113770/Bush-Presidency-Closes-34-Approval-61-Disapproval.aspx |archive-date=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980 campaign, former California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. What many people believed to be Carter's personal attention to detail, his pessimistic attitude, his seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people were accentuated in contrast to what many saw as Reagan's charismatic charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Kennedy-Bush/Jimmy-Carter-Disaffection-of-the-public.html |title=Disaffection of the public – Jimmy Carter – election |publisher=Presidentprofiles.com |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1989-05-18"&gt;{{cite news |first=E.
