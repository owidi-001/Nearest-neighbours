&lt;!--&gt;Medals won at the US National Championships must NOT be added to the medal record. Medals earned at the City of Jesolo Trophy and the US Classic are not added to the medal record as well, according to consensus.&lt;--&gt;
&lt;!--&gt;The above statement does not appear to be in practice whatsoever, as most other well-known American gymnasts have world cup and national championship medals listed.&lt;--&gt;
&lt;!--&gt;Most gymnasts' pages have been updated to have National Champs, US Classic, and Jesolo removed (unless Jesolo was their only international experience.&lt;--&gt;
&lt;!--&gt;Medals should only include competitions in which they are representing their country (no domestic meets)&lt;--&gt;
&lt;!-- So National Championships are not included but All-Around World Cup medals should be? They are international and certainly more prestigious than the Pacific Rim Championships. --&gt;
&lt;!-- I'm all for adding World Cup medals. Most gymnasts' pages have them anyway. --&gt;

In the all-around, Biles performed cleanly on all four events, bettering her bars score from qualifications by more than a point, and won her second consecutive world all-around title ahead of Ross and Romanian [[Larisa Iordache]]. Biles became the second American woman to repeat as world all-around champion, following Miller (1993 and 1994), and the first woman of any nationality to do so since Russia's [[Svetlana Khorkina]] (2001 and 2003).&lt;ref name=w2013/&gt; Biles finished behind North Korea's Hong Un Jong in the vault competition, taking her second consecutive silver medal in that event. She won the gold in the balance-beam final ahead of China's Bai Yawen and the gold in the floor exercise final, again, ahead of Iordache. This brought her total of World Championship gold medals to six, the most ever by an American gymnast, surpassing Miller's five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USA's Simone Biles returns with four world golds and lots of buzz (but no bee stings) |url=http://www.foxsports.com/olympics/story/gymnast-simone-biles-returns-to-us-with-4-world-golds-no-bee-stings-101514 |access-date=October 31, 2015 |work=[[Fox Sports]] |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924105531/http://www.foxsports.com/olympics/story/gymnast-simone-biles-returns-to-us-with-4-world-golds-no-bee-stings-101514 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, Biles competed in the Women's Qualification at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Along with helping the US team qualify in first place to the team final with a score of 185.238 (9.959 points ahead of the second-place team, China) she individually qualified as the top gymnast into four of the five individual finals: the all-around with a score of 62.366, vault with an average score of 16.050, balance beam with a score of 15.633, and floor exercise with a score of 15.733. 

On August 9, Biles won her first Olympic gold medal in the gymnastics team event. The only gymnast for Team USA to compete on all four events in the final, she contributed an all-around score of 61.833 (15.933 on vault, 14.800 on bars, 15.300 on beam and 15.800 on floor) as the Americans won the gold medal with a score of 184.897, over eight points ahead of the silver medal Russian team.

Biles had the highest scores on vault, balance beam, and floor; she had the only score over 15 on balance beam in the finals. She and Raisman became the second pair of American gymnasts to win gold and silver in the individual all-around, after [[Nastia Liukin]] and [[Shawn Johnson]] in [[Gymnastics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's artistic individual all-around|2008]]. 

In the vault final, she scored 15.900 for her Amânar and 16.033 for her Cheng to win her second individual gold medal with an average score of 15.966, more than 0.7 points ahead of second-place finisher [[Maria Paseka]] of Russia and third-place finisher [[Giulia Steingruber]] of [[Switzerland]]. 

In the balance beam final, she grabbed the beam with her hands (a mandatory 0.5 point deduction) after underrotating her front tuck and scored a 14.733. Despite her mistake, she won the bronze medal behind teammate [[Laurie Hernandez]] (who won silver with a score of 15.333), and [[Sanne Wevers]] of the Netherlands (who won the gold medal scoring 15.466). 

In the floor exercise final, she won gold with a score of 15.966. Teammate [[Aly Raisman]] won silver with a score of 15.500 and [[Amy Tinkler]] of Great Britain won bronze scoring 14.933.

Biles is the first female gymnast since [[Lilia Podkopayeva]] (UKR) in 1996 to win the all around gold as well as an event final gold, and the first female gymnast since Podkopayeva to win the Olympic all around title while holding the World and European/American individual all around titles. Biles joins Latynina (1956–1960), Čáslavská (1964–1968) and [[Tourischeva]] (1968–1972), as the fourth female gymnast to win every major all-around title in an Olympic cycle.

Biles joined [[Mary Lou Retton]] in 1984, [[Shannon Miller]] in 1992 and [[Nastia Liukin]] in 2008 in winning five women's gymnastics medals at a single Olympiad, along with Szabo (ROU, 1984), [[Nadia Comaneci]] (ROU, 1976) and [[Karin Janz]] (East Germany, 1972). [[Olga Mostepanova]] (USSR) also won five gold medals at the Alternate Olympics in 1984. The overall record for most women's Olympic gymnastics medals at a single games (majority gold), remains six medals (Latynina, 1956, 1960 and 1964, Keleti, 1956,  Caslavska, 1968, [[Daniela Silivas]], 1988).

Biles and her teammate [[Gabby Douglas]] are the only American female gymnasts to win both the individual all-around gold and team gold at the same Olympiad. Douglas won both in the 2012 London games.
