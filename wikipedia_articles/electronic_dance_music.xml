'''Electronic dance music''' ('''EDM'''), also known as '''dance music''', '''club music''', or simply '''dance''',&lt;ref name="Koskoff_44"&gt;{{harvp|Koskoff|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a broad range of percussive [[electronic music]] genres made largely for [[nightclub]]s, [[rave]]s, and [[List of electronic dance music festivals|festivals]]. It is generally [[Record producer|produced]] for [[gapless playback|playback]] by [[DJ]]s who create seamless selections of tracks, called a [[DJ mix|mix]], by [[segue]]ing from one recording to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Butler|2006|pp=12–13, 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a [[live PA]].

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of [[Rave music|raving]], [[pirate radio]]s, PartyCrews, underground festivals and an upsurge of interest in [[club culture]], EDM achieved widespread mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not universal outside of [[New York City]]; although both [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[Chicago house]] music were influential both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the [[record industry]] remained openly hostile to it. There was also a perceived association between EDM and [[drug culture]], which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.&lt;ref name=guardian-conquered /&gt;

Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, largely in the United States and Australia. By the early 2010s, the term "electronic dance music" and the [[initialism]] "EDM" was being [[Push–pull strategy#Push–pull music marketing future|pushed]] by the American [[music industry]] and [[Music journalism|music press]] in an effort to [[rebranding|rebrand]] American rave culture.&lt;ref name=guardian-conquered/&gt; Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]], as well as their respective subgenres.&lt;ref name="genres"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2001|title=Genres, Subgenres, Sub-Subgenres and More: Musical and Social Difference Within Electronic/Dance Music Communities|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=commstud_pubs|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=13|pages=59–75|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2001.tb00013.x|author=Kembrew McLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burgess115"&gt;[[Richard James Burgess]] (2014), ''The History of Music Production'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 page 115], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="armada"&gt;[https://www.armadamusic.com/edm-electronic-dance-music EDM – ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC], [[Armada Music]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Electronic music|History of DJing}}
Various EDM genres have evolved over the last 40 years, for example; [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[dance-pop]] etc. &lt;!--Editors, please don't expand this section in an effort to describe every genre. The point is not to provide a genre guide, but to refer people to the "list of electronic music genres" page, and to briefly cover the relationship between the genres and "EDM".--&gt;Stylistic variation within an established EDM genre can lead to the emergence of what is called a [[subgenre]]. Hybridization, where elements of two or more genres are combined, can lead to the emergence of an entirely new genre of EDM.&lt;ref name="genres" /&gt;

===Precursors===
{{See also|P-Funk}}
In the late 1960s bands such as [[Silver Apples]] created electronic music intended for dancing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xReSZczxSsU]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples of music that influenced later electronic dance music include Jamaican [[dub music]] during the late 1960s to 1970s,&lt;ref name="armada" /&gt; the synthesizer-based [[disco]] music of Italian producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] in the late 1970s, and the [[electro-pop]] of [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] in the mid-to-late 1970s.&lt;ref name="burgess115" /&gt;

====Dub====
{{Main|Dub music}}
{{See also|Sound system (Jamaican)|Deejay (Jamaican)}}

Author Michael Veal considers [[dub music]], a [[Jamaican music]] stemming from [[roots reggae]] and [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] culture that flourished between 1968 and 1985, to be one of the important precursors to contemporary electronic dance music.&lt;ref name="veal"/&gt; Dub productions were [[#Remixing in Electronic music|remixed]] reggae tracks that emphasized rhythm, fragmented lyrical and melodic elements, and reverberant textures.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Veal (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85 ''Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae'', pages 85–86], [[Wesleyan University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The music was pioneered by studio engineers, such as Sylvan Morris, [[King Tubby]], [[Errol Thompson (audio engineer)|Errol Thompson]], [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]].&lt;ref name="veal"&gt;Michael Veal (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP54 ''Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae'', pages 26–44, "Electronic Music in Jamaica"], [[Wesleyan University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their productions included forms of [[tape editing]] and [[sound processing]] that Veal considers comparable to techniques used in ''[[musique concrète]]''. Dub producers made improvised deconstructions of existing [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] reggae mixes by using the studio [[mixing board]] as a performance instrument. They also foregrounded spatial effects such as [[Reverberation unit|reverb]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] by using [[Mixing console#Auxiliary send routing|auxiliary send routings]] creatively.&lt;ref name="veal"/&gt; The [[Roland Space Echo]], manufactured by [[Roland Corporation]], was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truesdell|first=Cliff|title=Mastering Digital Audio Production: The Professional Music Workflow with Mac OS X|date=2007|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=9780470165768|page=310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMOMjt6FGK0C&amp;pg=PA310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the limited electronic equipment available to dub pioneers such as King Tubby and Lee "Scratch" Perry, their experiments in remix culture were musically cutting-edge.&lt;ref name="cambridge20"&gt;Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&amp;pg=PA20 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 20], [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambient dub]] was pioneered by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists, using DJ-inspired [[Ambient music|ambient]] electronics, complete with drop-outs, echo, equalization and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] electronic effects. It featured layering techniques and incorporated elements of [[world music]], deep [[bass line]]s and harmonic sounds.&lt;ref name="eem"&gt;{{cite book |title=Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture |last=Holmes |first=Thom |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0203929599 |page=403 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCthQ-bec-QC |access-date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as a long echo delay were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toop|first1=David|title=Ocean of Sound|date=1995|publisher=Serpent's Tail|isbn=9781852423827|page=[https://archive.org/details/oceanofsoundaeth0000toop/page/115 115]|url=https://archive.org/details/oceanofsoundaeth0000toop/page/115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hip hop====
{{Main|Hip hop music}}
{{See also|Rapping|Turntablism}}
[[Hip hop music]] has had some influence in the development of electronic dance music since the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Inspired by Jamaican sound system culture [[Jamaican-American]] DJ [[Kool Herc]] introduced large bass heavy speaker rigs to the [[Bronx]].&lt;ref name="places"&gt;Arthur P. Molella, Anna Karvellas (2015),[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyDaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47 "Places of Invention,"] Smithsonian Institution, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; His parties are credited with having kick-started the [[New York City|New York]] hip-hop movement in 1973.&lt;ref name="places"/&gt;  A technique developed by DJ Kool Herc that became popular in [[hip hop|hip hop culture]] was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables, in alternation, and at the point where a track featured a [[break (music)|break]]. This technique was further used to manually [[loop (music)|loop]] a purely [[percussive]] break, leading to what was later called a [[Break (music)#Break beat (element of music)|break beat]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 105], [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turntablism]] has origins in the invention of the [[direct-drive turntable]],&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;Brian Coleman, [https://medium.com/@briancoleman/the-technics-1200-hammer-of-the-gods-xxl-fall-1998-5b93180a67da The Technics 1200 — Hammer Of The Gods], [[Medium (website)|Medium]]&lt;/ref&gt; by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (now [[Panasonic]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', May 21, 1977, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XCMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT140 page 140]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Matsushita released it as the [[Technics (brand)|SP-10]],&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; the first direct-drive turntable on the market,&lt;ref name="reverb"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Record Player Part II: The Rise and Fall|url=https://reverb.com/news/history-of-the-record-player-part-ii-the-rise-and-fall|website=[[Reverb.com]]|access-date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first in their influential [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series of turntables.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&amp;pg=PA515 ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies'', page 515], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential turntable was the [[Technics SL-1200]],&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972.&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] [[Disc jockey|DJs]] used turntables as musical instruments in their own right and [[virtuosic]] use developed into a creative practice called turntablism.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

====Disco====
{{Main|Disco}}
{{See also|Euro disco|Italo disco|Hi-NRG}}
In 1974, [[George McCrae]]'s early [[disco]] hit "[[Rock Your Baby]]" was one of the first records to use a [[drum machine]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin Russ (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9h5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 ''Sound Synthesis and Sampling'', page 83], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; an early [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] rhythm machine.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Mike Collins (2014),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdEABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320 ''In the Box Music Production: Advanced Tools and Techniques for Pro Tools'', page 320], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of drum machines in disco production was influenced by [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s "[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]" (1971), with its rhythm echoed in McCrae's "Rock Your Baby",&lt;ref name="echols21"&gt;Alice Echols (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DzrvOAA2tvAC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture'', page 21], [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Timmy Thomas]]' "[[Why Can't We Live Together]]" (1972).&lt;ref name="echols250"&gt;Alice Echols (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DzrvOAA2tvAC&amp;pg=PA250 ''Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture'', page 250], [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="echols21"/&gt; Disco producer [[Biddu]] used [[synthesizer]]s in several disco songs from 1976 to 1977, including "Bionic Boogie" from ''Rain Forest'' (1976),&lt;ref name="bionic_boogie"&gt;{{Discogs release|2809569|Biddu Orchestra – Bionic Boogie}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Soul Coaxing" (1977),&lt;ref name="soal_coaxing"&gt;{{Discogs release|874902|Biddu Orchestra – Soul Coaxing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Eastern Man'' and ''Futuristic Journey''&lt;ref name="cduniverse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Futuristic Journey And Eastern Man CD|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7735242|publisher=[[CD Universe]]|access-date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discogs_futuristic"&gt;{{Discogs master|109852|Biddu Orchestra – Futuristic Journey|type=album}}&lt;/ref&gt; (recorded from 1976 to 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{allMusic|album|r1401917|Futuristic Journey and Eastern Man}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts like [[Donna Summer]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[Earth, Wind, and Fire]], [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]], and the [[Village People]] helped define the late 1970s' disco sound. In 1977, [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] produced "[[I Feel Love]]" for Donna Summer. It became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesized backing track. Other disco producers, most famously American producer [[Tom Moulton]], grabbed ideas and techniques from [[dub music]] (which came with the increased [[Jamaica]]n migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the [[Four on the floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] style that dominated.&lt;ref name="Billboard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/search/charts?page=41&amp;f&amp;#91;0&amp;#93;=ts_chart_artistname%3A*donna%20summer*&amp;f&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;=ss_bb_type%3Achart_item&amp;type=2&amp;artist=donna%20summer|title=Chart Search: Billboard|work=billboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Synth-pop====
{{Main|Synth-pop}}
{{See also|New wave music|Electropop|Minimal wave|City pop}}
Synth-pop (short for 'synthesizer pop';{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=60}} also called 'techno-pop')&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite journal|title=unknown|journal=[[Stereo Review]]|date=1983|volume=48|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVkJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22technopop%22+%22synthpop%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electrosynth"&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|Schedel|Wilson|2013|p=97|loc="synth pop (also called electro pop, techno pop, and the like)"}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|2004|p=2153|loc="Techno-pop, also termed synth-pop or electro-pop"}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subgenre of [[new wave music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{allMusic|subgenre|synth-pop-ma0000002887|Synth Pop}}&lt;/ref&gt; that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the [[synthesizer]] as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the "[[Krautrock]]" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

Early synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]]) in the United States.

The use of digital sampling and [[Loop (music)|looping]] in popular music was pioneered by Japanese [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tokyo city guide|author=Mayumi Yoshida Barakan &amp; Judith Connor Greer|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-8048-1964-5|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJbd43uxLiMC&amp;pg=PA144|access-date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thevinyldistrict"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You're Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|access-date=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="condry_59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockin"/&gt; Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.&lt;ref name="condry_59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condry|first=Ian|title=Hip-hop Japan: rap and the paths of cultural globalization|year=2006|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=0-8223-3892-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37QWE3yRY-4C&amp;pg=PA59|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game/Firecracker]]" (1978) interpolated a [[Martin Denny]] melody,&lt;ref name="guardian_ymo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica&amp;nbsp;– and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=25 May 2011|date=4 July 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sampled ''[[Space Invaders]]''&lt;ref name="wire_2002"&gt;{{citation|title=The Wire, Issues 221–226|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=2002|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyFMAAAAYAAJ|access-date=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video game music|video game sounds]].&lt;ref name="guardian_ymo"/&gt; ''[[Technodelic]]'' (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and [[Loop (music)|loops]].&lt;ref name="thevinyldistrict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rockin"/&gt; The album was produced using [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s LMD-649 digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.&lt;ref name="rockin"&gt;''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140–141]{{Better source needed|date=April 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese [[synthpop]] artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as [[:ja:真鍋ちえみ|Chiemi Manabe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chiemi-Manabe-%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%AD%B0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-/release/4389700|title=Chiemi Manabe – 不思議・少女|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hideki Matsutake|Logic System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Logic-System-Orient-Express/release/703523|title=Logic System – Orient Express|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance music in the 1980s===

The emergence of electronic dance music in the 1980s was shaped by the development of several new [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly those from the Japanese [[Roland Corporation]]. The [[Roland TR-808]] (often abbreviated as the "808") notably played an important role in the evolution of dance music,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbtJAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22mark+vail%22+808&amp;pg=PT72|title=Keyboard Presents the Evolution of Electronic Dance Music|last=Kirn|first=Peter|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-61713-446-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" (1982), made it very popular on dancefloors.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/14/roland-launch-new-instruments-808-909-303|title=Roland launch new versions of the iconic 808, 909 and 303 instruments|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=14 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track, which also featured the melody line from Kraftwerk's [[Trans-Europe Express (song)|Trans-Europe Express]], informed the development of electronic dance music,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/433944/10-great-songs-built-around-the-808/2|title=10 great songs built around the 808|last=Hawking|first=Tom|date=16 January 2014|newspaper=Flavorwire|language=en-US|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subgenres including [[Miami bass]] and [[Detroit techno]], and popularized the 808 as a "fundamental element of futuristic sound".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/slaves-to-the-rhythm-1.771508|title=Slaves to the rhythm|last=Anderson|first=Jason|date=27 November 2008|publisher=CBC News|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]],'' "Planet Rock" "didn't so much put the 808 on the map so much as reorient an entire world of [[post-disco]] dance music around it".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2016/12/_808_the_movie_is_a_must_watch_doc_for_music_nerds.html|title=808s and heart eyes|last=Hamilton |first=Jack|date=16 December 2016|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roland TR-909]], [[Roland TB-303|TB-303]] and [[Roland Juno-60|Juno-60]] similarly influenced electronic dance music such as [[techno]], [[house music|house]] and [[Acid house|acid]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://complex.com/music/2014/09/roland-tr-909-tracks/|title=Nine Great Tracks That Use the Roland TR-909|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mixmag.net/feature/909-tracks-using-the-tr-909|title=9 of the best 909 tracks using the TR-909|work=Mixmag|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bma7eq/synth-roland-juno-feature|title=The Story of the Synth that Changed Pop Forever|website=www.vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post-disco era that followed the backlash against "[[disco]]" which began in the mid to late 1979, which in the United States lead to civil unrest and a riot in [[Chicago]] known as the [[Disco Demolition Night]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-shadow-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; an underground movement of "stripped-down" disco inspired music featuring "radically different sounds"&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-AMG1-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; started to emerge on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Kellmann-15|[15]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-18|[Note 1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This new scene was seen primarily in the [[New York metropolitan area]] and was initially led by the [[urban contemporary]] artists that were responding to the over-commercialization and subsequent demise of disco culture.

Much of the music produced during this time was, like disco, catering to a [[Gramophone record|singles-driven]] market.&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-AMG1-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; At this time creative control started shifting to independent record companies, less established producers, and club DJs.&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-AMG1-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Other dance styles that began to become popular during the post-disco era include [[dance-pop]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Slant-20|[19]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-21|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Boogie (genre)|boogie]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-AMG1-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Electro (music)|electro]], [[Hi-NRG]], [[Italo disco]], [[House music|house]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Slant-20|[19]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-22|[21]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-DancingMachines-23|[22]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-24|[23]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and [[techno]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-DancingMachines-23|[22]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-25|[24]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-26|[25]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-27|[26]]][[Electronic dance music#cite note-28|[27]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In the early 1980s, electro (short for "electro-funk") emerged as a fusion of [[Synthpop|electro-pop]], [[funk]], and [[Boogie (genre)|boogie]]. Also called electro-funk or electro-boogie, but later shortened to electro, cited pioneers include [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]],&lt;ref name="wire_1996"&gt;{{citation|title=The Wire, Volumes 143–148|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=1996|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qtw4AQAAIAAJ|access-date=2011-05-25}} (see [http://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/essays/a-z-of-electro online link])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zapp|date=August 1999|journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|volume=6|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D Train (music group)|D.Train]],&lt;ref name=ElectroHistoryRoots&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/articles/what.html|title=Electro-Funk &gt; WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN ?|publisher=Greg Wilson on electrofunkroots.co.uk|access-date=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sinnamon]].&lt;ref name=ElectroHistoryRoots/&gt; Early hip hop and rap combined with German and Japanese [[electropop]] influences such as [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] inspired the birth of electro.&lt;ref name="Electro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electro|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/electro-ma0000002571|access-date=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the electronic sound developed, instruments such as the [[bass guitar]] and [[drumset|drums]] were replaced by [[synthesizer]]s and most notably by iconic [[drum machines]], particularly the [[Roland TR-808]] and the [[Yamaha DX7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDdWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=yamaha+dx7+replace+live+drums+electro-pop|title=Nuts and Bolts|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses of the TR-808 include several [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] tracks in 1980–1981, the 1982 track "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" by [[Afrika Bambaataa]], and the 1982 song "[[Sexual Healing]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2008/11/27/f-history-of-the-808.html |title=Slaves to the rhythm |access-date=2008-11-28 |work=CBC News |date=November 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201041939/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2008/11/27/f-history-of-the-808.html |archive-date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, producer [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], with [[Afrika Bambaataa]], released the seminal "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]", which was influenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra, used Kraftwerk samples, and had drum beats supplied by the TR-808. Planet Rock was followed later that year by another breakthrough electro record, "[[Nunk]]" by [[Warp 9]]. In 1983, [[Hashim Music|Hashim]] created an electro-funk sound with "Al-Naafyish (The Soul)"&lt;ref name="wire_1996"/&gt; that influenced [[Herbie Hancock]], resulting in his hit single "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" the same year.

Some made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape, and sometimes mixed in effects, drum machines, and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation. The hypnotic electronic dance song "On and On", produced in 1984 by [[Chicago]] DJ [[Jesse Saunders]] and co-written by [[Vince Lawrence]], had elements that became staples of the early house sound, such as the [[Roland TB-303]] [[bass synthesizer]] and minimal vocals as well as a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] (specifically [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]]) [[drum machine]] and [[Korg]] (specifically [[Korg Poly-61|Poly-61]]) [[synthesizer]].

"On and On" is sometimes cited as the 'first house record',&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Euan.

Following this, a number of house inspired releases such as "[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up The Volume]]" by [[MARRS|M{{pipe}}A{{pipe}}R{{pipe}}R{{pipe}}S]] (1987), "[[Theme from S'Express]]" by [[S'Express]] (1988), and "[[Doctorin' the House]]" by [[Coldcut]] (1988) entered the pop charts.

In the mid 1980s house music thrived on the small Balearic Island of [[Ibiza, Spain]]. The Balearic sound was the spirit of the music emerging from the island at that time; the combination of old vinyl rock, pop, reggae, and disco records paired with an “anything goes” attitude made Ibiza a hub of drug-induced musical experimentation.&lt;ref name="boilerroom.tv"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://boilerroom.tv/balearic-beat/|title=What Is Balearic Beat? – BOILER ROOM|date=2014-07-12|newspaper=BOILER ROOM|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A club called Amnesia, whose resident DJ, [[Alfredo Fiorito]], pioneered [[Balearic house]], was the center of the scene.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/12/electronicmusic|title=The birth of rave|last=Warren|first=Emma|date=2007-08-12|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesia became known across Europe and by the mid to late 1980s it was drawing people from all over the continent.&lt;ref name="Amnesia - history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesia.es/history/en|title=Amnesia – history|website=www.amnesia.es|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, house music had become the most popular form of club music in Europe, with [[acid house]] developing as a notable trend in the UK and Germany in the same year.&lt;ref name="Rietveld 1998:40–50"&gt;{{harvp|Rietveld|1998|pp=40–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK an established warehouse party [[subculture]], centered on the [[British African-Caribbean people|British African-Caribbean]] [[sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] scene fueled underground after-parties that featured dance music exclusively. Also in 1988, the [[Balearic beat|Balearic]] party vibe associated with Ibiza's DJ Alfredo was transported to London, when [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Paul Oakenfold]] opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both places became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that [[MDMA]] gained prominence as a party drug. Other important UK clubs included Back to Basics in [[Leeds]], Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and [[The Haçienda]] in Manchester, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American [[Underground music|underground]] dance music.{{refn|{{harvp|Fikentscher|2000|p=5}}, in discussing the definition of underground dance music as it relates to [[post-disco]] music in America, states that: "The prefix 'underground' does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music—and its cultural context—are familiar only to a small number of informed persons. Underground also points to the [[sociological]] function of the music, framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away, to a large degree, from mainstream society, mass media, and those empowered to enforce prevalent moral and aesthetic codes and values."|group=Note}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rietveld|1998|pp=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of house and acid house paved the way for [[Detroit Techno]], a style that was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with Detroit clubs catching up later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brewster|2006|pp=398–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Techno first came into use after a release of a 10 Records/Virgin Records compilation titled ''Techno: The Dance Sound of Detroit'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (1999:71) notes that: "Detroit's music had hitherto reached British ears as a subset of Chicago house; [Neil] Rushton and the Belleville Three decided to fasten on the word techno – a term that had been bandied about but never stressed – in order to define Detroit as a distinct genre." Reynolds, S., Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture, Routledge, New York 1999 ({{ISBN|978-0415923736}})&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's "[[Derrick May (musician)#Career|Strings of Life]]" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, "Nude Photo" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 [[house music]] boom (see [[Second Summer of Love]]).&lt;ref&gt;Unterberger R., Hicks S., Dempsey J, (1999). ''Music USA: The Rough Guide,'' Rough Guides Ltd; illustrated edition.({{ISBN|9781858284217}})&lt;/ref&gt; It became May's best-known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, "just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. Mike Dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline."&lt;ref name="techno.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Derrick May—The Secret of Techno |url=http://www.techno.de/mixmag/interviews/DerrickMay1.html |work=[[Mixmag]] |access-date=25 July 2012 |year=1997 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040214105200/http://www.techno.de/mixmag/interviews/DerrickMay1.html |archive-date=14 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to British DJ [[Mark Moore]], "Strings of Life" led London club-goers to accept house: "because most people hated house music and it was all rare groove and hip hop...I'd play 'Strings of Life' at the [[Mudd Club]] and clear the floor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brewster|2006|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|"Although it can now be heard in Detroit's leading clubs, the local area has shown a marked reluctance to get behind the music. It has been in clubs like the Powerplant (Chicago), The World (New York), The Hacienda (Manchester), Rock City (Nottingham), and Downbeat (Leeds) where the techno sound has found most support. Ironically, the only Detroit club which really championed the sound was a peripatetic party night called Visage, which unromantically shared its name with one of Britain's oldest new romantic groups".{{sfn|Cosgrove|1988a}} |group=Note }} By the late 1980s interest in house, acid house and techno escalated in the club scene and MDMA-fueled club-goers, who were faced with a 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. closing time in the UK, started to seek after-hours refuge at all-night warehouse parties. Within a year, in summer 1989, up to 25,000 people at a time were attending commercially organised underground parties called raves.&lt;ref name="Koskoff_44" /&gt;

Trance emerged from the [[rave scene]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1980s and developed further during the early 1990s in [[Germany]] before spreading throughout the rest of Europe, as a more melodic offshoot from [[techno]] and house.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} At the same time trance music was developing in Europe, the genre was also gathering a following in the [[India]]n state of [[Goa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.toucanmusic.co.uk/articles/trance.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225123623/http://www.toucanmusic.co.uk/articles/trance.php |archive-date=2017-02-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trance is mostly [[Instrumental music|instrumental]], although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the [[vocal trance]] subgenre, which has been described as "grand, soaring, and operatic" and "ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths".&lt;ref name="remixing guide"&gt;Hawkins, Erik (2004).

Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, [[Tech trance]] is a mixture of trance and techno, and [[Vocal trance]] "combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music".&lt;ref name="tranceexperience" /&gt; The [[dream trance]] genre originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by [[Robert Miles]].

[[AllMusic]] states on progressive trance: "the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place. Emphasizing the smoother sound of [[Eurodance]] or house (and occasionally more reminiscent of [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] than [[Basement Jaxx]]), Progressive Trance became the sound of the world's dance floors by the end of the millennium. Critics ridiculed its focus on predictable breakdowns and relative lack of skill to beat-mix, but progressive trance was caned by the hottest DJ."&lt;ref name="AMProgTrance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressive Trance|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/progressive-trance-ma0000011914|website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakbeat hardcore, jungle, drum and bass====
{{Main|Jungle music|Drum and bass|Breakbeat hardcore}}
{{See also|History of drum and bass|UK garage|Breakbeat|Breakcore}}
By the early 1990s, a style of music developed within the rave scene that had an identity distinct from American house and techno. This music, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] before it, combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or breakbeats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres, and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue, and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so-called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM). This subgenre was known as "hardcore" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo breakbeats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as "jungle [[techno]]", a genre influenced by Jack Smooth and Basement Records, and later just "jungle", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum &amp; bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.

By 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====Dubstep====
{{Main|Dubstep}}
Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with [[bass line]]s that contain prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of [[UK garage]], drawing on a lineage of related styles such as [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[dub reggae]], [[Jungle music|jungle]], [[broken beat]], and [[grime (music genre)|grime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 AllMusic – Dubstep] "Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;Reynolds, S.(2012),''Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture,'' Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 Jan 2012), pages&amp;nbsp;511–516, ({{ISBN|978-1-59376-407-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system]] party scene in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Reynolds /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ The Big Big Sound System Splashdown], [[New Musical Express]], 21 February 1981, {{ISSN|0028-6362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as [[B-side]]s of [[2-step garage]] single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's nightclub Plastic People, at the "Forward" night (sometimes stylised as FWD&gt;&gt;), which went on to be considered influential to the development of dubstep. The term "dubstep" in reference to a genre of music began to be used around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime (music genre)|grime]].&lt;ref&gt;IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ "Hatcha Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

====Trap music (EDM)====
{{Main|Trap music (EDM)}}
Trap music (EDM) originated from [[techno]], dub, and [[Dutch House]], but also from [[Southern hip hop]] in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This form of trap music can be simplified by these three features: "1/3 hip hop (tempo and song structure are similar, most tracks are usually between 70-110 bpm) – with vocals sometimes being pitched down, 1/3 dance music –  high-pitched Dutch synth work, Hardstyle sampling, as well as a plethora of trap remixes of popular EDM songs, and 1/3 dub (low-frequency focus and strong emphasis on repetitiveness throughout a song)".&lt;ref name="RunTheTrap"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://runthetrap.com/what-is-trap-music/|title=What is Trap Music? Trap Music Explained|website=Run The Trap|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the artist that popularized this genre, along with several others, would-be producers such as [[RL Grime]] with the tracks ''"Core"'' and ''"Scylla"'' released in 2014, [[Flosstradamus]] with their "''Hdynation Radio"'' album released in 2015 and [[Carnage (DJ)]] with his track ''"Turn Up"'' released in 2012.&lt;ref name="RunTheTrap" /&gt; Trap music in this connotation was characterized by "soulful synths, 808s, the pan flute, sharp snares and long, syrup-slurred vowels" which created dirty and aggressive beats resulting in "dark melodies"  Trap is now mainly used as remixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/what-the-hell-is-trap-music-and-why-is-dubstep-involved-2408170|title=What the Hell Is Trap Music (and Why Is Dubstep Involved)?|last=Haithcoat|first=Rebecca|date=2012-10-04|website=L.A. Weekly|access-date=2019-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RunTheTrap" /&gt;

==Terminology==
The earliest use of the term "electronic dance music" (EDM) was by English musician, producer, manager, and innovator [[Richard James Burgess]] in 1980, whose single "European Man" with his band [[Landscape (band)|Landscape]] used the term on the back of the single's record sleeve: "Electronic Dance Music... EDM; computer programmed to perfection for your listening pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/1816877-European-Man/images|title=Images for Landscape - European Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess is therefore known as having coined the term, as well as "[[New Romantic]]". In response to a question about being credited with coining the term New Romantic in an interview with ''The Electricity Club'', Burgess said: "Initially I was using three terms - Futurist, Electronic Dance Music (the Landscape singles have EDM printed on them) and New Romantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricityclub.co.uk/richard-james-burgess-interview/|title=RICHARD JAMES BURGESS Interview|date=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aimpsummit2019.sched.com/speaker/richard_burgess.1zkp1h7s|title=Richard James Burgess's schedule for 2019 AIMP Indie Music Publishing Summit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundexchange.com/about/our-team/board-of-directors/richard-james-burgess/|title=Richard James Burgess|website=SoundExchange}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the term was used as early as 1985, although the term "dance music" did not catch on as a blanket term.&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US "rave culture" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, "dance music" or "dance" are more common terms for EDM.&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; What is widely perceived to be "club music" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, "electronic dance music" can mean different things to different people. Both "club music" and "EDM" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Though ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' debuted a "dance" chart in 1974, the larger US music industry did not create music charts until the late 1990s.&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the "Electronic Dance Music Awards".&lt;sup&gt;[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]

Electronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s, the use of [[software]] has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW), with various [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a [[MIDI keyboard]]. This setup is generally sufficient to complete entire productions, which are then ready for [[audio mastering|mastering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Richard James|title=The History of Music Production|date=2014|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0199357161|pages=136–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bedroom production ===
A [[Bedroom Production|bedroom producer]] is an independent musician who creates electronic music on their laptop or in a home studio. Unlike in traditional recording studios, bedroom producers typically use low-cost, accessible software and equipment which can lead to music being created completely "in the box," with no external hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walzer|first=Daniel A.|date=2016-10-25|title=Independent music production: how individuality, technology and creative entrepreneurship influence contemporary music industry practices|journal=Creative Industries Journal|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1080/17510694.2016.1247626|s2cid=151981731|issn=1751-0694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the popularization of electronic dance music was associated with European rave and club culture and it achieved limited popular exposure in America. By the mid-to-late 1990s this began to change as the American music industry made efforts to market a range of dance genres as "[[electronica]]".&lt;ref name=sisario&gt;{{cite news| author1 =Ben Sisario |title=Electronic Dance Concerts Turn Up Volume, Tempting Investors|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/business/media/electronic-dance-genre-tempts-investors.html| work=The New York Times |date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, a wave of electronic music bands from the UK, including [[The Prodigy]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Fatboy Slim]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], had been prematurely associated with an "American electronica revolution".&lt;ref name=Spin&gt;Sherburne, Philip.

With the increasing popularity of electronic dance music, [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]] and venues realized that DJs could generate larger profits than traditional musicians; [[Diplo]] explained that "a band plays [for] 45 minutes; DJs can play for four hours. Rock bands—there's a few headliner dudes that can play 3,000–4,000-capacity venues, but DJs play the same venues, they turn the crowd over two times, people buy drinks all night long at higher prices—it's a win-win."&lt;ref name=Spin /&gt; Electronic music festivals, such as [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] (EDC) in [[Las Vegas]] and [[Ultra Music Festival]] in [[Miami]] also grew in size, placing an increased emphasis on visual experiences, and DJs who had begun to attain a celebrity status.&lt;ref name=guardian-conquered/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/&gt; Other major acts that gained prominence, including [[Avicii]] and [[Swedish House Mafia]], toured major venues such as [[arena]]s and stadiums rather than playing clubs; in December 2011, Swedish House Mafia became the first electronic music act to sell out [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/&gt;

In 2011, ''Spin'' declared a "new rave generation" led by acts like David Guetta, [[Deadmau5]], and [[Skrillex]].&lt;ref name="Spin" /&gt; In January 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced a new EDM-focused [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart, tracking the top 50 electronic songs based on sales, radio airplay, club play, and online [[Streaming media|streaming]].&lt;ref name="billboard-deschart"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Dance/Electronic Songs Chart Launches With Will.i.am &amp; Britney at No. 1|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1510640/new-danceelectronic-songs-chart-launches-with-william-britney-at-no-1|website=Billboard|access-date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eventbrite, EDM fans are more likely to use social media to discover and share events or gigs.

====US corporate interest====

Sillerman]]—founder of what is now [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]]—re-launched [[SFX Entertainment]] as an EDM conglomerate, and announced his plan to invest $1 billion to acquire EDM businesses. His acquisitions included regional promoters and festivals (including [[ID&amp;T]], which organises [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]]), two nightclub operators in [[Miami]], and [[Beatport]], an [[online music store]] which focuses on electronic music.&lt;ref name=billboard-voodoo&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: SFX Acquires ID&amp;T, Voodoo Experience |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1521628/exclusive-sfx-acquires-idt-voodoo-experience| work =Billboard|access-date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-sfx&gt;{{cite news |title=SFX Purchases 75% Stake in ID&amp;T, Announce U.S. Edition of Tomorrowland at Ultra |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1553846/sfx-purchases-75-stake-in-idt-announce-us-edition-of-tomorrowland-at-ultra | work =Billboard |access-date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live Nation also acquired [[Creamfields|Cream Holdings]] and [[Hard Events]], and announced a "creative partnership" with EDC organizers [[Insomniac Events]] in 2013 that would allow it to access its resources whilst remaining an independent company;&lt;ref name=billboard-lnsomniac&gt;{{cite news |author = Zel McCarthy |title=Live Nation Teams With Insomniac Events in 'Creative Partnership'| url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1567396/live-nation-teams-with-insomniac-events-in-creative-partnership|work= Billboard | date=June 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino described EDM as the "[new] [[rock 'n' roll]]".&lt;ref name=sisario/&gt;&lt;ref name=spin-hardacquired&gt;{{cite news |title=Live Nation Acquires L.A.

US [[radio]] conglomerate [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] (formerly Clear Channel Media and Entertainment) also made efforts to align itself with EDM.

Major brands have also used the EDM phenomena as a means of targeting [[millennials]]&lt;ref name=adage-7x7up/&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-tmobileedm/&gt; and EDM songs and artists have increasingly been featured in television commercials and programs.&lt;ref name=herald-booming&gt;{{cite news|title=Booming business: EDM goes mainstream |url= http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/03/26/4020841/booming-business.html |date=March 26, 2014| work =Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicii's manager Ash Pournouri compared these practices to the commercialization of [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=herald-booming/&gt; [[Heineken]] has a marketing relationship with the Ultra Music Festival, and has incorporated Dutch producers [[Armin van Buuren]] and Tiësto into its ad campaigns.

Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella felt that the industry would weather the financial uncertainty of the overall market by focusing on "innovation" and entering into new markets.&lt;ref name=forbes-edmbubble&gt;{{cite web|title=The $6.9 Billion Bubble?

In 2020 LiveStyle entered its final phase of restoring the original owners of the companies acquired during the SFX reign or selling them. Northeast EDM promotor React Presents was sold to LiveXLive and Donnie bought his company, Disco Donnie Presents, back from LiveStyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.pvrpmusic.com/music-marketing-trends-february-2020/|title=Music Marketing Trends February 2020|last=Peery|first=Randall|date=February 2020|access-date=2020-04-25|via=pvrpmusic.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of over-commercialization====
Following the popularization of EDM in America a number of producers and DJs, including [[Carl Cox]], [[Steve Lawler]], and [[Markus Schulz]], raised concerns that the perceived over-commercialisation of dance music had impacted the "art" of DJing. Cox saw the "press-play" approach taken by newer EDM DJs as unrepresentative of what he called a "DJ ethos".&lt;ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/&gt; Writing in ''[[Mixmag]]'', DJ Tim Sheridan argued that "push-button DJs" who use auto-sync and play pre-recorded sets of "obvious hits" resulted in a situation overtaken by "the spectacle, money and the showbiz".&lt;ref name="mixmag-killing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is EDM killing the art of DJing? |url=http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/is-edm-killing-the-art-of-djing |work=Mixmag |access-date=7 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529084448/http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/is-edm-killing-the-art-of-djing |archive-date=29 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some house producers openly admitted that "commercial" EDM needed further differentiation and creativity. Avicii, whose 2013 album [[True (Avicii album)|''True'']] featured songs incorporating elements of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], such as lead single "[[Wake Me Up (Avicii song)|Wake Me Up]]", stated that most EDM lacked "longevity".&lt;ref name=mixmag-bored&gt;{{cite news|title=EDM Will Eat Itself: Big Room stars are getting bored|url=http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/edm-will-eat-itself-big-room-stars-are-getting-bored|work=Mixmag|access-date=20 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118085704/http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/edm-will-eat-itself-big-room-stars-are-getting-bored|archive-date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadmau5 criticized the [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] of popular EDM, and suggested that it "all sounds the same". During the 2014 Ultra Music Festival, Deadmau5 made critical comments about up-and-coming EDM artist [[Martin Garrix]] and later played an edited version of Garrix's "[[Animals (Martin Garrix song)|Animals]]" remixed to the melody of "[[Old McDonald Had a Farm]]". Afterwards, [[Tiësto]] criticized Deadmau5 on [[Twitter]] for "sarcastically" mixing Avicii's "[[Levels (Avicii song)|Levels]]" with his own "[[Ghosts 'n' Stuff]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Deadmau5 Trolls Martin Garrix with 'Old MacDonald Had a Farm' Remix of 'Animals' at Ultra|url= http://radio.com/2014/03/31/deadmau5-trolls-martin-garrix-with-old-macdonald-had-a-farm-remix-of-animals-at-ultra|work= radio.com|date= March 31, 2014|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140428174220/http://radio.com/2014/03/31/deadmau5-trolls-martin-garrix-with-old-macdonald-had-a-farm-remix-of-animals-at-ultra/|archive-date= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mixmag-soundsthesame&gt;{{cite news |title=Deadmau5 gives reason for techno track: "EDM sounds the same to me"|url = http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/57693/Deadmau5_talks_making_techno_EDM_all_sounds_the_same_to_me |work= Mixmag   |access-date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mixmag-trolled&gt;{{cite news|title=Deadmau5: The Man Who Trolled the World |url=http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/deadmau5/man-who-trolled-the-world |work=Mixmag |access-date=25 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425040816/http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/deadmau5/man-who-trolled-the-world |archive-date=25 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mixmag-afrojackfight&gt;{{cite news| title=Afrojack and Deadmau5 argue over what's "good music"| url=http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/afrojack-and-deadmau5-argue-over-whats-good-music| work=Mixmag| access-date=20 January 2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234411/http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/afrojack-and-deadmau5-argue-over-whats-good-music| archive-date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' parodied the stereotypes of EDM culture and push-button DJs in a [[SNL Digital Short|Digital Short]] entitled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUV7Q1C1SU "When Will the Bass Drop?"].

After years of rapid growth, the American popular EDM market started to wane in 2016 when a number of artists famous for producing so-called 'big room' electro-house started to diversify stylistically.

In May 2015, the [[International Music Summit]]'s Business Report estimated that the global electronic music industry had reached nearly $6.9 billion in value; the count included music sales, events revenue (including nightclubs and festivals), the sale of DJ equipment and software, and other sources of revenue. The report also identified several emerging markets for electronic dance music, including [[East Asia]], [[India]], and [[South Africa]], credited primarily to investment by domestic, as well as American and European interests. A number of major festivals also began expanding into [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=thump-edmworldwide&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Music Industry Now Worth Close to $7 Billion Amid Slowing Growth|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/electronic-music-industry-now-worth-close-to-7-billion-amid-slowing-growth|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|access-date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ethiopia]] EDM has become part of mainstream music after the 2018 breakthrough of a young artist named [[Rophnan]] which incorporated EDM sound with traditional rhythms and melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbesafrica.com/30-under-30/2019/07/01/30under30-creatives-category-2019/|title=#30Under30: Creatives Category 2019|last=Mwendera|first=Karen|date=July 1, 2019|website=Forbes Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his shows, tens of thousands of youth were packing stadiums across the country and radios started to play the emerging genre.&lt;ref name=":raregenre"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://addisfortune.net/addisfortunefeature/rophnan-roots-with-rare-genre/|title=Rophnan: Roots with Rare Genre|website=Addis Fortune|access-date=July 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/rophnan-shines-leza-awards-night|title=Rophnan shines at Leza Awards night &amp;#124; The Reporter Ethiopia English|website=www.thereporterethiopia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] is a market where EDM had initially made relatively few inroads; although promoters believed that the mostly instrumental music would remove a metaphorical [[language barrier]], the growth of EDM in China was hampered by the lack of a prominent rave culture in the country as in other regions, as well as the popularity of domestic [[C-pop|Chinese pop]] over foreign artists. Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s "Lose Myself". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's "hands-on" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in "encouraging" the growth of EDM in the country.&lt;ref name=wsj-china&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thump-chinapopoff&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|access-date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, electronic dance music was often played at illegal underground rave parties held in secret locations, for example, warehouses, abandoned aircraft hangars, fields and any other large, open areas. In the 1990s and 2000s, aspects of the underground [[rave]] culture of the 1980s and early 1990s began to evolve into legitimate, organized EDM concerts and [[music festivals|festival]]s. Major festivals often feature a large number of acts representing various EDM genres spread across multiple stages. Festivals have placed a larger emphasis on visual spectacles as part of their overall experiences, including elaborate stage designs with underlying thematics, complex lighting systems, [[laser show]]s, and [[pyrotechnics]]. [[Rave#Attire|Rave fashion]] also evolved among attendees, which ''[[The Guardian]]'' described as progressing from the 1990s "kandi raver" to "[a] slick and sexified yet also kitschy-surreal image midway between [[Venice Beach]] and [[Cirque du Soleil]], [[Willy Wonka]] and a [[Pride parade|gay pride parade]]".&lt;ref name=guardian-conquered/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/&gt;&lt;ref name=da-edclv&gt;{{cite news |title=An Electric Desert Experience: The 2014 EDC Las Vegas Phenomenon |url= http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2014/06/edc |author = Valerie Lee | date = June 27, 2014 | work =Dancing Astronaut }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events differed from underground raves by their organized nature, often taking place at major venues, and measures to ensure the health and safety of attendees.&lt;ref name=lat-fataltoll&gt;{{cite news |title=A fatal toll on concertgoers as raves boost cities' income| url= http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-coliseum-rave-deaths-20130203-story.html#page=1| work =Los Angeles Times |date = February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]]'s Rawley Bornstein described electronic music as "the new rock and roll",&lt;ref name=mainstream&gt;Lisa Rose, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/new_jersey_basks_in_the_summer.html "N.J. basks in the glow of the brave new rave: Electronic dance festivals go mainstream"], ''Newark Star Ledger'', May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; as has Lollapalooza organizer Perry Ferrell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Sarah Maloy |title=Lollapalooza's Perry Farrell on EDM and Elevating the Aftershow: Video |url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/480607/lollapaloozas-perry-farrell-on-edm-and-elevating-the| work =Billboard | date= August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They often play EDM-specific stages, but major acts such as [[Deadmau5]] and [[Calvin Harris]] have made overall headlining appearances on the main stages of Lollapalooza and Coachella respectively—placements that are typically associated with [[rock music|rock]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]].&lt;ref name="noisey-chicago"&gt;{{cite news |title=House Music Comes Home: How Chicago's Summer of Music Festivals Has Reinvigorated the City's Dance Spirit |url =http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/house-music-comes-home-how-chicagos-summer-of-music-festivals-has-reinvigorated-the-citys-dance-spirit | work = Noisey| publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lvweekly-edmfeverpitch"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Coachella's final day symbolizes the electronic music fever pitch| url= http://www.lvweekly.com/ae/music/2014/apr/14/how-coachellas-final-day-symbolizes-electronic-mus | work = Las Vegas Weekly |date =April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Russell Smith (writer)|Russell Smith]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' felt that the commercial festival industry was an antithesis to the original principles of the rave subculture, citing "the expensive tickets, the giant corporate sponsors, the crass [[Bro (subculture)|bro culture]]—shirtless muscle boys who cruise the stadiums, tiny popular girls in bikinis who ride on their shoulders – not to mention the sappy music itself."&lt;ref name=gandm-exposes&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Smith: Exposés on EDM festivals shift long overdue blame|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/exposes-on-electronic-dance-music-festivals/article25415136/|access-date=3 October 2015|work=The Globe and Mail|date=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug-related incidents, as well as other complaints surrounding the behaviour of their attendees, have contributed to negative perceptions and opposition to electronic music events by local authorities;&lt;ref name=gandm-exposes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-musicsafety&gt;{{cite news|title=Music festival safety recommendations come too late for family|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/music-festival-safety-recommendations-come-too-late-for-family-1.3129576|access-date=3 October 2015|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash Jenkins|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly with a wide range of drugs that have been categorized under the name "[[club drug]]s". Russell Smith noted that the association of drugs and music subcultures was by no means exclusive to electronic music, citing previous examples of music genres that were associated with certain drugs, such as [[psychedelic rock]] and [[LSD]], [[disco music]] and [[cocaine]], and [[punk music]] and [[heroin]].&lt;ref name=gandm-exposes/&gt;
[[File:Ecstasy monogram.jpg|thumb|Pictured above is what the drug ecstasy commonly looks like, though there are many different shapes and forms.]]
[[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine]] (MDMA), also known as ecstasy, "E", or "Molly", is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and [[house party|house parties]].&lt;ref name="pmid22392347"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carvalho M, Carmo H, Costa VM, Capela JP, Pontes H, Remião F, Carvalho F, Bastos Mde L | title = Toxicity of amphetamines: an update | journal = Arch. Toxicol. | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1167–1231 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22392347 | doi = 10.1007/s00204-012-0815-5 | s2cid = 2873101 | quote = MDMA has become a popular recreational drug of abuse at nightclubs and rave or techno parties, where it is combined with intense physical activity (''all-night dancing''), crowded conditions (aggregation), high ambient temperature, poor hydration, loud noise, and is commonly taken together with other stimulant ''club drugs'' and/or alcohol (Parrott 2006; Von Huben et al. 2007; Walubo and Seger 1999). This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&amp;nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the "rave" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&amp;q=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA&amp;pg=PA81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drug [[para-Methoxyamphetamine]] (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, "Death" or "Dr. Death", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure. People who take PMA are often mistaken for it being identified as MDMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning over fake ecstasy tablets after seven people die in Scotland|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/10/fake-ecstasy-warning-die-scotland|work=The Guardian|first=Caroline|last=Davies|access-date=10 July 2013|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PMA: 'Not just another drug scare story'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jul/22/pma-not-another-drug-scare-story|work=The Guardian|first=Emine|last=Saner|date=22 July 2013|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDMA is occasionally known for being taken in conjunction with psychedelic drugs. The more common combinations include MDMA combined with [[LSD]], MDMA combined with [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], MDMA with [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and MDMA with the disassociative drug [[ketamine]]. Many users use [[menthol]]ated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation while experiencing the drug's effects. Examples include menthol cigarettes, [[Vicks VapoRub]], [[NyQuil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse |publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=May 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826051026/http://drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |archive-date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[throat lozenge|lozenges]].

====Drug-related deaths at electronic dance music events====
A number of deaths attributed to apparent drug use have occurred at major electronic music concerts and festivals.

In September 2016, the city of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] banned all electronic music events, pending future legislation, after five drug-related deaths and four injuries at a [[Time Warp Festival]] event in the city in April 2016. The ban forced electronic band [[Kraftwerk]] to cancel a planned concert in the city, despite arguing that there were dissimilarities between a festival and their concerts.&lt;ref name="billboard-kraftwerkban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kraftwerk Can't Play Buenos Aires Concert Due to Electronic Music Ban: Report|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7573336/buenos-aires-kraftwerk-concert-electronic-music-ban|website=Billboard|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-buenosairesban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buenos Aires bans electronic music festivals after five deaths|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/buenos-aires-bans-electronic-music-festivals-after-five-deaths|website=The Guardian|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
