The '''global warming controversy''' concerns the public debate over whether [[global warming]] is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its [[Effects of global warming|effects]] will be, whether any action can or should be taken to curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the [[scientific literature]], there is a [[Scientific consensus on climate change|strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased]] in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCG-20140411" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD-201404" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf |title='Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.'

The controversy is, by now, political rather than scientific: there is a scientific consensus that global warming is happening and is caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ |title=Scientific consensus: Earth's climate is warming |website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet |access-date=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the [[Media coverage of climate change|media]] than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the [[United States]] than [[Climate change opinion by country|globally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=M. |first2=J. |title=Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press |last1=Boykoff |journal=Global Environmental Change Part A |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |date=July 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001 |last2=Boykoff |url=http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106081048/http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf |archive-date= 6 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merchants_doubt"&gt;{{cite book | title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming | first1=Naomi | last1=Oreskes | author-link1=Naomi Oreskes | first2=Erik | last2=Conway | publisher=Bloomsbury Press | edition=first | isbn=978-1-59691-610-4 | date=2010 | url=https://archive.org/details/merchantsofdoubt00ores }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and popular debate concerning the existence and cause of global warming includes the reasons for the increase seen in the [[instrumental temperature record]], whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether [[attribution of recent climate change|human activities have contributed significantly to it]]. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favour of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years and National Research Council|title=Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years|year=2006|publisher=The National Academies|location=Washington, DC|doi=10.17226/11676|isbn=978-0-309-10225-4|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&amp;page=R1|access-date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases ([[climate sensitivity]]), how the climate will change at local and regional scales, and what the [[Effects of global warming|consequences of global warming]] will be.

Global warming remains an issue of widespread political debate, often split along party political lines, especially in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Support for Climate and Energy Policies in March 2012|year=2012|publisher=Yale Project on Climate Change Communication|url=http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Policy-Support-March-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the issues that are settled within the scientific community, such as human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them—an ideological phenomenon categorised by academics and scientists as [[climate change denial]]. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science opposing mainstream scientific positions have been questioned. There are debates about the best [[Climate change mitigation|policy responses to the science]], their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported [[Politicization of science#Global warming|government and oil-industry pressure]] to [[Climate change denial|censor or suppress their work]] and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it have reached American courts. The [[fossil fuels lobby]] has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.&lt;ref name=Vidal /&gt;

== History ==

=== Public opinion ===
{{Main|Public opinion on global warming}}
In the [[United States]], the mass media devoted little coverage to global warming until the [[drought]] of 1988, and [[James E. Hansen]]'s testimony to the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which explicitly attributed "the abnormally hot weather plaguing our nation" to global warming. Global warming in the U.S., gained more attention after the release of the documentary  [[An Inconvenient Truth]], featuring [[Al Gore]] in 2006.&lt;ref name = "McCrightDunlap2000p500"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCright, A. M. |author2=Dunlap R. E. |title=Challenging global warming as a social problem: An analysis of the conservative movement's counter-claims |journal=Social Problems |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=499–522 |year=2000 |jstor=3097132 |url=http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/McCright_Challenging%20Global%20Warming.pdf |doi=10.2307/3097132 }} See p.&amp;nbsp;500.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The British press also changed its coverage at the end of 1988, following a speech by [[Margaret Thatcher]] to the [[Royal Society]] advocating action against human-induced climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Speech to the Royal Society (27 September 1988), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107346 Public Statement, Speech Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved 9 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anabela Carvalho, an academic analyst, Thatcher's "appropriation" of the risks of climate change to promote [[nuclear power]], in the context of the dismantling of the coal industry following the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|1984–1985 miners' strike]] was one reason for the change in public discourse. At the same time environmental organizations and the political opposition were demanding "solutions that contrasted with the government's".&lt;ref name="Carvalho2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carvalho, Anabela |title=Ideological cultures and media discourses on scientific knowledge |journal=Public Understanding of Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=223–43 |year=2007 |doi=10.1177/0963662506066775 |hdl=1822/41838 |s2cid=220837080 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00571102/file/PEER_stage2_10.1177%252F0963662506066775.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] took a strong stance criticising both climate change deniers and corporate lobbyists by likening the Earth to a dying patient. "A scientific hypothesis is tested to absolute destruction, but medicine can't wait. If a doctor sees a child with a fever, he can't wait for [endless] tests. He has to act on what is there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/09/prince-charles-climate-change | title=Charles: 'Climate change sceptics are turning Earth into dying patient' | newspaper=The Guardian | date=9 May 2013 | last=Harvey | first=Fiona | access-date= 10 May 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European countries took action to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] before 1990. [[West Germany]] started to take action after the [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]] took seats in Parliament in the 1980s. All countries of the [[European Union]] ratified the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Substantial activity by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s took place as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/confrontingclima0000mint/page/265 265–272]|title=Confronting climate change|first=Irving M.|last=Mintzer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-521-42091-4|url=https://archive.org/details/confrontingclima0000mint/page/265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Energy Information Administration|United States Energy Information Administration]] reports that, in the United States, "The 2012 downturn means that emissions are at their lowest level since 1994 and over 12% below the recent 2007 peak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USEIA U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2012|date=21 October 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that increases in greenhouse gases would lead to an increase in temperature was first proposed by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1896, but climate change did not arise  as a political issue until the 1990s. It took many years for this particular issue to attract any type of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bodansky|first1=Daniel|editor1-last=Luterbacher|editor1-first=Urs|editor2-last=Sprinz|editor2-first=Detlef F.|title=International Relations and Global Climate Change|date=2001|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|pages=23–40|chapter-url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/shared/iheid/800/luterbacher/luterbacher%20chapter%202%20102.pdf|access-date=22 November 2016|chapter=The History of the Global Climate Change Regime|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327080814/http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/shared/iheid/800/luterbacher/luterbacher%20chapter%202%20102.pdf|archive-date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the notion of human influence on climate gained wide acceptance more rapidly than in the United States and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|first=Thomas|last=Crampton|date=4 January 2007|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/04/news/poll.php|access-date=14 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Consensus on Global Warming – Partisanship Drives Opinion – Summary of Findings|publisher=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|date=12 July 2006|access-date=14 April 2007|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey found that Europeans rated climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world, between "poverty, the lack of food and drinking water" and "a major global economic downturn". 87% of Europeans considered climate change to be a very serious or serious problem, while ten per cent did not consider it a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TNS Opinion and Social|title=Europeans' Attitudes Towards Climate Change|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_322_en.pdf|format=Full free text|publisher=European Commission|date=December 2009|access-date=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[BBC]] announced the cancellation of a planned television special [[Planet Relief]], which would have highlighted the global warming issue and included a mass electrical switch-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Richard|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6979596.stm|title=BBC switches off climate special|work=BBC|date=5 September 2007|access-date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of BBC's [[Newsnight]] current affairs show said: "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I think there are a lot of people who think that, but it must be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/05/bbc.television2 BBC drops climate change special]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 5 September 2007. Retrieved 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Mark Lynas]] said "The only reason why this became an issue is that there is a small but vociferous group of extreme right-wing climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance."&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Michael, [http://environment.independent.co.uk/climate_change/article2934318.ece Global Warming: Too Hot to Handle for the BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915053005/http://environment.independent.co.uk/climate_change/article2934318.ece |date=15 September 2007 }}, ''The Independent'', 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the 2010 book ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]'', provide documentation for the assertion that professional deniers have tried to sow seeds of doubt in public opinion in order to halt any meaningful social or political progress to reduce the impact of human carbon emissions. The fact that only half of the American population believes global warming is caused by human activity could be seen as a victory for these deniers.&lt;ref name="merchants_doubt"/&gt; One of the authors' main arguments is that most prominent scientists who have been voicing opposition to the near-universal consensus are being funded by industries, such as automotive and oil, that stand to lose money by government actions to regulate [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merchants of doubt : how a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming|author=Oreskes, Naomi|date=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|others=Conway, Erik M.|isbn=978-1596916104|edition=1st US|location=New York|oclc=461631066|url=https://archive.org/details/merchantsofdoubt00ores}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a report on public perceptions in the [[United Kingdom]] by Ipsos MORI&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/DownloadPublication/1174_sri_tipping_point_or_turning_point_climate_change.pdf Tipping Point or Turning Point? Social Marketing &amp; Climate Change (3Mb pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215022356/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/DownloadPublication/1174_sri_tipping_point_or_turning_point_climate_change.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}, by Ipsos Mori, July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that

* There is widespread recognition that the climate, irrespective of the cause, is changing—88% believe this to be true.
* However, the public is out of step with the scientific community, with 41% believing that climate change is being caused by both human activity and natural processes. 46% believe human activity is the main cause.
* Only a small minority reject anthropogenic climate change, while almost half (44%) are very concerned. However, there remains a large proportion who are not fully persuaded and hold doubts about the extent of the threat.
* There is still a strong appetite among the public for more information, and 63% say they need this to come to a firm view on the issue and what it means for them.
* The public continue to externalize climate change to other people, places and times. It is increasingly perceived as a major global issue with far-reaching consequences for future generations—45% say it is the most serious threat facing the World today and 53% believe it will impact significantly on future generations. However, the issue features less prominently nationally and locally, indeed only 9% believe climate change will have a significant impact upon them personally.

The [[Canadians|Canadian]] science [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] activist [[David Suzuki]] reports that focus groups organized by the [[David Suzuki Foundation]] in 2006 showed that the public has a poor understanding of the science behind global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/about_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Article_Archives/weekly08180601.asp|title=Public doesn't understand global warming|author=David Suzuki|publisher=David Suzuki Foundation|date=18 August 2006|access-date=18 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816174336/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/about_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Article_Archives/weekly08180601.asp|archive-date=16 August 2007|url-status=dead|author-link=David Suzuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite publicity through different means, including the films ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and ''[[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|The 11th Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://11thhourfilm.com/|title=11th Hour Film|access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd|title=An Inconvenient Truth (Movie)|website=Al Gore|access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-nation poll conducted in 2006, by [[Pew Research Center|Pew Global]] found that there "is a substantial gap in concern over global warming—roughly two-thirds of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (66%) and Indians (65%) say they personally worry a great deal about global warming. Roughly half of the populations of Spain (51%) and France (46%) also express great concern over global warming, based on those who have heard about the issue. But there is no evidence of alarm over global warming in either the [[United States]] or [[China]]—the two largest producers of greenhouse gases. Just 19% of Americans and 20% of the Chinese who have heard of the issue say they worry a lot about global warming—the lowest percentages in the 15 countries surveyed. Moreover, nearly half of Americans (47%) and somewhat fewer Chinese (37%) express little or no concern about the problem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/252.pdf No Global Warming Alarm in the U.S., China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201022704/http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/252.pdf |date=1 December 2007 }} 15-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, released 13 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the critics of the consensus view on global warming have disagreed, in whole or part, with the scientific consensus regarding other issues, particularly those relating to environmental risks, such as [[ozone depletion]], [[DDT#Environmental impact|DDT]], and [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental skepticism: ecology, power and public life|series=Global environmental governance series|author=Peter Jacques|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=George E.

Mooney says that the promotion of doubt regarding issues that are politically, but not scientifically, controversial became increasingly prevalent under the George W. Bush administration, which, he says, regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims. This is also the subject of a 2004 book by environmental lawyer [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]] titled ''Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and Corporate Pals are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy'' ({{ISBN|978-0060746872}}). Another book on this topic is ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'' by former [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|Vice President of the United States]] [[Al Gore]]. ''The Heat Is On'' by [[Ross Gelbspan]] chronicles how Congress tied climate change denial to attacks on the scientific bases for ozone depletion and asbestos removal, among other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gelbspan |first=Ross |title=The Heat is On |year=1998 |isbn=978-0738200255 |publisher=Basic Books |edition=updated |chapter=A Congressional Book Burning |pages=63{{hyphen}}83 |quote-page=64 |quote=Congress's attack on the scientific evidence for planetary warming was preceded by a House subcommittee's attack on the scientific evidence for ozone depletion....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific consensus ===
{{also|Scientific consensus on climate change}}
[[Scientific consensus]] is normally achieved through communication at conferences, publication in the [[scientific literature]], replication (reproducible results by others), and [[peer review]]. In the case of global warming, many governmental reports, the media in many countries, and environmental groups, have stated that there is virtually unanimous [[scientific consensus|scientific agreement]] that human-caused global warming is real and poses a serious concern.&lt;ref name=1997_Call_for_Action&gt;

In 2014, a letter from 52 leading skeptics was published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry supporting the scientific consensus and asking the media to stop referring to deniers as "skeptics." The letter clarified the skeptical opinion on climate and denial: "As scientific skeptics, we are well aware of political efforts to undermine climate science by those who deny reality but do not engage in scientific research or consider evidence that their deeply held opinions are wrong. The most appropriate word to describe the behavior of those individuals is 'denial'. Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics. By perpetrating this misnomer, journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| url=http://www.csicop.org/news/show/deniers_are_not_skeptics | title=Deniers are not Skeptics | year=2014| magazine=Skeptical Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We recognise IPCC as the world's most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus. Despite increasing consensus on the science underpinning predictions of global climate change, doubts have been expressed recently about the need to mitigate the risks posed by global climate change. We do not consider such doubts justified."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead author of the key chapter on detection and attribution...was a scientist of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory named Benjamin J. Santer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the IPCC report came out, [[Frederick Seitz|Seitz]], [[William Nierenberg|Nierenberg]], and now a 4th physicist—a man by the name of [[Fred Singer|S. Fred Singer]]—launched a highly personal attack on Santer. In an open letter to the IPCC, which they sent to numerous members of the US Congress, Singer, Seitz, and Nierenberg accused Santer of making "unauthorized" changes to the IPCC report [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They followed this with an op-ed piece in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' titled "A Major Deception on Global Warming". This piece was written by Seitz, in which he states that the effect of the changes was "to deceive policy makers and the public".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Santer replied, in a letter to the editor of ''The Wall Street Journal'', and in the response he explained that he had made changes, but those changes were in response to the peer review process. In other words, totally normal scientific practice...This account was corroborated by the Chairman of the IPCC and by all of the other authors of the chapters. In fact, over 40 scientists were co-authors of this chapter. This letter was signed by Santer and 40 others and published in ''The Wall Street Journal'' in June 1996. And Santer was also formally defended by the American Meteorological Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither Seitz nor Singer ever retracted the charges, which was then repeated—many times, over and over again—by industry groups and think-tanks. And in fact, if you google "Ben Santer", these same charges are still in the Internet today. In fact, one site said that it was ''proven'' in 1996 that Santer had fraudulently altered the IPCC report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Synthesis and Executive summaries; the full reports attract less attention. Some of the controversy and criticism has originated from experts invited by the IPCC to submit reports or serve on its panels.

[[Christopher Landsea]], a hurricane researcher, said of "the part of the IPCC to which my expertise is relevant" that "I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoisier.com.au/papers/articles/landsea.html|title=An Open Letter to the Community from Chris Landsea|access-date=28 April 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218131946/http://www.lavoisier.com.au/papers/articles/landsea.html| archive-date = 18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of comments made at a press conference by [[Kevin Trenberth]] of which Landsea disapproved.

In 2005, the [[House of Lords]] Economics Committee wrote, "We have some concerns about the objectivity of the IPCC process, with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations."

While some critics have argued that the IPCC overstates likely global warming, others have made the opposite criticism. David Biello, writing in the [[Scientific American]], argues that, because of the need to secure consensus among governmental representatives, the IPCC reports give conservative estimates of the likely extent and effects of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0407-16 |author=Biello D |title=Conservative Climate |journal=Scientific American |date=April 2007 |pmid=17479619 |volume=296 |issue=4 |pages=16–19 |bibcode=2007SciAm.296d..16B }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' editor Brooks Hanson states in a 2010 editorial: "The IPCC reports have underestimated the pace of climate change while overestimating societies' abilities to curb greenhouse gas emissions."&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stepping Back; Moving Forward|last=Hanson|first=Brooks|date=7 May 2010|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=328|issue=5979|pages=667|doi=10.1126/science.1190790|pmid=20448154|bibcode=2010Sci...328..667H|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate scientist [[James E.

Pielke Sr. has also stated "Humans are significantly altering the global climate, but in a variety of diverse ways beyond the radiative effect of carbon dioxide. The IPCC assessments have been too conservative in recognizing the importance of these human climate forcings as they alter regional and global climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climatesci.org/main-conclusions/|title=Climate Science: Main Conclusions|access-date=11 December 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081211205600/http://climatesci.org/main-conclusions/ |archive-date= 11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann Henderson-Sellers|Henderson-Sellers]] has collected comments from IPCC authors in a 2007 workshop revealing a number of concerns. She concluded, "Climate change research entered a new and different regime with the publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.

=== Greenhouse gases ===
[[Attribution of recent climate change]] discusses the evidence for recent [[global warming]]. Nonetheless, one argument against global warming says that rising levels of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) and other [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) do not correlate with global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=XiuMing |last1=Liu |first2=JiaSheng |last2=Chen |title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; seasonal variation and global change: Test global warming from another point of view |journal=Sciences in Cold and Arid Regions |year=2017 |volume=9 |number=1 |pages=46–53 |doi=10.3724/SP.J.1226.2017.00046 |doi-broken-date=31 May 2021 |url=http://www.scar.ac.cn/EN/10.3724/SP.J.1226.2017.00046 |access-date=2020-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Studies of the Vostok [[ice core]] show that at the "beginning of the deglaciations, the {{CO2}} increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations".&lt;ref&gt;

Analysis of carbon isotopes in atmospheric {{CO2}} shows that the recent observed {{CO2}} increase cannot have come from the oceans, volcanoes, or the biosphere, and thus is not a response to rising temperatures as would be required if the same processes creating past lags were active now.&lt;ref&gt;

like many other reports, notes the past correlation between {{CO2}} emissions and economic growth and then extrapolates using a "business as usual" scenario to predict GDP growth and hence {{CO2}} levels, concluding that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Increasing scarcity of fossil fuels alone will not stop emissions growth in time. The stocks of hydrocarbons that are profitable to extract are more than enough to take the world to levels of {{CO2}} well beyond 750 ppm with very dangerous consequences for climate change impacts.

Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming express varied opinions concerning the cause of global warming. Some say only that it has not yet been ascertained whether humans are the primary cause of global warming; others attribute global warming to natural variation; [[ocean current]]s; increased [[solar variation|solar activity]] or [[cosmic ray]]s. The consensus position is that solar radiation may have increased by 0.12&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since 1750, compared to 1.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the net anthropogenic forcing.&lt;ref name="4ARSPM"&gt;

A few studies say that the present level of solar activity is historically high as determined by sunspot activity and other factors. Solar activity could affect climate either by variation in the Sun's output or, more speculatively, by an indirect effect on the amount of [[Solar variation#Effects on clouds|cloud formation]]. [[Sami Solanki|Solanki]] and co-workers suggest that solar activity for the last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years, however they said  "that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades", and concluded that "at the most 30% of the strong warming since [1970] can be of solar origin".&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote= There are many interesting [[palaeoclimate]] studies that suggest that solar variability had an influence on pre-industrial climate. There are also some detection–attribution studies using global climate models that suggest there was a detectable influence of solar variability in the first half of the twentieth century and that the solar radiative forcing variations were amplified by some mechanism that is, as yet, unknown. However, these findings are not relevant to any debates about modern climate change. Our results show that the observed rapid rise in global mean temperatures seen after 1985 cannot be ascribed to solar variability, whichever of the mechanisms is invoked and no matter how much the solar variation is amplified.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the direct aerosol effect had an approximately five times larger impact on climate forcing than the indirect aerosol and other cloud effects. The overall aerosol and cloud induced surface climate forcing is ~ 1 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; decade&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and has most probably strongly contributed to the recent rapid warming in Europe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Weather stations that are used to compute global temperature records are not evenly distributed over the planet, and their distribution has changed over time. There were a small number of weather stations in the 1850s, and the number didn't reach the current 3000+ until the 1951 to 1990 period&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/#faq {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) acknowledged that the urban heat island is an important ''local'' effect, but cited analyses of historical data indicating that the effect of the urban heat island on the ''global'' temperature trend is no more than 0.05&amp;nbsp;°C (0.09&amp;nbsp;°F) degrees through 1990.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Tropospheric temperature ====
General circulation models and basic physical considerations predict that in the tropics the temperature of the [[troposphere]] should increase more rapidly than the temperature of the surface. A 2006 report to the [[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]] noted that models and observations agreed on this amplification for monthly and interannual time scales but not for decadal time scales in most observed data sets. Improved measurement and analysis techniques have reconciled this discrepancy: corrected buoy and [[List of climate research satellites|satellite]] surface temperatures are slightly cooler and corrected satellite and [[radiosonde]] measurements of the tropical troposphere are slightly warmer.&lt;ref&gt;

There has been a public dispute regarding the apparent contradiction in the observed behavior of [[Antarctica]], as opposed to the global rise in temperatures measured elsewhere in the world. This became part of the public debate in the global warming controversy, particularly between advocacy groups of both sides in the public arena, as well as the popular media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/02/04/MN159039.DTL | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |title=Media goofed on Antarctic data / Global warming interpretation irks scientists | first=Keay | last=Davidson |date=4 February 2002|access-date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0118/p02s01-usgn.html|title=Guess what?

In contrast to the popular press, there is no evidence of a corresponding controversy in the scientific community. Observations unambiguously show the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] to be warming. The trends elsewhere show both warming and cooling but are smaller and dependent on season and the timespan over which the trend is computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chapman WL, Walsh JE |title=A Synthesis of Antarctic Temperatures |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=20 |issue=16 |pages=4096–4117 |year=2007 |doi=10.1175/JCLI4236.1|bibcode = 2007JCli...20.4096C |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study released in 2009, combined historical weather station data with satellite measurements to deduce past temperatures over large regions of the continent, and these temperatures indicate an overall warming trend.

=== Climate sensitivity ===
As defined by the IPCC, [[climate sensitivity]] is the "equilibrium temperature rise that would occur for a doubling of {{CO2}} concentration above pre-industrial levels".&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: "Climate Sensitivity", in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, IPCC said that climate sensitivity is "likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C with a best estimate of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains2-3.html |title=SYR 2.3: Climate sensitivity and feedbacks |access-date=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524223541/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains2-3.html |archive-date=24 May 2016 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth annual report, the lower end was lowered back to 1.5C, with the upper limit remaining at 4.5C. This is the range that was originally published in the 1990 report, which was in turn based on the 1979 'Charney report'.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Using a combination of surface temperature history and ocean heat content, [[Stephen E. Schwartz]] has proposed an estimate of [[climate sensitivity]] of 1.9 ± 1.0&amp;nbsp;K for doubled {{Co2}}.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/pubs/HeatCapCommentResponse.pdf Response to Comments on "Heat capacity, time constant, and sensitivity of Earth's climate system"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703194056/http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/pubs/HeatCapCommentResponse.pdf |date=3 July 2008 }}.

=== Infrared iris hypothesis ===
In 2001, [[Richard Lindzen]] proposed a system of compensating meteorological processes involving clouds that tend to stabilize climate change; he tagged this the "[[Iris hypothesis]], or "Infrared Iris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(2001)082&lt;0417:DTEHAA&gt;2.3.CO;2 |author1=Richard S.

[[Roy Spencer (meteorologist)|Roy Spencer]] ''et al.'' suggested "a net reduction in radiative input into the ocean-atmosphere system" in tropical intraseasonal oscillations "may potentially support" the idea of an "Iris" effect, although they point out that their work is concerned with much shorter time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations |author=Spencer, Roy W., Braswell, William D., Christy, John R. &amp; Hnilo, Justin |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=15 |pages=L15707 |doi=10.1029/2007GL029698 |year=2007 |url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/Spencer_07GRL.pdf |bibcode=2007GeoRL..3415707S |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103925/http://www.weatherquestions.com/Spencer_07GRL.pdf |archive-date=9 May 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature projections ===

[[James Hansen]]'s 1984 climate model projections versus observed temperatures are updated each year by Dr Mikako Sato of Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/T_moreFigs/PNAS_GTCh_Fig2.pdf {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RealClimate]] website provides an annual update comparing both Hansen's 1988 model projections and the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) climate model projections with observed temperatures recorded by [[GISS]] and [[HadCRUT]]. The measured temperatures show continuing global warming.&lt;ref name="RC12"&gt;http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/02/2011-updates-to-model-data-comparisons/ {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional projections of future temperature rises depend on estimates of future anthropogenic GHG emissions (see [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]]), those [[Climate change feedback|positive and negative climate change feedbacks]] that have so far been incorporated into the models, and the [[climate sensitivity]]. Models referenced by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4&amp;nbsp;°C (2.0 to 11.5&amp;nbsp;°F) between 1990 and 2100. Others have proposed that temperature increases may be higher than IPCC estimates. One theory is that the climate may reach a "[[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]]" where positive feedback effects lead to runaway global warming; such feedbacks include decreased reflection of solar radiation as sea ice melts, exposing darker seawater, and the potential release of large volumes of methane from thawing permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0916-09.htm |title=Global Warming 'Past the Point of No Return' |author=Steve Connor |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=16 September 2005 |access-date=7 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203231238/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0916-09.htm |archive-date=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Dr. Bert Bolin, in a speech to the National Academy of Sciences, predicted that by the year 2000, there would be a 25% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to the levels in 1859. The actual increase by 2000 was about 29%.&lt;ref&gt;Science News, 9 May 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study by [[David Douglass (physicist)|David Douglass]] and coworkers, concluded that the 22 most commonly used [[global climate model]]s used by the IPCC were unable to accurately predict accelerated warming in the [[troposphere]] although they did match actual surface warming, concluding "projections of future climate based on these models should be viewed with much caution". This result went against a similar study of 19 models which found that discrepancies between model predictions and actual temperature were likely due to measurement errors.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily_1207"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071211101623.htm|title=New Study Increases Concerns About Climate Model Reliability|access-date=4 April 2008 |date=20 December 2007 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forecasts confidence ===
The IPCC states it has increased confidence in forecasts coming from General Circulation Models or GCMs. Chapter 8 of AR4 reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''There is considerable confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental scales and above. This confidence comes from the foundation of the models in accepted physical principles and from their ability to reproduce observed features of current climate and past climate changes. Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation). Over several decades of development, models have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf |title=Climate Models and Their Evaluation |access-date=29 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922124304/http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf |archive-date=22 September 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Data archiving and sharing ===
{{Main|Climatic Research Unit email controversy}}
Scientific journals and funding agencies generally require authors of peer-reviewed research to provide information on [[Scientific data archiving|archives of data]] and share sufficient [[Data sharing|data and methods]] necessary for a scientific expert on the topic to reproduce the work.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In political controversy over the 1998 and 1999 [[Temperature record of the past 1000 years|historic temperature reconstructions]] widely publicised as the "[[hockey stick graph]]s", [[Michael E. Mann|Mann]], [[Raymond S. Bradley|Bradley]] and [[Malcolm K. Hughes|Hughes]] as authors of the studies were sent letters on 23 June 2005 from Rep. [[Joe Barton]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and [[Ed Whitfield]], Chairman of the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]], demanding full records on the research.&lt;ref name="CHE 505"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Congressman-Demands-Complete/121447/ |title=Congressman Demands Complete Records on Climate Research by 3 Scientists Who Support Theory of Global Warming — Archives |author=Richard Monastersky |date=1 July 2005 |newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlThe Committee on Energy and Commerce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/Letters/06232005_1570.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410114105/http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/Letters/06232005_1570.htm |archive-date=10 April 2011 |title=The Committee on Energy and Commerce, Joe Barton, Chairman |date=23 June 2005 |work=Letters Requesting Information Regarding Global Warming Studies |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |access-date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton to Mann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/Letters/062305_Mann.pdf |title=letter to Dr. Michael Mann |author=Joe Barton |author-link=Joe Barton |author2=Ed Whitfield |date= 23 June 2005 |publisher=[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] |access-date=4 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207152418/http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/Letters/062305_Mann.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 February 2012 |author2-link=Ed Whitfield }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The letters told the scientist to provide not just data and methods, but also personal information about their finances and careers, information about grants provided to the institutions they had worked for, and the exact computer codes used to generate their results.&lt;ref name="wapo Witches"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072201658.html |title=Hunting Witches |author=editorial |date=23 July 2005 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherwood Boehlert]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|House Science Committee]], told his fellow Republican Joe Barton it was a "misguided and illegitimate investigation" seemingly intended to "intimidate scientists rather than to learn from them, and to substitute congressional political review for scientific review". The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) president [[Ralph Cicerone]] wrote to Barton proposing that the NAS should appoint an independent panel to investigate. Barton dismissed this offer.&lt;ref name="urlGOP Face Off"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/17/AR2005071701056.html |title=GOP Chairmen Face Off on Global Warming |author=Juliet Eilperin |date=18 July 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waxman's letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henrywaxman.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Letter_to_Chairman_Barton.pdf |title=Letter to Chairman Barton |author=Henry A.

On 15 July, Mann wrote giving his detailed response to Barton and Whitfield. He emphasised that the full data and necessary methods information was already publicly available in full accordance with [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) requirements, so that other scientists had been able to reproduce their work. NSF policy was that computer codes are considered the intellectual property of researchers and are not subject to disclosure, but notwithstanding these property rights, the program used to generate the original MBH98 temperature reconstructions had been made available at the Mann et al. public [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] site.&lt;ref name="urlwww.realclimate.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/Mann_response_to_Barton.pdf |title=Letter to Chairman Barton and Chairman Whitfield |author=Michael E.

A ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial on 23 July which described the investigation as harassment quoted Bradley as saying it was "intrusive, far-reaching and intimidating", and Alan I. Leshner of the AAAS describing it as unprecedented in the 22 years he had been a government scientist; he thought it could "have a chilling effect on the willingness of people to work in areas that are politically relevant".&lt;ref name="wapo Witches" /&gt; Congressman Boehlert said the investigation was as "at best foolhardy" with the tone of the letters showing the committee's inexperience in relation to science.&lt;ref name="beeb 18 July 2005" /&gt;

Barton was given support by global warming sceptic [[Myron Ebell]] of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], who said "We've always wanted to get the science on trial&amp;nbsp;... we would like to figure out a way to get this into a court of law," and "this could work".&lt;ref name="beeb 18 July 2005" /&gt; In his ''Junk Science'' column on [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], [[Steven Milloy]] said Barton's inquiry was reasonable.&lt;ref name="Milloy FOXNews.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,163999,00.html |title=Tree Ring Circus |author=Steven Milloy |author-link=Steven Milloy |date=31 July 2005 |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |access-date=9 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208112922/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,163999,00.html |archive-date=8 February 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005 [[David Legates]] alleged in a newspaper op-ed that the issue showed climate scientists not abiding by data access requirements and suggested that legislators might ultimately take action to enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/comm/environment_and_public_works/general/repweeklycloser/TheWeeklyCloser9_23_05.pdf|title=The Weekly Closer from U.S. Senate, September&amp;nbsp;23,&amp;nbsp;2005.|access-date=29 December 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074617/https://www.senate.gov/comm/environment_and_public_works/general/repweeklycloser/TheWeeklyCloser9_23_05.pdf| archive-date = 28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boehlert commissioned the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to appoint an independent panel which investigated the issues and produced the [[North Report]] which confirmed the validity of the science. At the same time, Barton arranged with statistician [[Edward Wegman]] to back up the attacks on the "hockey stick" reconstructions. The [[Wegman Report]] repeated allegations about disclosure of data and methods, but Wegman failed to provide the code and data used by his team, despite repeated requests, and his report was subsequently found to contain plagiarised content. The "hockey stick" reconstructions and issues of data archiving and sharing subsequently became central features of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]].

Climatologist [[Kevin E. Trenberth]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The SPM [Summary for policymakers] was approved line by line by governments[...] The argument here is that the scientists determine what can be said, but the governments determine how it can best be said. Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy. The IPCC process is dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced assessment. However, in Shanghai, it appeared that there were attempts to blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report, most notably by Saudi Arabia. This led to very protracted debates over wording on even bland and what should be uncontroversial text... The most contentious paragraph in the IPCC (2001) SPM was the concluding one on attribution. After much debate, the following was carefully crafted: "In the light of new evidence, and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the Forum for Environmental Law, Science, Engineering, and Finance|year=2001|issue=8–26|first=Kevin|last=Trenberth|author-link=Kevin E.

As more evidence has become available over the existence of global warming debate has moved to further controversial issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Is Global Warming Real?|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-real/|date=2019-01-31|website=National Geographic|language=en|access-date=2020-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

# The social and environmental impacts
# The appropriate response to climate change
# Whether decisions require less uncertainty

The single largest issue is the importance of a few degrees rise in temperature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most people say, "A few degrees? So what? If I change my thermostat a few degrees, I'll live fine."&amp;nbsp;... [The] point is that one or two degrees is about the experience that we have had in the last 10,000 years, the era of human civilization. There haven't been—globally averaged, we're talking—fluctuations of more than a degree or so. So we're actually getting into uncharted territory from the point of view of the relatively benign climate of the last 10,000 years, if we warm up more than a degree or two. ([[Stephen H.

[[File:H&amp;WWonWashMon.png|right|thumb|The [[Washington Monument]] illuminated with a message from [[Greenpeace]] criticizing American environmental policy]]
The other point that leads to major controversy—because it could have significant economic impacts—is whether action (usually, restrictions on the use of [[fossil fuel]]s to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions) should be taken now, or in the near future; and whether those restrictions would have any meaningful effect on global temperature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Because of the economic ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]], who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits.&lt;ref name="taylorspeech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-jt011698.html|title=Global Warming, the Anatomy of a Debate: A speech by Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124172640/http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-jt011698.html |url-status=dead|archive-date=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.&lt;ref name="PBSpalmer" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The linkage between coal, electricity, and economic growth in the United States is as clear as it can be.

[[Council on Foreign Relations]] senior fellow [[Walter Russell Mead]] argues that the 2009 [[Copenhagen Summit]] failed because environmentalists have changed from "Bambi to Godzilla". According to Mead, environmentalist used to represent the skeptical few who made valid arguments against big government programs which tried to impose simple but massive solutions on complex situations. Environmentalists' more recent advocacy for big economic and social intervention against global warming, according to Mead, has made them, "the voice of the establishment, of the tenured, of the technocrats" and thus has lost them the support of a public which is increasingly skeptical of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will|Will, George]], "[http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 When Bambi becomes Godzilla] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909234738/http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 |date=9 September 2010 }}", ''[[The Denver Post]]'', 5 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of controversy is the fact that China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita|listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita]], they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] respectively, compared with for example the U.S. at position of the 14th largest per capita [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]].

=== Funding ===
{{See also|Climate change denial}}
The [[Global Climate Coalition]] was an industry coalition that funded several scientists who expressed skepticism about global warming. In the year 2000, several members left the coalition when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by [[John Passacantando]] and [[Phil Radford]] at Ozone Action. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', when Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition, it was "the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming".&lt;ref name="Canvassing Works"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Canvassing Works]] |url= http://www.canvassingworks.org/canvassingworks/2006/09/alumni_update_p.html |title= Canvassing Works |access-date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/07/business/ford-announces-its-withdrawal-from-global-climate-coalition.html |title=Ford Announces Its Withdrawal From Global Climate Coalition |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=21 July 2013|first=Keith|last=Bradsher|date=7 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, between December 1999 and early March 2000, the GCC was deserted by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, energy firm the [[Southern Company]] and General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=3440&amp;method=full|title= GCC Suffers Technical Knockout, Industry defections decimate Global Climate Coalition }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global Climate Coalition]] closed in 2002, or in their own words, 'deactivated'.&lt;ref name="org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalclimate.org/ |title=globalclimate.org|publisher=Global Climate |date=19 April 2003 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030419031622/http://globalclimate.org/ |archive-date = 19 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over most effective response to warming ===
In recent years some skeptics have changed their positions regarding global warming. [[Ronald Bailey]], author of ''Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths'' (published by the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] in 2002), stated in 2005, "Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up."&lt;ref&gt;

"There are alternatives to its [the climate-change crusade's] insistence that the only appropriate policy response is steep and immediate emissions reductions.... a greenhouse-gas-emissions cap ultimately would constrain energy production. A sensible climate policy would emphasize building resilience into our capacity to adapt to climate changes.... we should consider strategies of adaptation to a changing climate. A rise in the sea level need not be the end of the world, as the Dutch have taught us." says Steven F. Hayward of [[American Enterprise Institute]], a conservative think-tank.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2001, Richard Lindzen, asked whether it was necessary to try to reduce {{CO2}} emissions, said that responses needed to be prioritized. "You can't just say, 'No matter what the cost, and no matter how little the benefit, we'll do this'. If we truly believe in warming, then we've already decided we're going to adjust...The reason we adjust to things far better than Bangladesh is that we're richer. Wouldn't you think it makes sense to make sure we're as robust and wealthy as possible? And that the poor of the world are also as robust and wealthy as possible?"&lt;ref&gt;

The [[George W. Bush]] administration also voiced support for an adaptation-only policy in the US in 2002. "In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report [''U.S. Climate Action Report 2002''] to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. In the report, the administration also for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions—mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere." The report however "does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming."&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Despite conceding that our consumption of fossil fuels is causing serious damage and despite implying that current policy is inadequate, the Report fails to take the next step and recommend serious alternatives. Rather, it suggests that we simply need to accommodate to the coming changes. For example, reminiscent of former Interior Secretary Hodel's proposal that the government address the hole in the ozone layer by encouraging Americans to make better use of sunglasses, suntan lotion and broad-brimmed hats, the Report suggests that we can deal with heat-related health impacts by increased use of air-conditioning&amp;nbsp;... Far from proposing solutions to the climate change problem, the Administration has been adopting energy policies that would actually increase greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, even as the Report identifies increased air conditioner use as one of the 'solutions' to climate change impacts, the Department of Energy has decided to roll back energy efficiency standards for air conditioners.|sign=Letter from 11 State Attorneys General to George W.

Some find this shift and attitude disingenuous and indicative of an inherent bias against prevention (i.e. reducing emissions/consumption) and for the prolonging of profits to the oil industry at the expense of the environment. "Now that the dismissal of climate change is no longer fashionable, the professional deniers are trying another means of stopping us from taking action. It would be cheaper, they say, to wait for the impacts of climate change and then adapt to them" says writer and environmental activist George Monbiot&lt;ref&gt;

=== Political pressure on scientists ===
Many climate scientists state that they are put under enormous pressure to distort or hide any scientific results which suggest that human activity is to blame for global warming. A survey of climate scientists which was reported to the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2007, noted "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change', 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." These scientists were pressured to tailor their reports on global warming to fit the Bush administration's climate change scepticism. In some cases, this occurred at the request of former oil-industry lobbyist Phil Cooney, who worked for the American Petroleum Institute before becoming chief of staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (he resigned in 2005, before being hired by ExxonMobil).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070402170841/http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn11074 US climate scientists pressured on climate change], NewScientist, 31 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, a report by NASA's Office of the Inspector General concluded that NASA staff appointed by the White House had censored and suppressed scientific data on global warming in order to protect the Bush administration from controversy close to the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goddard |first=Jacqui |url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124090521/http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp |archive-date=24 November 2010 |title=Nasa 'played down' global warming to protect Bush|newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |access-date=12 February 2010 |date=4 June 2008 &lt;!-- https://www.webcitation.org/5nU8o9ZoY?url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(6 April 2006) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/05/AR2006040502150_pf.html "Climate Researchers Feeling Heat From White House"] ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The [[BBC]]'s long-running current affairs series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in 2006 investigated the issue, and was told, "scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate chaos: Bush's climate of fear|publisher=BBC Panorama|date=1 June 2006|access-date=14 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5005994.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists who agree with the consensus view have sometimes expressed concerns over what they view as sensationalism of global warming by interest groups and the press. For example, [[Mike Hulme]], director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, wrote how increasing use of pejorative terms like "catastrophic", "chaotic" and "irreversible", had altered the public discourse around climate change: "This discourse is now characterised by phrases such as 'climate change is worse than we thought', that we are approaching 'irreversible tipping in the Earth's climate', and that we are 'at the point of no return'. I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chaotic world of climate truth|first=Mike|last=Hulme|work=BBC News|date=4 November 2006|access-date=14 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6115644.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Associated Press release on 30 January 2007,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Climate scientists at seven government agencies say they have been subjected to political pressure aimed at downplaying the threat of global warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The groups presented a survey that shows two in five of the 279 climate scientists who responded to a questionnaire complained that some of their scientific papers had been edited in a way that changed their meaning. Nearly half of the 279 said in response to another question that at some point they had been told to delete reference to "global warming" or "climate change" from a report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups Say Scientists Pressured On Warming|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Associated Press]]|date=30 January 2007|access-date=14 April 2007|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/politics/main2413400.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The survey was published as a joint report  the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] and the [[Government Accountability Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Timothy|last1=Donaghy|first2=Jennifer|last2=Freeman|first3=Francesca|last3=Grifo|first4=Karly|last4=Kaufman|first5=Tarek|last5=Maassarani|first6=Lexi|last6=Shultz|chapter=Appendix A: UCS Climate Scientist Survey Text and Responses (Federal)|title=Atmosphere of Pressure&amp;nbsp;– Political Interference in Federal Climate Science|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] &amp; [[Government Accountability Project]]|date=February 2007|chapter-url=http://www.whistleblower.org/storage/documents/AtmosphereOfPressure.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325053150/http://www.whistleblower.org/storage/documents/AtmosphereOfPressure.pdf|archive-date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the pressure from politicians, many prominent scientists working on climate change issues have reported increasingly severe harassment from members of the public. The harassment has taken several forms. The US [[FBI]] told [[ABC News]] that it was looking into a spike in threatening emails sent to climate scientists, while a white supremacist website posted pictures of several climate scientists with the word "Jew" next to each image. One climate scientist interviewed by ABC News had a dead animal dumped on his doorstep and now frequently has to travel with bodyguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC World News Sunday|work=ABC News|date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Virginia Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] claimed that leading climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]] had possibly violated state fraud laws, and without providing any evidence of wrongdoing, filed the [[Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation]] as a civil demand that the [[University of Virginia]] provide a wide range of records broadly related to five research grants Mann had obtained as an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have a chilling effect on future research.&lt;ref name="AAAS2010-05-18"&gt;

Exxon Mobil is also notorious for skewing scientific evidence through their private funding of scientific organizations. In 2002, Exxon Mobil contributed $10,000 to The Independent Institute and then $10,000 more in 2003. In 2003, The Independent Institute release a study that reported the evidence for imminent global warming found during the Clinton administration was based on now-dated satellite findings and wrote off the evidence and findings as a product of "bad science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Sudhakara|title=The Great Climate Debate|journal=Energy Policy|year=2009|volume=37|issue=8|pages=2997–3008|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.03.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not the only consortium of skeptics that Exxon Mobil has supported financially. The George C. Marshall Institute received $630,000 in funding for climate change research from ExxonMobil between 1998 and 2005. Exxon Mobil also gave $472,000 in funding to The Board of Academic and Scientific Advisors for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005. Dr. Frederick Seitz, well known as "the godfather of global warming skepticism", served as both Chairman Emeritus of The George C. Marshall Institute and a board member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Granados|first=Oriana Zill|title=The Doubters of Global Warming|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/reports/skeptics.html|publisher=PBS|access-date=19 February 2014|date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
Several lawsuits have been filed over global warming. For example, [[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] allowed the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to [[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act|regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]]. A similar approach was taken by California Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] who filed a lawsuit [[California v. General Motors Corp.]] to force car manufacturers to reduce vehicles' emissions of carbon dioxide. This lawsuit was found to lack legal merit and was tossed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lifsher |first=Marc |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |title=Global warming lawsuit dismissed |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/18/business/fi-warmsuit18 |url-status=live |archive-date=4 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004161743/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/18/business/fi-warmsuit18 |date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tanner |first=Adam |work=Reuters |title=Calif. suit on car greenhouse gases dismissed |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-autos-idUSN1736580020070918 |url-status=live |archive-date=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215065243/https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/18/us-california-autos-idUSN1736580020070918 |date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third case, [[Comer v.

==== Kelsey Cascade, Rose Juliana et. al. vs. United States ====

In a lawsuit organized by activist organization Our Children's Trust, a group of plaintiffs aged 8–19 sued the U. S. Federal Government, claiming "the government has known for decades that carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution has been causing catastrophic climate change and has failed to take necessary action to curtail fossil fuel emissions." On 8 April 2016, U. S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin denied defendant's motion to dismiss, arguing plaintiffs have standing to sue because they will be disproportionately affected by the alleged damages. "The intractability of the debates before Congress and state legislatures and the alleged valuing of short term economic interest despite the cost to human life," argued Coffin, "necessitates a need for the courts to evaluate the constitutional parameters of the action or inaction taken by the government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourchildrenstrust.org/sites/default/files/16.04.08.OrderDenyingMTD.pdf Findings and Recommendation 6:15-cv-1517-TC]&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote=(p1) ... there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * (p21-22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this warming is very likely due to human activities.
