'''Jennifer Lynn Lopez'''&lt;ref name=Cartlidge-book /&gt; (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname '''J.Lo''', is an American singer, actress, and dancer. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a [[List of In Living Color cast members#Fly Girls (house dance troupe)|Fly Girl]] dancer on ''[[In Living Color]]'', where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 [[Selena]] [[Selena (film)|biopic of the same name]], Lopez became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997) and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), and established herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Solid as a Rock|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=July 2003|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yYEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album ''[[On the 6]]'' (1999), which helped propel the [[Latin American music in the United States#1990s Latin Explosion|Latin pop movement]] in American music, and later starred in the psychological horror ''[[The Cell]]'' (2000). With the simultaneous release of her second studio album ''[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]'' and her romantic comedy ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 release, ''[[J to tha L–O! The Remixes]]'', became the first remix album in history to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Later that year, she released her third studio album ''[[This Is Me... Then]]'' and starred in the film ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]''.

After starring in ''[[Gigli]]'' (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'' (2004) and ''[[Monster-in-Law]]'' (2005). Her fifth studio album, ''[[Como Ama una Mujer]]'' (2007), received the highest first week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'' and released her seventh studio album ''[[Love?]]''. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the [[police show|police drama]] series ''[[Shades of Blue (TV series)|Shades of Blue]]'' and performed a residency show, [[Jennifer Lopez: All I Have]], at [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas]]. Lopez also produced and served as a judge on ''[[World of Dance (TV series)|World of Dance]]'' (2017–2020). In 2019, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a stripper in the crime drama ''[[Hustlers (film)|Hustlers]]''.

Lopez is considered a [[pop icon|pop culture icon]], and is often described as a [[Triple threat (entertainer)|triple threat entertainer]].&lt;ref name="BBMAs 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="People Magazine Awards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Review" /&gt; With a cumulative film gross of US$3.1 billion and estimated global sales of 70 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin entertainer in North America. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goudreau|first1=Jenna|title=The World's Most Powerful Women: 16 New Faces|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/08/22/worlds-most-powerful-women-new-faces-jennifer-lopez-laurene-powell-jobs/|website=[[Forbes]]|access-date=November 23, 2016|date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' listed her among the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2018.

[[File:JenniferLopez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lopez arriving at the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], August 2004]]

In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy ''[[Gigli]]''. The film was a [[box office bomb]] and is considered [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films of all time]]. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film.&lt;ref name="BOM Breakdown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=A Look Back at 'Gigli,' the Infamous Bennifer-Starring Film, on Its 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/01/a-look-back-at-gigli-the-infamous-bennifer-starring-film-on-its-10th-anniversary.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]]|access-date=October 17, 2016|date=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying "[It] was very tough", "the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tess Katz|first1=Emily|title=Jennifer Lopez Opens Up About 'The Gigli Era': 'It Was Very Tough'|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/jennifer-lopez-gigli_n_6523402|website=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=December 12, 2016|date=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, [[Still Jennifer Lopez]]. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by [[Andy Hilfiger]] as a "more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|title=No more velour: J-Lo label aims upmarket aims for high fashion cred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/11/fashion.shopping|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=December 10, 2016|date=February 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.&lt;ref name="timeTyrangiel" /&gt;

In March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]'', alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that "they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4580539/ns/today-entertainment/t/marketing-jersey-girl-post-gigli-world/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120727005648/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4580539/ns/today-entertainment/t/marketing-jersey-girl-post-gigli-world/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 27, 2012 |title=Marketing 'Jersey Girl' in a post-'Gigli' world |publisher=MSNBC |date=March 29, 2004 |access-date=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Lopez co-starred alongside [[Richard Gere]] in the drama ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'', a re-make of the [[Shall We Dance? (1996 film)|1996 Japanese film of the same title]]. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following ''Gigli''.&lt;ref name="BOM Breakdown"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Brandon|title=Bankability Breakdown: Jennifer Lopez|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2729|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=October 17, 2016|date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, ''[[Rebirth (Jennifer Lopez album)|Rebirth]]'', in February 2005. According to Lopez, ''Rebirth'' "came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did.
