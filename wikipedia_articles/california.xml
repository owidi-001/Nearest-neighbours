What is now California was first settled by various [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native Californian tribes]] before being explored by a number of Europeans during the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Spanish Empire]] then claimed and colonized it. In 1804, it was included in [[Alta California]] province within the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. The area became a part of [[Mexico]] in 1821, following its successful [[Mexican War of Independence|war for independence]], but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the [[Mexican–American War]]. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850, following the [[Compromise of 1850]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] started in 1848 and led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale immigration from other parts of the United States and abroad and an accompanying economic boom.

Notable contributions to [[Culture of California|popular culture]], for example in [[Media in Los Angeles|entertainment]], and [[Sports in California|sports]], have their origins in California. The state also has made noteworthy contributions in the fields of communication, information, innovation, environmentalism, economics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Opinion: California is Still America's Future|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/opinion-california-still-america-s-future-n708661|access-date=December 31, 2020|website=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McNamara|first=Melissa|date=October 30, 2006|title=California Is A Political Trendsetter|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-is-a-political-trendsetter/|access-date=December 31, 2020|website=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Benjamin|date=July 1, 2009|title=California Dreamers|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/california-dreamers/307484/|access-date=December 31, 2020|website=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the home of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], the oldest and largest film industry in the world, which has had a profound effect on global entertainment.

California shares a border with [[Oregon]] to the north, [[Nevada]] and [[Arizona]] to the east, and the Mexican state of [[Baja California]] to the south. The state's diverse geography ranges from the [[Coastal California|Pacific Coast]] and metropolitan areas in the west to the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains in the east, and from the [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] and [[Douglas fir]] forests in the northwest to the [[Mojave Desert]] in the southeast. The [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center. Although California is well-known for its warm [[Mediterranean climate]] and [[monsoon]] seasonal weather, the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist [[temperate rainforest]] in the north to arid [[Desert climate|desert]] in the interior, as well as snowy [[alpine climate|alpine]] in the mountains. All these factors lead to an enormous demand for water; in total numbers, California is the largest consumer of water on the entire continent of North America. Over time, [[Droughts in California|droughts]] and [[List of California wildfires|wildfires]] have increased in frequency, become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining California's [[water security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-camp-fire-science-20181110-story.html |title=California's most destructive wildfire should not have come as a surprise |first1=Bettina |last1=Boxall |first2=Paige |last2=St. John |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 10, 2018 |access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drought.gov/drought/ |title=Advancing Drought Science and Preparedness across the Nation |publisher=National Integrated Drought Information System |access-date=November 11, 2018 |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111042024/https://www.drought.gov/drought/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Etymology of California|Island of California}}

The Spaniards gave the name {{lang|es|Las Californias}} to the peninsula of Baja California and to Alta California, the region that became the present-day state of California.

The name likely derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of [[Calafia|Queen Calafia]], as recorded in a 1510 work ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián|The Adventures of Esplandián]]'' by [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ibMwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9 |title=California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names |last1=Gudde |first1=Erwin G. |last2=Bright |first2=William |publisher=University of California Press |date=2010 |orig-year=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-26619-3 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the fifth in a popular Spanish [[chivalric romance]] series that began with ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]''.&lt;ref name="Lavender 1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=California: Land of New Beginnings |last=Lavender |first=David |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-8032-7924-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/californialandof0000lave/page/27 27] |oclc=15315566 |url=https://archive.org/details/californialandof0000lave/page/27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=california&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |date=June 24, 1957 |editor-first=Douglas |editor-last=Harper |access-date=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.dictionary.com/e/california/ |title=What bizarre error gave California its name? |date=December 27, 2010|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful black women who wore gold armor and lived like [[Amazons]], as well as [[griffin]]s and other strange beasts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=Ruth |editor-first=Herbert Ingram |editor-last=Priestley |title=California: The name |chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/cu31924008278347|date=1917 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |pages=356–361 |chapter=Appendix A: Etymology of the Word 'California': Surmises and Usage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vogeley |first=Nancy |date=April 20, 2001 |title=How Chivalry Formed the Myth of California |journal=Modern Language Quarterly |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=165–188 |doi=10.1215/00267929-62-2-165|s2cid=163100071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fictional paradise, the ruler Queen Calafia fought alongside Muslims and her name may have been chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader, the Caliph.

Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000.{{sfn|Starr|2007|page=13}} The indigenous peoples of California included more than [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|70 distinct ethnic groups]] of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large [[chiefdom]]s, such as the [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]] and [[Salinan]]. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.

Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodríguez's idea of California as an island persisted. Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://exhibits.stanford.edu/california-as-an-island|title=California as an Island in Maps—Online Exhibits|website=Stanford University Libraries|access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Portolà expedition]] of 1769–70, Spanish [[missionary|missionaries]] led by [[Junipero Serra]] began setting up 21 [[Spanish missions in California|California Missions]] on or near the coast of [[Alta California|Alta (Upper) California]], beginning in [[San Diego]]. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (''[[presidio]]s'') and three small towns (''pueblos''). The [[Mission San Francisco de Asís|San Francisco Mission]] grew into the city of San Francisco, and two of the pueblos grew into the cities of Los Angeles and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Several other smaller cities and towns also sprang up surrounding the various Spanish missions and pueblos, which remain to this day.

The Spanish colonization led to mass deaths among the natives through epidemics of various diseases for which the indigenous peoples had no natural immunity, such as [[measles]] and [[diphtheria]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2021|reason=Needs support from an academic summary of historical records specific to California or rewrite of statement as an assumption that a pattern found elsewhere also occurred in CA and a solid source for the pattern elsewhere and for the validity of assuming CA follow the pattern.}} The establishment of the Spanish systems of government and social structure, which the Spanish settlers had brought with them, also technologically and culturally overwhelmed the societies of the earlier indigenous peoples. {{Citation needed|date=March 2021|reason=Needs support from academic summary of historical records specific to California or rewrite as assuming a pattern elsewhere also applied to CA and use a solid academic source for the pattern elsewhere and why it applies to California.

During this same period, sailors from the [[Russian Empire]] explored along the California coast and in 1812 established a trading post at [[Fort Ross]].{{sfn|Rolle|1998|pp=51–52}} Russia's early 19th-century coastal settlements in California were positioned just north of the northernmost edge of the area of Spanish settlement in [[San Francisco Bay]], and were the southernmost Russian settlements in North America. The Russian settlements associated with Fort Ross were spread from [[Point Arena, California|Point Arena]] to [[Tomales Bay]].&lt;ref name="Historical Atlas of California"&gt;Historical Atlas of California&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican rule===

[[File:California1838.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Alta California]] in 1838, when it was a sparsely populated Mexican province&lt;ref&gt;source: Encyclopædia Britannica 7th edition, 1842, "Mexico"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1821, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] gave [[Mexico]] (including California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta California remained as a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico.
The [[Missions of California|missions]], which controlled most of the best land in the state, were [[secularized]] by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=nps/&gt; The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence. These huge ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]'' or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. The ranchos developed under ownership by [[Californio]]s (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants. Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]].

From the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and the future Canada arrived in Northern California. These new arrivals used the [[Siskiyou Trail]], [[California Trail]], [[Oregon Trail]] and [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California.

The early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831 onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes, both internal and with the central Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Altman |first=Linda Jacobs |title=California |url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=rAgL-tgWOecC|page=117}} |access-date=March 16, 2013 |date=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-1737-8 |page=117}}{{break}}{{cite book |title=Testimonios: Early California Through the Eyes of Women, 1815–1848 |url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=DuvFpaRwJlgC||page=425}} |access-date=March 16, 2013 |date=2006 |publisher=Heyday |isbn=978-1-59714-033-1 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this tumultuous political period [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] was able to secure the governorship during 1836–1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr|2007|p=17|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Zd3L-BAN_04C|page=17}}}}{{break}}{{cite book |editor1-first=Mildred Brooke |editor1-last=Hoover |editor2-first=Douglas E. |editor2-last=Kyle |title=Historic Spots in California |url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=AYMPR6xAj50C||page=316}} |access-date=March 16, 2013 |date=2002 |publisher=Historic Spots in California |isbn=978-0-8047-7817-6 |page=316}}{{break}}{{cite book |last=Conway |first=J.

One of the largest ranchers in California was [[John Marsh (pioneer)|John Marsh]]. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as "Marsh's route". His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, George D. ''John Marsh, Pioneer: The Life Story of a Trail-Blazer on Six Frontiers'', pp. 237–39, The Chautauqua Press, Chautauqua, New York, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, pp. ix, 209, 231, 238–39, 246–51, 266–67, 268–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh became involved in a military battle between the much-hated Mexican general, [[Manuel Micheltorena]] and the California governor he had replaced, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The armies of each met at the [[Battle of Providencia]] near Los Angeles. Marsh had been forced against his will to join Micheltorena's army. Ignoring his superiors, during the battle, he signaled the other side for a parley. There were many settlers from the United States fighting on both sides. He convinced these men that they had no reason to be fighting each other. As a result of Marsh's actions, they abandoned the fight, Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born [[Pio Pico]] was returned to the governorship. This paved the way to California's ultimate acquisition by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, 1931, pp. 250–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Irving.

In 1846, a group of American settlers in and around [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] rebelled against Mexican rule during the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. Afterwards, rebels raised the [[Bear Flag]] (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words "California Republic") at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was [[William B.

Following the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]]. The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.&lt;ref name="Osborne2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas J. |last=Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=FvA3jL4CFCMC}}|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances. Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands. The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush. By the time of California's application for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had multiplied to 100,000.

The United States [[consulate]] had also been located in Monterey, under consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]].

In 1849, a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the first tasks of the Convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] (1852–1853), and nearby [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] since 1854&lt;ref name="Wilson 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Dotson |last2=Ebbert |first2=Brian S. |date=2006 |title=California's Legislature |edition=2006 |url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pdf/caleg11.pdf |location=Sacramento |publisher=California State Assembly |oclc=70700867}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to [[Great Flood of 1862|flooding in Sacramento]].
Once the state's Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for [[Admission to the Union|admission to statehood]]. On September 9, 1850, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], California became a [[Slave states and free states|free state]] and September{{nbs}}9 a [[California Admission Day|state holiday]].

During the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), California sent gold shipments eastwards to Washington [[California in the American Civil War|in support of the Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/10-facts-california-during-civil-war 10 Facts: California during the Civil War] Civil War Trust. Downloaded September 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort. Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|"California 100 Company"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.

At the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years later, and seven years after it was greenlighted by President Lincoln, the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869. California was then reachable from the eastern States in a week's time.

Much of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

In the nineteenth century, a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the Gold Rush or to seek work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Chinese Experience in 19th Century America |url=http://teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu/chinese_exp/introduction04.html |website=teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah, perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti-Chinese riots in the state, and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Immigration to the United States, 1851-1900 {{!}} Rise of Industrial America, 1876-1900 {{!}} U.S. History Primary Source Timeline {{!}} Classroom Materials at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/immigration-to-united-states-1851-1900/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617|title=Destruction of the California Indians|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|access-date=April 15, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617|archive-date=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under its new American administration, California's harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve. As in other American states, many of the native inhabitants were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming American settlers such as miners, ranchers, and farmers. Although California had entered the American union as a free state, the "loitering or orphaned Indians" were de facto enslaved by their new Anglo-American masters under the 1853 ''[[Act for the Government and Protection of Indians]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Act for the Government and Protection of Indians {{!}} American Experience {{!}} PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldrush-act-for-government-and-protection-of-indians/|access-date=2021-03-03|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed.

Between 1850 and 1860, the California state government paid around 1.5{{nbs}}million dollars (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html |title=California Militia and Expeditions Against the Indians, 1850–1859 |publisher=Militarymuseum.org |access-date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. In later decades, the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2012-05-11|title=INDIANS of CALIFORNIA - American Period|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|access-date=2021-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511152205/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|archive-date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the rise of California was a calamity for the native inhabitants. Several scholars and Native American activists, including Benjamin Madley and [[Ed Castillo]], have described the actions of the California government [[California Genocide|as a genocide]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American Genocide {{!}} Yale University Press|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300181364/american-genocide|access-date=2021-03-03|website=yalebooks.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to the US and California specifically to attempt to purchase and own land in the state. However, the state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The U.S. Mainland: Growth and Resistance |url=https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/japanese/the-us-mainland-growth-and-resistance/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps such as at [[Tule Lake National Monument|Tule Lake]] and [[Manzanar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind the Wire: Japanese Immigration and Relocation in U.S. History |url=https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/japanese/behind-the-wire/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA |access-date=February 8, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020, California officially apologized for this internment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dil |first1=Cuneyt |title=California apologizes for Japanese American internment |url=https://apnews.com/article/4b9234383de4814974f81e78a1edaa95 |website=AP NEWS |access-date=February 8, 2021 |date=February 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the [[Lincoln Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|Route 66]]. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California—Race and Hispanic Origin: 1850 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url= https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archive-date=December 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the [[California Aqueduct|California]] and [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]]s; the [[Oroville Dam|Oroville]] and [[Shasta Dam]]s; and the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay]] and [[Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate]] Bridges were built across the state. The state government also adopted the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.

Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the [[studio system]] in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during [[World War II]], ranking third (behind [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michigan]]) among the 48 states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M.

Although air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued.

An [[2000–01 California electricity crisis|energy crisis in 2001]] led to [[rolling blackout]]s, soaring power rates, and the importation of electricity from neighboring states. [[Southern California Edison]] and [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] came under heavy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Severin Borenstein, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696582 "The Trouble With Electricity Markets: Understanding California's Restructuring Disaster"], ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Winter 2002, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp. 191–211 (in JSTOR)&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase; a modest home which in the 1960s cost $25,000 would cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. [[Mortgage]] companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The [[subprime mortgage crisis|bubble burst]] in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M.

In the middle of the state lies the [[California Central Valley]], bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east, the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coastal mountain ranges]] in the west, the [[Cascade Range]] to the north and by the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland.

Divided in two by the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], the northern portion, the [[Sacramento Valley]] serves as the watershed of the [[Sacramento River]], while the southern portion, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is the watershed for the [[San Joaquin River]]. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be [[seaport]]s.

The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of [[pump (Water)|pumps]] and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23{{nbs}}million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.

[[Suisun Bay]] lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the [[Carquinez Strait]], which flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], a northern extension of [[San Francisco Bay]], which then connects to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via the [[Golden Gate]] strait.

The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] are located off the [[South Coast (California)|Southern coast]], while the [[Farallon Islands]] lie west of San Francisco.

To the east of the Sierra Nevada are [[Owens Valley]] and [[Mono Lake]], an essential [[bird migration|migratory bird]] habitat. In the western part of the state is [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Although Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including [[Palisade Glacier]], the southernmost glacier in the United States.

The [[Tulare Lake]] was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.

In the south is a large inland salt lake, the [[Salton Sea]]. The south-central desert is called the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]; to the northeast of the Mojave lies [[Death Valley]], which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the [[Badwater Basin]] at {{convert|−279|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=NED/&gt; The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than {{convert|90|mi|km}}. Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the [[Colorado River]], from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.

A majority of California's cities are located in either the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] or the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]] in [[Northern California]]; or the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles area]], the [[Inland Empire]], or the [[San Diego metropolitan area]] in [[Southern California]]. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast.

As part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], California is subject to [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, droughts, [[Santa Ana winds]], [[wildfire]]s, [[landslide]]s on steep terrain, and has several [[volcano]]es.

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of California}}

{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:California Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate]] types in California]]

Although most of the state has a [[Mediterranean climate]], due to the state's large size the climate ranges from [[Polar climate|polar]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.

Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.

California's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the [[Nearctic realm]] and spans a number of terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s.&lt;ref name="Checklist of the Scarabaeoidea of the Nearctic Realm"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf

California's large number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species includes [[Relict (biology)|relict]] species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina ironwood (''[[Lyonothamnus floribundus]]''). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (''[[Ceanothus]]''). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, [[overgrazing]], and the introduction of [[exotic species]] have encroached on their habitat.

===Flora and fauna===

{{Main|Fauna of California|California Floristic Province}}
{{see also|List of California native plants}}
{{see also|List of invertebrates of California}}

California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the [[giant sequoia|largest trees]], the [[coast redwood|tallest trees]], and the [[pinus longaeva|oldest trees]]. California's native grasses are [[perennial plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Restoring Native Grasses"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/grass0504.htm |title=Restoring California's Native Grasses |journal=Agricultural Research Magazine |author=David Elstein |date=May 2004 |volume=52 |issue=5 |page=17 |access-date=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After European contact, these were generally replaced by [[invasive species]] of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.&lt;ref name="The California Invasive Species List"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf

Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower [[Sonoran Desert]]; upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.&lt;ref name="California: flora and fauna"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Flora-and-fauna.html |title=California: flora and fauna|publisher=city-data.com |date=2010 |access-date=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JoshuaTree 20140907.jpg|thumb|upright|A Joshua Tree (''[[Yucca brevifolia]]'') in [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]]]]
Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]] is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of [[aster (genus)|asters]]. [[Fremont cottonwood]] and [[valley oak]] thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. ''[[Nemophila]]'', [[Lamiaceae|mint]], ''[[Phacelia]]'', ''[[viola (plant)|Viola]]'', and the California poppy (''[[Eschscholzia californica]]'', the state flower) also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name="California: flora and fauna"/&gt;

The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood (''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'') and the "big tree" or giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]''), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). [[Tanbark oak]], [[California laurel]], [[sugar pine]], [[Arbutus|madrona]], [[Acer macrophyllum|broad-leaved maple]], and [[Douglas-fir]] also grow here. Forest floors are covered with [[Polystichum|swordfern]], alumnroot, [[barrenwort]], and [[trillium]], and there are thickets of [[huckleberry]], [[azalea]], elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, [[tulip]], and [[Lilium columbianum|tiger]] and [[Lilium pardalinum|leopard]] lilies.&lt;ref name="Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl."&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/sequoia/sempervirens.htm|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D.

The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the [[Jeffrey pine]], [[red fir]], and [[lodgepole pine]] to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf [[manzanita]] and ceanothus; the unique [[Calvatia sculpta|Sierra puffball]] is also found here. Right below the timberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about {{convert|10500|ft|m}}, begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including [[Primula suffrutescens|Sierra primrose]], [[Aquilegia flavescens|yellow columbine]], [[Ranunculus|alpine buttercup]], and [[Dodecatheon alpinum|alpine shooting star]].&lt;ref name="California: flora and fauna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html |title=Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada |publisher=sierrahistorical.org |access-date=October 5, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120301063716/http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html|archive-date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fauna found throughout several zones are the [[mule deer]], [[coyote]], [[mountain lion]], [[northern flicker]], and several species of hawk and sparrow.&lt;ref name="California: flora and fauna"/&gt;
[[File:Sea-otter-morro-bay 13.jpg|thumb|Sea otter in [[Morro Bay]], California]]

Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Golden trout|golden]], and [[Cutthroat trout|cutthroat]]. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include [[White seabass|sea bass]], [[yellowfin tuna]], [[barracuda]], and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.&lt;ref name="California: flora and fauna"/&gt;

===Rivers===

{{further|List of rivers of California}}

The most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and [[San Joaquin River]], which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley. The two rivers join in the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]], flowing into the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento–San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].

The [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with Arizona.

Most of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].

According to the United States Census Bureau in 2018 the population self-identifies as (alone or in combination):&lt;ref name=2018CensusDemo&gt;[https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/RHI125215/06 2018 U.S. Census QuickFacts], [[United States Census Bureau]], 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 0.5% [[Native Hawaiian]] or [[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]]
* 3.9% [[Multiracial American|Two or more races]]

By ethnicity, in 2018 the population was 60.7% non-Hispanic (of any race) and 39.3% [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] (of any race).

{{as of|2011}}, 75.1% of California's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Exner|first1=Rich|title=Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot|url= http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html|website=cleveland.com|publisher=Advance Ohio|access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents.

As a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken [[American English]] in California since the late 20th century.

{{Main|Culture of California}}

The culture of California is a [[Western culture]] and most clearly has its modern roots in the [[culture of the United States]], but also, historically, many [[Hispanic]] [[Californio]] and [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican]] influences. As a border and coastal state, Californian culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name="World of Opportunity"&gt;{{cite web |last=Park |first=Bborie |title=A World of Opportunity—Which New Languages Davis Students Would Like to Study and Why |publisher=[[UC Davis]] Student Affairs Research and Information |date=December 2003 |url= http://www.sariweb.ucdavis.edu/downloads/311AWorldOfOpportunity.pdf |access-date=December 27, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611013350/http://www.sariweb.ucdavis.edu/downloads/311AWorldOfOpportunity.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2015}}

California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as [[The Beach Boys]] promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.

The California Gold Rush of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.

[[Hollywood]] and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the [[cinema in the United States|U.S. film industry]]'s [[Major film studio|"Big Five" major film studios]] ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], and [[Warner Bros.]]) being based in or around the area.

The four major American television broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[NBC]]) all have production facilities and offices in the state. All four, plus the two major Spanish-language networks ([[Telemundo]] and [[Univision]]) each have at least two [[Owned-and-operated television stations in the United States|owned-and-operated TV stations]] in California, one in Los Angeles and one in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The largest [[religious denomination]]s by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 28 percent, Evangelical Protestants with 20 percent, and Mainline Protestants with 10 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 32 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions is 1% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.&lt;ref name="pew2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/Appendix-D-Detailed-Tables.pdf |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape, ''Appendix D: Detailed Tables''|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 12, 2015 |publisher=Pew Research Center |access-date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a change from 2008, when the population identified their religion with the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent.

The first priests to come to California were Catholic missionaries from Spain. Catholics founded [[California missions|21 missions along the California coast]], as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] and the [[Archdiocese of San Francisco]], the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.

A [[Pew Research Center]] survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the states: 62 percent of Californians say they are "absolutely certain" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is "very important", compared to 56 percent nationally.&lt;ref name="Helfland 2008"&gt;{{cite news |last=Helfand |first=Duke |title=State has a relaxed view on religion—Survey finds Californians are less certain about the existence of God than others in the U.S |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 24, 2008 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/local/me-faith24 |access-date=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], among others.

California is the only U.S. state to have hosted both the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter]] Olympics. The [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] summer games were held in [[Los Angeles]].

[[File:THS facade.jpg|thumb|[[Torrance High School]], one of the oldest high schools in continuous use in California]]

Public [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary education]] consists of [[High school (North America)|high schools]] that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a [[California Proposition 98 (1988)|unique constitutional amendment]] that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K–12 and [[community college]]s that grow with the economy and student enrollment figures.&lt;ref name="Prop 98"&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposition 98 Primer |work=LAO.ca.gov |publisher=California Legislative Analyst's Office |date=February 2005 |url= http://www.lao.ca.gov/2005/prop_98_primer/prop_98_primer_020805.htm |access-date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, California's K–12 public school per-pupil spending was ranked 22nd in the nation ($11,500 per student vs. $11,800 for the U.S. average).&lt;ref name=Governing_State_Ed_data &gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html |title=Education Spending Per Student by State |magazine=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]] |date=June 1, 2018 |access-date=July 18, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180702004654/http://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live |quote=NOTE: Adult education, community services and other nonelementary-secondary program expenditures are excluded. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's public [[postsecondary education]] offers three separate systems:
* The research university system in the state is the [[University of California]] (UC), a [[public university]] system.

* The [[California Community Colleges System]] provides lower division coursework as well as basic skills and workforce training. It is the largest network of higher education in the U.S., composed of 112 colleges serving a student population of over 2.6{{nbs}}million.

California is also home to such notable private universities as [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Southern California]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and the [[Claremont Colleges]]. California has hundreds of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions.

California's economy is dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for about one-quarter of the state's economy.

With the passage of [[California Proposition 30 (2012)|Proposition 30 in 2012]] and [[2016 California Proposition 55|Proposition 55 in 2016]], California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal [[income tax]] rate with ten [[tax bracket]]s, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000 (though the top brackets are only temporary until Proposition 55 expires at the end of 2030). While Proposition 30 also enacted a minimum [[sales taxes in the United States#California|state sales tax]] of 7.5%, this sales tax increase was not extended by Proposition 55 and reverted to a previous minimum state sales tax rate of 7.25% in 2017. Local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes in addition to this minimum rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Proposition 30, Sales and Income Tax Increase (2012) |publisher=Ballotpedia |url= http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_30,_Sales_and_Income_Tax_Increase_(2012)#cite_note-taxfoundation_states-6 |access-date=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[real property]] is taxable annually; the ad valorem tax is based on the property's fair market value at the time of purchase or the value of new construction. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually or the rate of inflation (whichever is lower), per [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]].

Because it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy.

California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of [[controlled-access highways]] ('freeways'), [[limited-access road]]s ('expressways'), and highways. California is known for its [[car culture]], giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]]. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the [[California Department of Transportation]], nicknamed "Caltrans". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |url= http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/pulse-of-the-bay/read-while-you-are-waiting-traffic-clear |title=California Is Tops in Worst Roads—Pulse of the Bay |publisher=The Bay Citizen |date=September 2, 2010 |access-date=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/node/9621456 |work=The Economist |title=A bridge too far gone |date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://reason.org/files/19th_annual_highway_report.pdf|title=19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems (1984–2008)|website=Reason.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], was the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridge main span]] in the world at {{convert|4200|ft|m}} between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] (often abbreviated the "Bay Bridge"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at [[Yerba Buena Island]] through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at {{convert|76|ft}} wide by {{convert|58|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.html |title=The San Francisco—Oakland Bay Bridge Facts at a glance |publisher=[[California Department of Transportation]] |access-date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]], connecting Los Angeles and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pool |first=Bob |title=Pasadena Freeway getting a new look and a new name |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 25, 2010 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/25/local/la-me-parkway-20100625 |access-date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later extended south to the [[Four Level Interchange]] in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first [[stack interchange]] ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/navigating-the-stack-the-four-level-turns-58.html |title=L.A.'s Famous Four-Level Freeway Interchange, 'The Stack', Turns 58 |publisher=[[KCET]] |date=September 22, 2011 |access-date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX), [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|the 4th busiest airport in the world in 2018]], and [[San Francisco International Airport]] (SFO), [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2018]], are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more [[general aviation]] [[List of airports in California|airports]] throughout the state.

California also has several important [[seaport]]s. The giant seaport complex formed by the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Port of Long Beach]] in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The [[Port of Oakland]], fourth largest in the nation, also handles trade entering from the Pacific Rim to the rest of the country. The [[Port of Stockton]] is the farthest inland port on the west coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 18, 2005|first1=Steve |last1=Chawkins|title=Stockton Seeking to Capture Battleship|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/18/local/me-battleship18|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Highway Patrol]] is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in employment with more than 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state-maintained highways and on state property.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is by far the largest in North America. By the end of 2009, the California DMV had 26,555,006 driver's licenses and ID cards on file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State of California—Department of Motor Vehicles, Statistics for Publication, January Through December 2010|url= http://dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/official.pdf |access-date=February 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429064551/http://dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/official.pdf |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, there were 1.17{{nbs}}million new vehicle registrations in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_17197542 |title=California new-car sales up 13.1 percent in 2010 |website=San Jose Mercury News |access-date=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inter-city rail]] travel is provided by [[Amtrak California]]; the three routes, the ''[[Capitol Corridor]]'', ''[[Pacific Surfliner]]'', and ''[[San Joaquin (train)|San Joaquin]]'', are funded by Caltrans. These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the [[Northeast Corridor]] and ridership is continuing to set records.

The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.

The [[California Water Wars]], a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reisner, Marc|title=Cadillac Desert: The American West and its Disappearing Water|publisher=Penguin|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] said: "We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38{{nbs}}million people and not anymore 18{{nbs}}million people like we were in the late 60s.

===Legislative branch===

The [[California State Legislature]] consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly. Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to [[term limit]]s of three terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of two terms.

===Judicial branch===

California's legal system is explicitly based upon English [[common law]]&lt;ref name="Cal Civil Code 22.2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=22.2.|title=California Civil Code § 22.2|work=[[California Office of Legislative Counsel]]|access-date=March 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as is the case with all other states except [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]]) but carries a few features from Spanish [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], such as [[community property]].

[[California's judiciary system]] is the largest in the United States with a total of 1,600 judges (the federal system has only about 840). At the apex is the seven-member Supreme Court of California, while the [[California Courts of Appeal]] serve as the primary [[appellate court]]s and the [[California Superior Courts]] serve as the primary [[trial court]]s. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years. The administration of the state's court system is controlled by the [[Judicial Council of California|Judicial Council]], composed of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the [[State Bar of California]], and one member from each house of the state legislature.

===Local government===

{{Main|Local government in California}}

====Counties====

{{See also|List of counties in California}}

California is divided into 58 [[County (United States)|counties]]. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the [[Constitution of California]], they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When Government Fails: The Orange County Bankruptcy|first=Mark|last=Baldassare|date=1998|pages=67–68|publisher=[[Public Policy Institute of California]]/[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-21486-6|lccn=97032806|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=sDs4WZV0SRsC|page=67}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Democracy in California: Politics and Government in the Golden State|first1=Brian P.|last1=Janiskee|first2=Ken|last2=Masugi|date=2011|edition=3rd|page=105|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-0338-9|lccn=2011007585|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=23Y3Nxs0qWgC|page=105}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the county serves as the local government for all [[unincorporated area]]s. Each county is governed by an elected [[board of supervisors]].{{sfn|Baldassare|1998|p=50}}

====City and town governments====

Incorporated cities and towns in California are either [[Charter city|charter]] or general-law municipalities.&lt;ref name="Cal Gov Code 34502"/&gt; General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly-elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial. The [[Government of San Francisco]] is the only [[consolidated city-county]] in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction.

====School districts and special districts====

{{See also|List of school districts in California}}

About 1,102 [[school district]]s, independent of cities and counties, handle California's [[public education]].&lt;ref name="census2012p25"/&gt; California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts.&lt;ref name=census2012p25&gt;{{citation|title=Individual State Descriptions: 2007|pages=25–26|series=2007 Census of Governments|date=November 2012|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|url= http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/isd_book.pdf|ref={{harvid|Census|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographic area of a special district can spread across multiple cities or counties, or could consist of only a portion of one. Most of California's special districts are ''single-purpose districts'', and provide one service.

===Federal representation===

The state of California sends [[California's congressional districts|53]] members to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/representatives/#state_ca|title=Directory of Representatives|publisher=House.gov|access-date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nation's largest congressional state delegation. Consequently California also has the largest number of [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in national presidential elections, with 55.

In California, {{as of|lc=y|2009}}, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] had a total of 117,806 [[active duty]] servicemembers of which 88,370 were [[United States Navy|Sailors]] or [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], 18,339 were [[United States Air Force|Airmen]], and 11,097 were [[United States Army|Soldiers]], with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees. Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|Reservists and Guardsman]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0509.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111017094716/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0509.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 17, 2011 |title=Table 508.

In 2010, [[Los Angeles County]] was the largest origin of military recruits in the United States by county, with 1,437 individuals enlisting in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2011/military-recruitment-2010/ |title=Military recruitment 2010 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 30, 2011 |publisher=National Priorities Project |access-date=June 15, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{as of|2002|lc=y}}, Californians were relatively under-represented in the military as a proportion to its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Segal |first1=David R. |last2=Segal |first2=Mady Wechsler |date=2004 |title=America's Military Population |journal=Population Bulletin |volume=59 |issue=4 |page=10 |issn=0032-468X |url= http://www.prb.org/Source/ACF1396.pdf |access-date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, California, had 2,569,340 veterans of United States [[military service]]: 504,010 served in World War II, 301,034 in the [[Korean War]], 754,682 during the [[Vietnam War]], and 278,003 during 1990–2000 (including the Persian Gulf War).&lt;ref name="City Data CA Armed Forces"&gt;{{cite web |title=California—Armed forces |publisher=city-data.com |url= http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Armed-forces.html |access-date=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2010}}, there were 1,942,775 veterans living in California, of which 1,457,875 served during a period of armed conflict, and just over four thousand served [[Interwar period|before World War{{nbs}}II]] (the largest population of this group of any state).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.va.gov/VETDATA/docs/Demographics/New_Vetpop_Model/7lVetPop11_POS_State.xlsx |title=Table 7L: VETPOP2011 Living Veterans By State, Period of Service, Gender, 2010–2040 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 30, 2010 |website=Veteran Population |publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's military forces consist of the [[California National Guard|Army and Air National Guard]], the [[California State Military Reserve|naval and state military reserve]] (militia), and the [[California Cadet Corps]].

On August 5, 1950, a [[Silverplate|nuclear-capable]] United States Air Force [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bomber carrying a [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|nuclear bomb]] crashed shortly after takeoff from [[Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base]].

California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/30/eveningnews/main2138297.shtml |title=California Is a Political Trendsetter |date=October 30, 2006 |access-date=February 22, 2011 |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states. In the [[2016 United States presidential election]], California had the third highest percentage of Democratic votes behind [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;f=0|title=2016 Presidential General Election Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2020 United States presidential election#Results by state|2020 United States presidential election]], it had the 6th highest behind [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]], [[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], and Hawaii. According to the Cook Political Report, California contains five of the 15 most Democratic congressional districts in the United States.

Among the political idiosyncrasies, California was the second state [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|to recall their state governor]], the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including [[California Proposition 8|Proposition{{nbs}}8]] in 2008). Voters also passed [[California Proposition 71 (2004)|Proposition 71 in 2004]] to fund [[stem cell]] research, making California the [[Stem cell laws and policy in the United States#Legalization and funding|second state to legalize stem cell research]] after [[New Jersey]], and [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 in 2010]] to completely change the state's [[primary election]] process. California has also experienced [[California Water Wars|disputes over water rights]]; and a [[tax revolt]], culminating with the passage of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]], limiting state [[property tax]]es. California voters have rejected [[affirmative action]] on multiple occasions, most recently in November 2020.

The state's trend towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more [[Centrism|centrist]] than the national party.

Several political movements have advocated for [[Partition and secession in California|Californian independence]]. The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|access-date=March 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=November 9, 2016 |access-date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.

The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's electoral votes in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last eight elections,&lt;!--8 thru 2020--&gt; starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].

In the United States House, the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38–15 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.

In general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2021, out of the 25,166,581 people eligible to vote, 22,154,304 people were registered to vote.&lt;ref name="SoS2021GenVotRegStats"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/report-registration/ror-odd-year-2021 |title=Voter Registration by County |date=February 10, 2021 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=May 27, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (10,228,144), Republicans (5,347,377), and [[Independent voter|No Party Preference]] (5,258,223).&lt;ref name="SoS2021GenVotRegStats" /&gt; [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (3,043,535) and Republicans (995,112) of any county in the state.&lt;ref name="SoS2021GenVotRegStats" /&gt;
