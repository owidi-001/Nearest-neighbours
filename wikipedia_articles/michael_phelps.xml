At Nationals, the selection meet for the [[2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]], in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''Beneath the Surface'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by [[Tom Dolan]] with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of [[Erik Vendt]], who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by [[Klete Keller]] and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat [[Ian Crocker]].&lt;ref name="Phelps, ''Beneath the Surface'', p. 110"&gt;Phelps, ''Beneath the Surface'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of [[Erik Vendt]] with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to [[Tom Malchow]], finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with [[Nate Dusing]], Klete Keller, and [[Chad Carvin]], won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of [[Aaron Peirsol]], [[Brendan Hansen]], Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.&lt;ref name="Phelps, ''Beneath the Surface'', p. 111"&gt;Phelps, ''Beneath the Surface'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United States Swimming National Championships|US Nationals]] in [[Indianapolis]] on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by [[Ryan Lochte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaswimming.org/_Rainbow/Documents/58786eab-e330-47a6-8f18-e50e65be34db/men200mbackf.htm |title=Men 200 LC Meter Backstroke |publisher=[[USA Swimming]] |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by [[Aaron Peirsol]] and the second-fastest performance of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SPORT/08/04/swim.phelps.reut/index.html?eref=edition_sport |title=Phelps grabs two titles in an hour |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.

====Trials====
At the [[2008 United States Olympic Trials (swimming)|2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials]], Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=0001080B0005000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01 |title=2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – 400 m individual medley results (final) |publisher=Omega Timing |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of [[Peter Vanderkaay]]'s time 1:45.85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=0001080B001C000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01 |title=2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – 200 m freestyle results (final) |publisher=Omega Timing |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=0001080B0022000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01 |title=2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – 100 m freestyle results (heats) |publisher=Omega Timing |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=0001080B0028000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01 |title=2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – 200 m butterfly results (final) |publisher=Omega Timing |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=0001080B0040000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01 |title=2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – 200 m individual medley results (final) |publisher=Omega Timing |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=0001080B0046000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01 |title=2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials – 100 m butterfly results (final) |publisher=Omega Timing |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, "I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can."&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beijing====
Phelps set an [[Olympic record]] in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind [[Alain Bernard]], managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of "smashing the Americans" had "fired me up more than anything else". ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' noted "Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard" and wrote that this sportsmanship was "proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Jeff Z., [http://beijing2008.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/what-the-world-is-saying-in-france-a-bitter-defeat-yes-but-no-mention-of-freedom-fries/?_r=0 "What the World Is Saying: In France, a Bitter Defeat, but No Mention of Freedom Fries"]. ''The News York Times'', August 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist [[Park Tae-hwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining [[Mark Spitz]], [[Larisa Latynina]], [[Paavo Nurmi]], and [[Carl Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre butterfly|200-meter butterfly]], Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist [[László Cseh]] by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to "see anything for the last 100 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.

Less than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, [[Ricky Berens]], and [[Peter Vanderkaay]], he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Seventh gold medal=====
[[File:Phelps4x100.jpg|thumb|left|Phelps ''(in black cap)'' starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008]]
Before the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer [[Milorad Čavić]] caused a minor stir when he said it would be "good" if Phelps lost. "It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy", Čavić said.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Phelps responded, "When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything."&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact [[Ian Crocker]]'s world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.

Phelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the [[International Swimming Federation|FINA]] panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=By Withholding Photos, Olympic Timekeeper Draws Attention to Relationship With Phelps |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/sports/olympics/21longman.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 20, 2008 |access-date=June 13, 2010 |first=Jeré |last=Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čavić later wrote in his blog, "People, this is the greatest moment of my life.

Phelps's seventh gold medal of the Games tied [[Mark Spitz]]'s [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games|record]] for gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, set in the 1972 Olympics. It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games#List of most individual gold medals won at a single Olympic Games|record]] for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by [[Eric Heiden]] in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by [[Vitaly Scherbo]] at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, "Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phenomenal Phelps wins 7th gold by 0.01 seconds to tie Spitz |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/swimming/news/story?id=3537831 |access-date=August 1, 2012 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=August 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====All-time record=====
On August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking [[Mark Spitz]]'s record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.&lt;ref name="Phelps, No Limits, p. 218"&gt;Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Phelps, along with teammates [[Brendan Hansen]], [[Aaron Peirsol]], and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phelps claims Olympic-record eighth gold medal with relay win |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/16/bc.oly.swm.phelps.medley.relay.ap/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=August 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412041039/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/16/bc.oly.swm.phelps.medley.relay.ap/ |archive-date=April 12, 2010 |access-date=August 25, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, "Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ...

At the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]], Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Records Fall in Swimming, and It's Only Day 1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/sports/27swim.html |work=The New York Times |author=Karen Crouse |date=July 27, 2009 |access-date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's [[Paul Biedermann]].

For the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, "I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here."&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the [[2012 United States Olympic Trials (swimming)|2012 United States Olympic Trials]], the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008.

This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey".&lt;ref name="nbcolympics.com1"/&gt; Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps "scaled back his calorie intake" and "increased his postswim ice baths". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps "felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/sports/olympics/michael-phelps-swimming-rehab.html|title=Seeking Answers, Michael Phelps Finds Himself|first=Karen|last=Crouse|date=June 24, 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 US Nationals===

====Trials====
At the [[2016 United States Olympic Trials (swimming)|US trials]] in Omaha for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after [[Dara Torres]], to qualify for a fifth Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://swimswam.com/phelps-makes-fifth-olympic-team/ |title=Michael Phelps makes fifth Olympic Team |first1=Hannah |last1=Hecht |date=June 29, 2016 |publisher=Swimswam |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out "the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2016/08/08/can-extraterrestrial-michael-phelps-bag-6-rio-olympics-gold-medals.html|title=Can 'extraterrestrial' Michael Phelps bag 6 Rio Olympics gold medals?|first=Paul|last=Newberry|date=August 8, 2016|via=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said "I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being.

He publicly apologized, saying his behavior was "inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phelps Disciplined Over Marijuana Pipe Incident |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/sports/othersports/06phelps.html?ref=sports |work=The New York Times |first=Juliet |last=Macur |date=February 5, 2009 |access-date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
