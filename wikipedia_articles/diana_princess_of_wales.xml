'''Diana, Princess of Wales''' (born '''Diana Frances Spencer'''; 1 July 1961&amp;nbsp;– 31 August 1997), was a member of the [[British royal family]]. She was the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]—the [[heir apparent]] to the British throne—and mother of [[Prince William]] and [[Prince Harry]]. Diana's activism and glamour made her an international icon and earned her enduring popularity as well as unprecedented public scrutiny, exacerbated by her tumultuous private life.

Diana was born into the [[British nobility]] and grew up close to the royal family on their [[Sandringham estate]]. In 1981, while working as a nursery teacher's assistant, she became engaged to Prince Charles, the eldest son of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|Their wedding]] took place at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1981 and made her [[Princess of Wales]], a role in which she was enthusiastically received by the public. The couple had two sons, William and Harry, who were then second and third in the [[line of succession to the British throne]]. Diana's marriage to Charles, however, suffered due to their incompatibility and extramarital affairs. They separated in 1992, soon after the breakdown of their relationship became public knowledge. The details of their marital difficulties became increasingly publicised, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1996.

As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions across the [[Commonwealth realms]]. She was celebrated in the media for her unconventional approach to charity work. Her patronages initially centred on children and the elderly but she later became known for her involvement in two particular campaigns, that involving the social attitudes towards and the acceptance of [[AIDS]] patients,  and the campaign promoted through the [[International Red Cross]] for the removal of landmines. She also raised awareness and advocated ways to help people affected with cancer and mental illness. The Princess was initially noted for her shyness, but her charisma and friendliness endeared her to the public and helped her reputation survive the acrimonious collapse of her marriage. Considered to be very photogenic, she was a leader of fashion in the 1980s and 1990s. [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana's death]] in a car crash in Paris led to extensive public mourning and global media attention. Her legacy has had a deep impact on the royal family and [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1979–present)#Diana, Princess of Wales|British society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/world/europe/princess-diana-death-anniversary.html |title=Diana's Legacy: A Reshaped Monarchy, a More Emotional U.K. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831052748/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/world/europe/princess-diana-death-anniversary.html |date=30 August 1997 |archive-date=31 August 2017 |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Diana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk.{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=70}} She was the fourth of five children of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer|John Spencer, Viscount Althorp]] (1924–1992), and [[Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp]] ([[née]] [[Baron Fermoy|Roche]]; 1936–2004).{{sfn|Morton |1997|pp=70–71}} The [[Spencer family]] had been closely allied with the [[British royal family]] for several generations;{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=32–33}} her grandmothers, [[Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer]] and [[Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy]], had served as [[ladies-in-waiting]] to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=2}} Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and after [[Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford|Lady Diana Spencer]], a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales.{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} Within the family, she was also known informally as "Duch", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2018090361835/princess-diana-sweet-childhood-nickname/|title=Princess Diana's sweet childhood nickname revealed in resurfaced letter – see photo|magazine=Hello!|first=Ainhoa|last=Barcelona|date=3 September 2018|access-date=17 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 1961,&lt;ref name="Time-Christening"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1650830_1650872_1653713-1,00.html |title=The Saddest Fairy Tale |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=16 August 2007 |access-date=3 February 2017 |first=Howard |last=Chua-Eoan |quote=...{{nbsp}}she died, suddenly, the day after the 36th anniversary of her christening{{nbsp}}... |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203163156/http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0%2C28804%2C1650830_1650872_1653713-1%2C00.html |archive-date=3 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana was baptised at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]].{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} She grew up with three siblings: [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], [[Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes|Jane]], and [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=37–38}} Her infant brother, John, died shortly after his birth one year before Diana was born.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=37}} The desire for an heir added strain to her parents' marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to [[Harley Street]] clinics in London to determine the cause of the "problem".{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} The experience was described as "humiliating" by Diana's younger brother, Charles: "It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it."{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the [[Sandringham estate]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=41}} The family leased the house from its owner, [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The royal family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with the Queen's sons [[Prince Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=2, 20}}

Diana was seven years old when her parents divorced.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=42}} Her mother later began a relationship with [[Peter Shand Kydd]] and married him in 1969.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=40, 42}} Diana lived with her mother in London during her parents' separation in 1967, but during that year's Christmas holidays, Lord Althorp refused to let his daughter return to London with Lady Althorp. Shortly afterwards he won custody of Diana with support from his former mother-in-law, Lady Fermoy.{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=40–41}} In 1976, Lord Althorp married [[Raine, Countess of Dartmouth]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=34}} Diana's relationship with her stepmother was particularly bad.&lt;ref name="Morton-Raine"&gt;{{cite news|title=Diana 'I thought of running off with lover'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1478421/Diana-I-thought-of-running-off-with-lover.html|access-date=23 April 2018|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=7 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423111132/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1478421/Diana-I-thought-of-running-off-with-lover.html|archive-date=23 April 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; She resented Raine, whom she called a "bully". On one occasion Diana "pushed her down the stairs".&lt;ref name="Morton-Raine"/&gt; She later described her childhood as "very unhappy" and "very unstable, the whole thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Andrew|title=Diana: Her True Story&amp;nbsp;– In Her Own Words: The Sunday Times Number-One Bestseller|year=2017|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|isbn=978-1782436935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_i0pDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=very++unhappy++very+unstable++Diana&amp;pg=PT39|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became known as ''Lady'' Diana after her father later inherited the title of [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]] in 1975, at which point her father moved the entire family from Park House to [[Althorp]], the Spencer seat in [[Northamptonshire]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=29}}

==Education and career==
Diana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her [[governess]], Gertrude Allen.&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt; She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], and moved to [[Riddlesworth Hall School]], an all-girls boarding school near [[Thetford]], when she was nine.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=21–22}} She joined her sisters at [[The New School at West Heath|West Heath Girls' School]] in [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]], in 1973.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=23}} She did not perform well academically, failing her [[GCE Ordinary Level (United Kingdom)|O-levels]] twice. Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath.&lt;ref name="TeenageRoyal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/diana-princess-wales|title=Diana, Princess of Wales|work=The British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household|access-date=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124095030/https://www.royal.uk/diana-princess-wales|archive-date=24 January 2017|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left West Heath when she was sixteen.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=35}} Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=40–41}} She showed a talent for music as an accomplished pianist.&lt;ref name="TeenageRoyal"/&gt; She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and [[tap dance]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=55}}

After attending [[Institut Alpin Videmanette]] (a [[finishing school]] in [[Rougemont, Switzerland]]) for one term, and leaving after the Easter term of 1978,&lt;ref name="tributepageroyalgovuk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Childhood and teenage years |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/diana2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302063016/http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/diana2.htm |website=The British Monarchy |publisher=The Crown |access-date=15 July 2019|archive-date=2 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana returned to London, where she shared her mother's flat with two school friends.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=41, 44}} In London, she took an advanced cooking course, but seldom cooked for her roommates. She took a series of low-paying jobs; she worked as a dance instructor for youth until a skiing accident caused her to miss three months of work.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=68}} She then found employment as a playgroup pre-school assistant, did some cleaning work for her sister Sarah and several of her friends, and acted as a hostess at parties. She spent time working as a nanny for the Robertsons, an American family living in London,{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=103}} and worked as a nursery teacher's assistant at the Young England School in [[Pimlico]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=45}} In July 1979, her mother bought her a flat at Coleherne Court in [[Earl's Court]] as an 18th birthday present.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=46}} She lived there with three flatmates until 25 February 1981.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=118}}

==Marriage==
Diana first met [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], the Queen's eldest son and [[heir apparent]], when she was 16 in November 1977. He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ythQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6693,1931194&amp;dq=frances+ruth+roche|title=Descendant of 4 Kings Charms Her Prince|newspaper=Daily Times|location=London|access-date=24 April 2016|date=24 July 1981|last=Glass|first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 when she watched him play [[polo]] and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride. The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht ''[[HMY Britannia|Britannia]]'' for a sailing weekend to [[Cowes]]. This was followed by an invitation to [[Balmoral Castle]] (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family one weekend in November 1980.&lt;ref name=age17nov&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal weekend fuels rumours|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DPRUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4597,379407&amp;dq=diana+spencer|access-date=22 July 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=17 November 1980|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}} She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]. Charles subsequently courted Diana in London. He proposed on 6 February 1981 at [[Windsor Castle]], and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=118}}

Twenty-year-old Diana became Princess of Wales when she married Charles on 29 July 1981. The wedding was held at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], which offered more seating than [[Westminster Abbey]], a church that was generally used for royal nuptials.&lt;ref name="TeenageRoyal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt; The service was widely described as a "fairytale wedding" and was watched by a global television audience of 750{{nbsp}}million people while 600,000 spectators lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the couple en route to the ceremony.&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/29/newsid_2494000/2494949.stm|title=1981: Charles and Diana marry|work=BBC News|date=29 July 1981|access-date=27 November 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307135340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/29/newsid_2494000/2494949.stm|archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the altar, Diana inadvertently reversed the order of his first two names, saying "Philip Charles" Arthur George instead.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; She did not say she would "obey" him; that traditional vow was left out at the couple's request, which caused some comment at the time.&lt;ref name="'70s 98"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got bare: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/98 98]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum|url-access= registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana [[Wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer|wore a dress]] valued at £9,000 ({{Inflation|UK|9000|1981|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) with a 25-foot (7.62-metre) train.&lt;ref name="Denney2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Denney|first=Colleen|title=Representing Diana, Princess of Wales: cultural memory and fairy tales revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NU7rpq8HFxYC&amp;pg=PA57|access-date=30 April 2011|year=2005|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-0-8386-4023-4|page=57|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425180829/https://books.google.com/books?id=NU7rpq8HFxYC&amp;pg=PA57|archive-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After she became Princess of Wales, Diana automatically acquired rank as the third-highest female in the [[British order of precedence]] (after the Queen and the Queen Mother), and was fifth or sixth in the [[orders of precedence]] of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant [[viceroy]], the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother, and the Prince of Wales.

On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=195}} In January 1982–12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal [[gynaecologist]] [[George Pinker|Sir George Pinker]] was summoned from London; the [[foetus]] was uninjured.&lt;ref name=TelgPinker&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550160/Sir-George-Pinker.html|title=Obituary: Sir George Pinker|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 May 2007|access-date=22 December 2012|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113043931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550160/Sir-George-Pinker.html|archive-date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling "so inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US TV airs Princess Diana tapes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3531997.stm|access-date=23 April 2018|publisher=BBC|date=5 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 1982, Diana gave birth to the couple's first son, [[Prince William]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/21/newsid_2518000/2518435.stm|title=1982: Princess Diana gives birth to boy|publisher=BBC|access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently suffered from [[postpartum depression]] after her first pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/royals/princess-diana-revealed-postpartum-depression-hit-me-hard/|title=Princess Diana Revealed Postpartum Depression 'Hit Hard' After William's Birth: 'I Was Troubled'|magazine=People|first=Stephanie|last=Petit|date=18 April 2019|access-date=19 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded. By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until [[Malcolm Fraser]], the [[Australian prime minister]], made the suggestion.{{sfn|Morton|1997|pp=142–143}}

A second son, [[Prince Harry]], was born on 15 September 1984.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=147}} The Princess said she and Charles were closest during her pregnancy with Harry. She was aware their second child was a boy, but did not share the knowledge with anyone else, including Charles.&lt;ref name="BBC-Hewitt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2273498.stm|work=BBC News|title=Hewitt denies Prince Harry link|date=21 September 2002|access-date=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215161416/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2273498.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She chose their first given names, dismissed a royal family nanny and engaged one of her own choosing, selected their schools and clothing, planned their outings, and took them to school herself as often as her schedule permitted. She also organised her public duties around their timetables.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=184}}

===Problems and separation===

Five years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference of 12 years became visible and damaging.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=174}} Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend [[Camilla Parker Bowles]], and Diana later began one with Major [[James Hewitt]], the family's former riding instructor. The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this. Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair.&lt;ref name="BBC-Hewitt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Holder, Margaret|url=http://www.themortonreport.com/celebrity/royals/who-does-prince-harry-look-like/|title=Who Does Prince Harry Look Like?

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana and unsuccessfully tried to effect a reconciliation.{{sfn|Brandreth|2004|pp=348–349}} Philip wrote to Diana and expressed his disappointment at the extramarital affairs of both her and Charles; he asked her to examine their behaviour from the other's point of view.{{sfn|Brandreth|2004|pp=349–351}} The Duke was direct and Diana was sensitive.{{sfn|Brandreth|2004|p=351}} She found the letters hard to take, but nevertheless appreciated that he was acting with good intent.{{sfn|Brandreth|2004|pp=351–353}} It was alleged by some people, including Diana's close friend Simone Simmons, that Diana and her former father-in-law, Prince Philip, had a relationship filled with tension;&lt;ref name="Burrell-Hasnat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575120/Prince-Philip-sent-%27nasty%2C-cruel%27-letters-to-Diana.html|title=Prince Philip sent 'nasty, cruel' letters to Diana|work=The Telegraph|date=11 January 2008|access-date=5 February 2017|first=Nick|last=Allen|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524045533/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575120/Prince-Philip-sent-%27nasty%2C-cruel%27-letters-to-Diana.html|archive-date=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7181240.stm|title=Philip 'sent Diana cruel letters'|work=BBC News|date=10 January 2008|access-date=9 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, other observers said their letters provided no sign of friction between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566132/Diana-and-Prince-Philip-the-truth.html|title=Diana and Prince Philip: the truth|work=The Telegraph|date=14 October 2007|access-date=2 February 2017|first=Andrew|last=Alderson|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204002813/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566132/Diana-and-Prince-Philip-the-truth.html|archive-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip later issued a statement, publicly denying the allegations of him insulting Diana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/25/world/philip-denies-calling-diana-vulgar-names.html|title=Philip Denies Calling Diana Vulgar Names|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 November 2002|access-date=9 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles's aunt, [[Princess Margaret]], burned "highly personal" letters that Diana had written to the Queen Mother in 1993.

[[File:Diana visiting drug squad.jpg|thumb|left|Diana visiting the drug squad of the [[West Midlands Police]] in 1987]]
Diana was a staunch and longtime supporter of charities and organisations that focused on social and mental issues, including [[Relate]] and [[Turning Point (charity)|Turning Point]].&lt;ref name="Tel-army"/&gt; Relate was relaunched in 1987 as a renewed version to its predecessor, the National Marriage Guidance Council. Diana became its patron in 1989.&lt;ref name="Tel-army"/&gt; Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, was founded in 1964 to help and support those affected by drug and alcohol misuse and mental health problems. She became the charity's patron in 1987 and visited the charity on a regular basis, meeting the sufferers at its centres or institutions including Rampton and Broadmoor.&lt;ref name="Tel-army"/&gt; In 1990 during a speech for Turning Point she said, "It takes professionalism to convince a doubting public that it should accept back into its midst many of those diagnosed as psychotics, neurotics and other sufferers who Victorian communities decided should be kept out of sight in the safety of mental institutions."&lt;ref name="Tel-army"/&gt; Despite the protocol problems of travelling to a Muslim country, she made a trip to Pakistan later that year in order to visit a rehabilitation centre in [[Lahore]] as a sign of "her commitment to working against drug abuse".&lt;ref name="Tel-army"/&gt;

===Privacy and legal issues===
In November 1980, the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' ran a story claiming that Charles had used the [[British Royal Train|Royal Train]] twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story "a total fabrication" and demanding an apology.&lt;ref name="November-80"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,922178,00.html|title=Press: Royal Pain|journal=Time|date=8 December 1980|accessdate=7 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1980/11/22/Another-round-in-Prince-Charles-matrimonial-sweepstakes/3429343717200/|title=Another round in Prince Charles' matrimonial sweepstakes|work=United Press International|date=22 November 1980|accessdate=7 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise.&lt;ref name="November-80"/&gt; In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media.

In 1993, [[Trinity Mirror|Mirror Group Newspapers]] (MGN) published photographs of Diana that were taken by gym owner Bryce Taylor.

On 5 September, Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to her in a live television broadcast.&lt;ref name="TeenageRoyal"/&gt; Diana's funeral took place in Westminster Abbey on 6 September. Her sons walked in the funeral procession behind her coffin, along with her ex-husband the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, Diana's brother Lord Spencer, and representatives of some of her charities.&lt;ref name="TeenageRoyal"/&gt; Lord Spencer said of his sister, "She proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/04/greatspeeches|title=The most hunted person of the modern age|date=4 May 2007|access-date=27 June 2011|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Earl|last=Spencer|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227062140/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/04/greatspeeches|archive-date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-written in tribute to Diana, "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]" was performed by [[Elton John]] at the funeral service (the only occasion the song has been performed live).&lt;ref name="Live performance"/&gt; Released as a single in 1997, the global proceeds from the song have gone to Diana's charities.&lt;ref name="Live performance"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Joe|title=17 Years Ago, Elton John's 'Candle In the Wind 1997' Started Its 14-Week No. 1 Run|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6281519/elton-john-candle-in-the-wind-1997-no-1-anniversary|agency=Billboard|date=11 October 2014|access-date=24 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118232145/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6281519/elton-john-candle-in-the-wind-1997-no-1-anniversary|archive-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/09/world/millions-of-dollars-pouring-in-to-diana-s-favorite-charities.html|title=Millions of Dollars Pouring In To Diana's Favorite Charities|work=The New York Times|last=Ibrahim|first=Youssef M.|date=9 September 1997|access-date=4 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104162857/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/09/world/millions-of-dollars-pouring-in-to-diana-s-favorite-charities.html|archive-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9711/19/showbuzz/|title=Elton John delivers proceeds to Diana charity|publisher=CNN|date=19 November 1997|access-date=4 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041201061646/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9711/19/showbuzz/|archive-date=1 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial took place privately later the same day. Diana's former husband, sons, mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Diana's body was clothed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by [[Catherine Walker (fashion designer)|Catherine Walker]], which she had chosen some weeks before. A set of [[rosary]] beads that she had received from [[Mother Teresa]] was placed in her hands. Mother Teresa had died the same week as Diana. Diana's grave is on an island ({{Coord|52.283082|-1.000278|region:GB_type:landmark}}) within the grounds of [[Althorp]] Park, the Spencer family home for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/althorp.html|title=Diana Returns Home|work=BBC|access-date=29 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202150815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/althorp.html|archive-date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial party was provided by the 2nd Battalion [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]], who were given the honour of carrying Diana across to the island and laying her to rest. Diana was the Regiment's [[Colonel-in-Chief]] from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name=army/&gt; The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby [[Great Brington]], but Lord Spencer said he was concerned about public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided Diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by William, Harry, and other Spencer relatives.&lt;ref name=sht6sep&gt;{{cite news|title=Burial site offers princess a privacy elusive in life|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=doAfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6658,1380599&amp;dq=burial+of+princess+diana|access-date=29 June 2015|newspaper=Sarasota Herald Tribune|date=6 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later events===
====Finances====
Following her death, Diana left a £21&amp;nbsp;million estate, "netting £17 million after estate taxes", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister, Lady Sarah.&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2014/09/16/as-remainder-of-princess-dianas-estate-passes-to-harry-troubling-questions-remain/#70c54e85f052|title=As Remainder Of Princess Diana's Estate Passes To Harry, Troubling Questions Remain|magazine=Forbes|first1=Danielle|last1=Mayoras|first2=Andy|last2=Mayoras}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-Will"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9803/04/diana.will/|title=Diana's will: The full text|publisher=CNN|date=4 March 1998|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have her sister Sarah replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-does-princess-diana-s-will-say-3505096|title=What Does Princess Diana's Will Say?|publisher=The Balance|first=Julie|last=Garber|date=31 May 2018|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9&amp;nbsp;million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="BBC-Finances"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/61285.stm|title=Diana leaves £21m|publisher=BBC|date=2 March 1998|access-date=9 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate. Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively.&lt;ref name="Tel-Estate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/diana/11069069/What-will-Prince-Harry-and-Prince-William-inherit-from-Princess-Diana.html|title=What will Prince Harry and Prince William inherit from Princess Diana?|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 September 2014|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/08/princess-diana-foresaw-prince-harrys-departure-royal-family/|title=Princess Diana foresaw Prince Harry's departure from Royal family, Duke claims|work=The Telegraph|first=Josie|last=Ensor|date=8 March 2021|accessdate=8 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to the princes.&lt;ref name="Tel-Estate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"/&gt; They were also put on display in American museums and {{as of|2011|lc=y}} raised two million dollars for charities.&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"/&gt; Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings, jewels and two diamond tiaras.&lt;ref name="Tel-Estate"/&gt; Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to Harry and William, respectively. The brothers eventually exchanged mementos and William later passed the ring to his wife, [[Catherine Middleton]]. The ownership of Diana's wedding dress was also given to her sons.&lt;ref name="Tel-Estate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/princess-diana-wedding-dress-exhibition-scli-intl-gbr/index.html|title=Princess Diana's wedding dress to go on display after William and Harry agree to loan|work=CNN|first=Rob|last=Picheta|date=27 April 2021|accessdate=28 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogue-ring"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/british-royal-family-engagement-rings#5|title=A Close Look at the British Royal Family's Engagement Rings|publisher=Vogue|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her will,&lt;ref name="CNN-Will"/&gt; Diana had also written a letter of wishes in which she had asked for three-quarters of her personal property to be given to her sons, and dividing the remaining quarter (aside from the jewellery) between her 17 godchildren.&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"/&gt; Despite Diana's wishes, the executors (her mother and sister) "petitioned the probate court for a "variance" of the will", and the letter of wishes was ignored "because it did not contain certain language required by British law".&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"/&gt; Eventually, one item from Diana's estate was given to each of her godchildren, while they would have received £100,000 each, had a quarter of her estate been divided between them.&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"/&gt; The variance also prevented the estate from being distributed between her sons at the age of 25 but postponed it until they were 30.&lt;ref name="Forbes-Estate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-Will"/&gt; Diana also left her butler Paul Burrell around £50,000 in cash.&lt;ref name="BBC-Finances"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-Will"/&gt;

====Subject of government surveillance====
In 1999, after the submission of a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request filed by the Internet news service ''apbonline.com'', it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the [[National Security Agency]] until her death, and the organisation kept a [[top secret]] file on her containing more than 1,000 pages.&lt;ref name="wapodiana"&gt;{{cite news|first=Vernon|last=Loeb|title=NSA Admits to Spying on Princess Diana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/dec98/diana12.htm|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=29 January 2018|date=12 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109051540/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/dec98/diana12.htm|archive-date=9 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa-guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Top secret US files could hold clues to death of Diana|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/11/monarchy.jamiedoward|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 January 2004|access-date=29 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108062410/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/11/monarchy.jamiedoward|archive-date=8 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of [[national security]] concerns.&lt;ref name="wapodiana"/&gt; The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a "target of [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure."&lt;ref name="wapodiana"/&gt; Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]]—the NSA has refused to release the documents.&lt;ref name="nsa-guardian"/&gt;

In 2008, Ken Wharfe, a former bodyguard of Diana, claimed that her scandalous conversations with James Gilbey (commonly referred to as the [[Squidgygate]]) were in fact recorded by the [[GCHQ]], which intentionally released them on a "loop".&lt;ref name="gchqdiana"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Allen|title=Diana's Squidgygate tapes 'leaked by GCHQ'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575117/Dianas-Squidgygate-tapes-leaked-by-GCHQ.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=29 January 2018|date=9 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903193451/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575117/Dianas-Squidgygate-tapes-leaked-by-GCHQ.html|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; People close to Diana believed the action was intended to defame her.&lt;ref name="gchqdiana"/&gt; Wharfe said Diana herself believed that members of the royal family were all being monitored, though he also stated that the main reason for it could be the potential threats of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]].&lt;ref name="gchqdiana"/&gt;

====Anniversaries, commemorations, and auctions====

Despite being regarded as an iconic figure and a popular member of the royal family, Diana was subject to criticism during her life. Patrick Jephson, her private secretary of eight years, wrote in an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that "[Diana] had an extra quality that frustrated her critics during her lifetime and has done little to soften their disdain since her death".&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Legacy"/&gt; Diana was criticised by philosophy professor [[Anthony O'Hear]] who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was "self-indulgent" in her philanthropic efforts.&lt;ref name="BBC-Criticism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/79288.stm|title=Author defends Diana criticism|publisher=BBC|date=17 April 1998|access-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318152247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/79288.stm|archive-date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his remarks, charity organisations that were supported by Diana defended her, and [[Peter Luff]] called O'Hear's comments "distasteful and inappropriate".&lt;ref name="BBC-Criticism"/&gt; Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself,&lt;ref name="NYT-Critics"/&gt; which in return "demeaned her royal office".&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Legacy"/&gt; Diana's unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases occasionally had a negative reaction in the media.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Legacy"/&gt;

Diana's relationship with the press and the paparazzi has been described as "ambivalent". On different occasions she would complain about the way she was being treated by the media, mentioning that their constant presence in her proximity had made life impossible for her, whereas at other times she would seek their attention and hand information to reporters herself.&lt;ref name="BBC-press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/press.html|title=The Princess and the Press|publisher=BBC|access-date=1 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/06/world/diana-and-the-paparazzi-a-morality-tale.html|title=Diana and the Paparazzi: A Morality Tale|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Roger|last=Cohen|date=6 September 1997|access-date=2 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''The Guardian'', Peter Conrad suggested that it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew they were the source of her power;&lt;ref name="Myth-Legacy"/&gt; thus, she "overburdened herself with public duties" and destroyed the border between private and public life.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Legacy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Critics"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/22/reviews/990822.22kermot.html|title=Shrinking the Princess|work=The New York Times|date=22 August 1999|access-date=5 February 2017|first=Frank|last=Kermode|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162942/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/22/reviews/990822.22kermot.html|archive-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Celebrity-Legacy"/&gt; This view was supported by [[Christopher Hitchens]], who believed that "in pursuit of a personal solution to an unhappy private life, she became an assiduous leaker to the press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-01-me-27885-story.html|title=Mother Teresa or Mrs. Simpson: Which Was the Real Diana?|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=1 September 1997|access-date=1 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200118081820/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-01-me-27885-story.html|archive-date=18 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Diana also used the media's interest in her to shine light on her charitable efforts and patronages.&lt;ref name="BBC-press"/&gt;

In an article written for ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1998, journalist [[Yvonne Roberts]] observed the sudden change in people's opinion of Diana after her death from critical to complimentary, a viewpoint supported by Theodore Dalrymple who also noticed the "sudden shift from cruel personal abuse to absurdly exaggerated respect".&lt;ref name="Dalrymple-1997"/&gt; Roberts also questioned whether she had achieved anything different from other members of the royal family and added that Diana was neither "a saint" nor "a revolutionary" figure, but "may have encouraged some people" to tackle issues such as landmines, AIDS and leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/one-year-on-dry-your-eyes-she-was-no-saint-and-her-death-changed-nothing-says-yvonne-roberts-1174708.html|title=One Year On: Dry your eyes!

Following the opening of an exhibition of Diana's clothes and dresses at Kensington Palace in 2017, [[Catherine Bennett (journalist)|Catherine Bennett]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said such exhibitions are among the suitable ways to commemorate public figures whose fashion styles were noted due to their achievements. The exhibition suggests to detractors who, like many other princesses, "looking lovely in different clothes was pretty much her life's work" which also brings interest in her clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/26/princess-diana-fashion-kensington|title=Diana shook up the royals but they have their poise back now|first=Catherine|last=Bennett|work=The Guardian|date=25 February 2017|access-date=2 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402171450/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/26/princess-diana-fashion-kensington|archive-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after her death, many sites around the world became briefly ''ad hoc'' memorials to Diana where the public left flowers and other tributes. Her son, Prince William, has stated that the outpouring of public grief after her death "changed the British psyche, for the better", while journalist [[Alastair Campbell]] noted that it assisted in diminishing "the [[stiff upper lip]] approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Alastair |title=Prince William on Diana, Princess of Wales |url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-william-diana-princess-of-wales |website=GQ |access-date=25 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest memorial was outside the gates of Kensington Palace, where people continue to leave flowers and tributes.

There were two memorials inside [[Harrods]] department store, commissioned by Dodi Fayed's father, who owned the store from 1985 to 2010. The first memorial was a pyramid-shaped display containing photos of the princess and al-Fayed's son, a wine glass said to be from their last dinner, and a ring purchased by Dodi the day prior to the crash. The second, ''[[Innocent Victims]]'', unveiled in 2005, was a bronze statue of Fayed dancing with Diana on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross.&lt;ref name="CNN090105"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/09/01/diana.dodi.statue/index.html|title=Harrods unveils Diana, Dodi statue|date=1 September 2005|access-date=30 January 2016|work=CNN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031720/http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/09/01/diana.dodi.statue/index.html|archive-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, it was announced that the statue would be returned to the Al-Fayed family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/tacky-statue-of-diana-and-dodi-fayed-to-be-removed-from-harrods|title='Tacky' statue of Diana and Dodi Fayed to be removed from Harrods|first=Chris|last=Johnston|date=13 January 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113231513/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/tacky-statue-of-diana-and-dodi-fayed-to-be-removed-from-harrods|archive-date=13 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diana in contemporary art===
Before and after her death, Diana has been depicted in [[contemporary art]]. The first [[biopics]] about Diana and Charles were ''Charles and Diana: A Royal Love Story'' and ''[[The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana]]'' that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively.&lt;ref name=bastin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|access-date=21 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119025128/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|archive-date=19 November 2015|doi=10.1080/08989575.2009.10846787|s2cid=220313542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired ''Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After'', a TV movie about marital discord between Diana and Charles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Ken|title=Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After|url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,312673,00.html|access-date=14 August 2013|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=11 December 1992|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021052129/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312673,00.html|archive-date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, British magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' called her "Cheryl" and Prince Charles "Brian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brett|first=Oliver|title=What's in a nickname?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7829013.stm|access-date=15 August 2013|work=BBC|date=15 January 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020180551/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7829013.stm|archive-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] created a number of monoprint drawings featuring textual references about Diana's public and private life for ''Temple of Diana'', a themed exhibition at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as ''They Wanted You To Be Destroyed'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Work illustrated on page 21 of Neal Brown's book ''Tracey Emin (Tate's Modern Artists Series)'' (London: Tate, 2006) {{ISBN|1-85437-542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; related to Diana's [[bulimia]], while others included affectionate texts such as ''Love Was on Your Side'' and Diana's ''Dress with puffy sleeves''. Another text praised her selflessness—''The things you did to help other people'', showing Diana in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola—while [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories#Conspiracy theories in contemporary art|another]] referenced the conspiracy theories. Of her drawings, Emin maintained "They're quite sentimental{{nbsp}}... and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/arts-and-culture/2009/07/tracey-emin-art-melodramatic|title=The tent is empty|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=16 July 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|access-date=15 February 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152722/http://www.newstatesman.com/arts-and-culture/2009/07/tracey-emin-art-melodramatic|archive-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer J. H. Round argued that the Despencer descent was fabricated by Richard Lee, a corrupt [[Clarenceux King of Arms]].&lt;ref&gt;Round, J.H. (1901) ''Studies in Peerage and Family History,'' A.

It depicted a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge shaped]] [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield of arms]], which symbolised her unmarried state. It included three escallops argent of the Spencer coat of arms. This version was used only before her marriage and was also applied by her sisters.
