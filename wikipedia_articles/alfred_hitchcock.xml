'''Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|size=100%}} (13 August 1899&amp;nbsp;– 29 April 1980) was an English&lt;!--as per [[MOS:BIO]]; In addition to notability, self identification; "I'm English": Hitchcock in a 1963 interview with Fallaci; see http://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2016/06/14/fallaci-hitchcock-interview/--&gt; film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is one of the most influential and widely studied filmmakers in the history of cinema.&lt;ref name="influential" /&gt; Known as the "'''Master of Suspense'''", he directed over 50 feature films{{efn|According to Gene Adair (2002), Hitchcock made 53 feature films.{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=9}} According to [[Roger Ebert]] in 1980, it was 54.&lt;ref name=Ebert1May1980&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert |title=The Master of Suspense is Dead |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-master-of-suspense-is-dead |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1 May 1980 |access-date=26 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226235234/https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-master-of-suspense-is-dead|archive-date=26 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo roles]] in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television anthology ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1955–65). His films garnered 46 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations including six wins, although he never won for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] despite having had five nominations. In 1955 Hitchcock became an American citizen.

Born in [[Leytonstone]], London, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the British-German silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British "[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]".&lt;ref name=Blackmail/&gt; Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.

By 1939, Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). ''Rebecca'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture]], although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]];&lt;ref name=Rebecca/&gt; he was also nominated for ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944) and ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945).

The "[[Hitchcockian]]" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film "is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole."{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}}  Hitchcock made multiple films with some of the biggest stars of Hollywood, including four with [[Cary Grant]] in the 1940s and 50s, three with [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the last half of the 1940s, four with [[James Stewart]] over a ten-year span commencing in 1948, and three with [[Grace Kelly]] in the mid-1950s.

After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954).  Between 1954 and 1960, Hitchcock directed four films [[List of films considered the best|often ranked]] among the greatest of all time: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.&lt;ref name="AFI top 100"&gt;{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Films of All Time |url=https://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |publisher=American Film Institute |access-date=8 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519213359/http://afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx |archive-date=19 May 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, his psychological thriller ''Vertigo'', starring Stewart, displaced [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[British Film Institute]]'s greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics.&lt;ref name=Christie2012/&gt; By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]],{{efn|The films selected for the [[National Film Registry]] are ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=21 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|archive-date=31 October 2016|url-status=live}}{{pb}}

Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents' leased grocer's shop at 517 High Road, [[Leytonstone]], on the outskirts of [[east London]] (then part of [[Essex]]), the youngest of three children: William Daniel (1890–1943), Ellen Kathleen ("Nellie") (1892–1979), and Alfred Joseph (1899-1980). His parents, Emma Jane Hitchcock (''{{née}}'' Whelan; 1863–1942), and William Edgar Hitchcock (1862–1914), were both [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], with partial roots in Ireland;{{sfn|Adair|2002|pp=11–12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irishecho.com/2011/02/st-patricks-day-2005-the-master-of-suspense-2/ |title=St. Patrick's Day 2005: The Master of Suspense |work=Irish Echo |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023358/https://www.irishecho.com/2011/02/st-patricks-day-2005-the-master-of-suspense-2/|archive-date=15 February 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; William was a greengrocer as his father had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a large extended family, including Uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road, [[Putney]], complete with maid, cook, chauffeur and gardener. Every summer John rented a seaside house for the family in [[Cliftonville]], Kent. Hitchcock said that he first became class-conscious there, noticing the differences between tourists and locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing himself as a well-behaved boy—his father called him his "little lamb without a spot"—Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=25}} One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes, saying, "This is what we do to naughty boys." The experience left him, he said, with a lifelong fear of policemen; in 1973 he told [[Tom Snyder]] that he was "scared stiff of anything&amp;nbsp;... to do with the law" and wouldn't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket.&lt;ref&gt;For the police story: {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=25}}; [[Dick Cavett|Cavett, Dick]] (8 June 1972).

When he was six, the family moved to [[Limehouse]] and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane, which they ran as a [[fish and chips|fish-and-chips]] shop and fishmongers' respectively; they lived above the former.&lt;ref name=McG2003p13&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock attended his first school, the Howrah House Convent in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], which he entered in 1907, at age 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], he stayed at Howrah House for at most two years. He also attended a convent school, the Wode Street School "for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys", run by the [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]]. He then attended a primary school near his home and was for a short time a boarder at [[Salesian College, Battersea|Salesian College]] in [[Battersea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=29}}; {{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While biographer Gene Adair reports that Hitchcock was "an average, or slightly above-average, pupil",{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}} Hitchcock said that he was "usually among the four or five at the top of the class";{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} at the end of his first year, his work in Latin, English, French and [[religious education]] was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favourite subject was [[geography]], and he became interested in maps, and railway and bus timetables; according to [[John Russell Taylor]], he could recite all the stops on the [[Orient Express]].{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=31}} He told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]: "The Jesuits taught me organisation, control and, to some degree, analysis."{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}}&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

====Henley's====
Hitchcock told his parents that he wanted to be an engineer,{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} and on 25 July 1913,&lt;ref name=Spoto1999p23&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left St Ignatius and enrolled in night classes at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar. In a [[Hitchcock/Truffaut|book-length interview]] in 1962, he told [[François Truffaut]] that he had studied "mechanics, electricity, acoustics, and navigation".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} Then on 12 December 1914 his father, who had been suffering from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] and kidney disease, died at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support himself and his mother—his older siblings had left home by then—Hitchcock took a job, for 15 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] a week (£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|0.75|1914}}}} in 2017),{{inflation-fn|UK}} as a technical clerk at the [[William Thomas Henley|Henley Telegraph and Cable Company]] in Blomfield Street near [[London Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued night classes, this time in art history, painting, economics, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother ran the family shops, while he and his mother continued to live in Salmon Lane.{{sfn|Ackroyd|2015|p=11}}

Hitchcock was too young to enlist when the [[First World War]] started in July 1914, and when he reached the required age of 18 in 1917, he received a C3 classification ("free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home&amp;nbsp;... only suitable for sedentary work").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=27–28}};&lt;!--check page--&gt; [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1918-06-20/debates/3ec12ba9-4d13-4c03-880a-226006f28d83/MilitaryService(MedicalGrading) "Military service (medical grading")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224062439/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1918-06-20/debates/3ec12ba9-4d13-4c03-880a-226006f28d83/MilitaryService(MedicalGrading) |date=24 February 2019 }}, ''Hansard'', vol. 107, 20 June 1918, 607–642.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a cadet regiment of the [[Royal Engineers]] and took part in theoretical briefings, weekend drills, and exercises. John Russell Taylor wrote that, in one session of practical exercises in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], Hitchcock was required to wear [[puttees]]. He could never master wrapping them around his legs, and they repeatedly fell down around his ankles.{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=28}}

After the war, Hitchcock took an interest in creative writing.

===Inter-war career: 1919–1939===
====Famous Players-Lasky====

While still at Henley's, he read in a trade paper that [[Famous Players-Lasky]], the production arm of [[Paramount Pictures]], was opening a studio in London.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=27}} They were planning to film ''[[The Sorrows of Satan]]'' by [[Marie Corelli]], so he produced some drawings for the [[Intertitle|title cards]] and sent his work to the studio.{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=24}} They hired him, and in 1919 he began working for [[Islington Studios]] in Poole Street, [[Hoxton]], as a title-card designer.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=27}}

Donald Spoto wrote that most of the staff were Americans with strict job specifications, but the English workers were encouraged to try their hand at anything, which meant that Hitchcock gained experience as a co-writer, art director and production manager on at least 18 silent films.{{sfn|Spoto|2008|p=3}} ''The Times'' wrote in February 1922 about the studio's "special art title department under the supervision of Mr. A.

====Gainsborough Pictures and work in Germany====

When Paramount pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock was hired as an assistant director by a new firm run in the same location by [[Michael Balcon]], later known as [[Gainsborough Pictures]].{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=27}}{{sfn|Spoto|2008|pp=3–4}} Hitchcock worked on ''[[Woman to Woman (1923 film)|Woman to Woman]]'' (1923) with the director [[Graham Cutts]], designing the set, writing the script and producing. He said: "It was the first film that I had really got my hands onto."{{sfn|Spoto|2008|pp=3–4}} The editor and "script girl" on ''Woman to Woman'' was [[Alma Reville]], his future wife. He also worked as an assistant to Cutts on ''[[The White Shadow (film)|The White Shadow]]'' (1924), ''[[The Passionate Adventure]]'' (1924), ''[[The Blackguard]]'' (1925), and ''[[The Prude's Fall]]'' (1925).{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=30}} ''The Blackguard'' was produced at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in Potsdam, where Hitchcock watched part of the making of [[F. W. Murnau]]'s film ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|The Last Laugh]]'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2002|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|pp=157–158}}; also see {{harvnb|Garncarz|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was impressed with Murnau's work and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2002|pp=42–43}}

In the summer of 1925, Balcon asked Hitchcock to direct ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925), starring [[Virginia Valli]], a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm [[Emelka]] at the [[Bavaria Studios|Geiselgasteig studio]] near Munich. Reville, by then Hitchcock's fiancée, was assistant director-editor.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=31, 36}}{{sfn|Spoto|1992|p=3}} Although the film was a commercial flop,{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=68–71}} Balcon liked Hitchcock's work; a ''Daily Express'' headline called him the "Young man with a master mind".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=39}} Production of ''The Pleasure Garden'' encountered obstacles which Hitchcock would later learn from: on arrival to [[Brenner Pass]], he failed to declare his [[film stock]] to customs and it was confiscated; one actress could not enter the water for a scene because she was on her [[Menstrual cycle|period]]; budget overruns meant that he had to borrow money from the actors.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=70}} Hitchcock also needed a translator to give instructions to the cast and crew.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=70}}

In Germany, Hitchcock observed the nuances of [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]] and filmmaking which had a big influence on him.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=63}} When he was not working, he would visit Berlin's art galleries, concerts and museums. He would also meet with actors, writers, and producers to build connections.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=64}} Balcon asked him to direct a second film in Munich, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'' (1926), based on an original story titled ''Fear o' God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-mountain-eagle-1926 |title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Mountain Eagle (1926) |publisher=Brenton Film |access-date=30 August 2019 |date=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219011242/https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-mountain-eagle-1926|archive-date=19 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is lost, and Hitchcock called it "a very bad movie".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=39}}{{sfn|Spoto|1992|p=5}} A year later, Hitchcock wrote and directed ''[[The Ring (1927 film)|The Ring]]''; although the screenplay was credited solely to his name, [[Eliot Stannard|Elliot Stannard]] assisted him with the writing.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=98}} ''The Ring'' garnered positive reviews; the ''Bioscope'' magazine critic called it "the most magnificent British film ever made".{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=76}}

When he returned to England, Hitchcock was one of the early members of the London Film Society, newly formed in 1925.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=75}} Through the Society, he became fascinated by the work by Soviet filmmakers: [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Lev Kuleshov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. He would also socialise with fellow English filmmakers [[Ivor Montagu]] and [[Adrian Brunel]], and [[Walter C. Mycroft]].{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=76}}

Hitchcock's luck came with his first thriller, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), about the hunt for a serial killer, wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag, is murdering young blonde women in London, and only on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=45}} A landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer, but he turns out to be innocent. To convey the impression footsteps were being heard from an upper floor, Hitchcock had a glass floor made so that the viewer could see the lodger pacing up and down in his room above the landlady.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=47}} Hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty, or for the film at least to end ambiguously, but the star was [[Ivor Novello]], a [[matinée idol]], and the "[[star system (filmmaking)|star system]]" meant that Novello could not be the villain. Hitchcock told Truffaut: "You have to clearly spell it out in big letters: 'He is innocent.'" (He had the same problem years later with [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[#Suspicion|Suspicion]]'' (1941).){{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=43}} Released in January 1927, ''The Lodger'' was a commercial and critical success in the UK.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapsis|1992|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock told Truffaut that the film was the first of his to be influenced by [[German Expressionism]]: "In truth, you might almost say that ''The Lodger'' was my first picture."{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=44}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 edition; is the date correct? --&gt; He made his first [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] appearances in the film; he was depicted sitting in a newsroom, and in the second, standing in a crowd as the leading man is arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-1926 |title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1926) |publisher=Brenton Film |access-date=30 August 2019 |date=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222033129/https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-1926|archive-date=22 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=49}}

On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married the English-American screenwriter [[Alma Reville]] (1899–1982) at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Brompton Oratory]] in [[South Kensington]].{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=5}} The couple honeymooned in Paris, [[Lake Como]] and St. Moritz, before returning to London to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of 153 [[Cromwell Road]], Kensington.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=89–90}} Reville, who was born just hours after Hitchcock,{{sfn|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=15}} converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, apparently at the insistence of Hitchcock's mother; she was baptised on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at [[Westminster Cathedral]] by Cardinal [[Francis Bourne]] on 5 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, when they learned that Reville was pregnant, the Hitchcocks purchased "Winter's Grace", a [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] farmhouse set in 11 acres on Stroud Lane, [[Wonersh#Shamley Green|Shamley Green]], Surrey, for £2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=55}}; {{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Ross |title=Alfred Hitchcock: A long way from the Bates Motel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/period-property/3360983/Alfred-Hitchcock-A-long-way-from-the-Bates-Motel.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 April 2008|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227193225/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/period-property/3360983/Alfred-Hitchcock-A-long-way-from-the-Bates-Motel.html|archive-date=27 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter and only child, [[Patricia Hitchcock|Patricia Alma Hitchcock]], was born on 7 July that year.{{sfn|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|pp=59–60}}

In 1933 Hitchcock signed a multi-film contract with [[Gaumont-British]], once again working for Michael Balcon.{{Sfn|Spoto|1999|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=153}} His first film for the company, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), was a success; his second, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), was acclaimed in the UK and gained him recognition in the United States. It also established the quintessential English "Hitchcock blonde" ([[Madeleine Carroll]]) as the template for his succession of ice-cold, elegant leading ladies.

[[File:Hitchcocks-Joan-Harrison-1937.jpg|thumb|[[Alma Reville]], [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], Hitchcock, and [[Patricia Hitchcock]], 24 August 1937]]

Hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936. ''[[Sabotage (1936 film)|Sabotage]]'' was loosely based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel, ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907), about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist, and ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'', based on two stories in ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'' (1928) by [[W.

At this time, Hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew. These jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal. For instance, he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because he claimed there weren't enough blue foods. He also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend, actor [[Gerald du Maurier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/ |title=Alfred Hitchcock: a sadistic prankster |last=Chilton |first=Martin |date=29 April 2016 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=9 January 2019 |issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110014406/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock followed up with ''[[Young and Innocent]]'' in 1937, a crime thriller based on the 1936 novel ''[[A Shilling for Candles]]'' by [[Josephine Tey]].{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=137}} Starring [[Nova Pilbeam]] and [[Derrick De Marney]], the film was relatively enjoyable for the cast and crew to make.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=137}} To meet distribution purposes in America, the film's runtime was cut and this included removal of one of Hitchcock's favourite scenes: a children's tea party which becomes menacing to the protagonists.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=138}}

Hitchcock's next major success was ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), "one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era", according to [[Philip French]], in which Miss Froy ([[May Whitty]]), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/24/my-favourite-hitchcock-lady-vanishes |title=My favourite Hitchcock: The Lady Vanishes |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 July 2012|access-date=10 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209074800/https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/24/my-favourite-hitchcock-lady-vanishes|archive-date=9 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film saw Hitchcock receive the [[1938 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|1938 New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lady Vanishes |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80706/The-Lady-Vanishes/ |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711175302/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80706/The-Lady-Vanishes/ |archive-date=11 July 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Crisler of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' wrote in June 1938: "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: [[Magna Carta]], the [[Tower Bridge]] and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crisler |first1=B.

By 1938 Hitchcock was aware that he had reached his peak in Britain.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=140}} He had received numerous offers from producers in the United States, but he turned them all down because he disliked the contractual obligations or thought the projects were repellent.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=141}} However, producer [[David O. Selznick]] offered him a concrete proposal to make a film based on the sinking of [[Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], which was eventually shelved, but Selznick persuaded Hitchcock to come to [[Hollywood]]. In July 1938, Hitchcock flew to New York, and found that he was already a celebrity; he was featured in magazines and gave interviews to radio stations.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=142}} In Hollywood, Hitchcock met Selznick for the first time. Selznick offered him a four-film contract, approximately $40,000 for each picture ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1938|fmt=eq}}).{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=142}}

===Early Hollywood years: 1939–1945===
====Selznick contract====
Selznick signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in April 1939,{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=121}} and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hitchcocks lived in a spacious flat on [[Wilshire Boulevard]], and slowly acclimatised themselves to the Los Angeles area. He and his wife Alma kept a low profile, and were not interested in attending parties or being celebrities.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=153}} Hitchcock discovered his taste for fine food in West Hollywood, but still carried on his way of life from England.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=154}} He was impressed with Hollywood's filmmaking culture, expansive budgets and efficiency,{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=154}} compared to the limits that he had often faced in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June that year, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine called him the "greatest master of melodrama in screen history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date=19 June 1939 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b0kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 66] |title=Alfred Hitchcock: England's Best Director starts work in Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hitchcock and Selznick respected each other, their working arrangements were sometimes difficult. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often unhappy about Selznick's creative control and interference over his films. Selznick was also displeased with Hitchcock's method of shooting just what was in the script, and nothing more, which meant that the film could not be cut and remade differently at a later time.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=152}} As well as complaining about Hitchcock's "goddamn jigsaw cutting",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; their personalities were mismatched: Hitchcock was reserved whereas Selznick was flamboyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Billheimer|first=John|chapter=Hitchcock and Selznick|date=1 May 2019|chapter-url=http://kentucky.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5810/kentucky/9780813177427.001.0001/upso-9780813177427-chapter-006|title=Hitchcock and the Censors|pages=59–63|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|doi=10.5810/kentucky/9780813177427.003.0006|isbn=978-0-8131-7742-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Selznick generously lent Hitchcock to the larger film studios.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=145}} Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. In a later interview, Hitchcock said: "[Selznick] was the Big Producer.&amp;nbsp;... Producer was king. The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me—and it shows you the amount of control—he said I was the 'only director' he'd 'trust with a film'."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rebecca (1940) - Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''Rebecca'' (1940)]]

Hitchcock approached American cinema cautiously; his first American film was set in England in which the "Americanness" of the characters was incidental:{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=240}} ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940) was set in a Hollywood version of England's Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]]. Selznick insisted on a faithful adaptation of the book, and disagreed with Hitchcock with the use of humour.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=150}}{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=155}} The film, starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]], concerns an unnamed naïve young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. She lives in his large [[English country house]], and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[13th Academy Awards]]; the statuette was given to producer Selznick. Hitchcock received his first nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], his first of five such nominations.&lt;ref name=Rebecca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1941 |title=The 13th Academy Awards, 1941 |access-date=30 December 2017 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303110034/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/13th-winners.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's second American film was the thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), set in Europe, based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s book ''Personal History'' (1935) and produced by [[Walter Wanger]]. It was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while Britain was at [[World War II|war]]; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed in 1939, it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by [[Joel McCrea]]. By mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood [[backlot]], the film avoided direct references to [[Nazism]], [[Nazi Germany]], and Germans, to comply with the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

====Early war years====
In September 1940 the Hitchcocks bought the {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} Cornwall Ranch near [[Scotts Valley]], California, in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.scottsvalleychamber.com/history/history/hitchcock.htm |title=Alfred Hitchcock Found Contentment in SV |first=Marion |last=Pokriots |publisher=Scotts Valley Historical Society |access-date=31 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100444/http://history.scottsvalleychamber.com/history/history/hitchcock.htm|archive-date=1 January 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary residence was an English-style home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], purchased in 1942.&lt;ref name="Variety obituary"/&gt; Hitchcock's films were diverse during this period, ranging from the romantic comedy ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) to the bleak [[film noir]] ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).

[[File:Cary Grant Joan Fontaine Suspicion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] in a publicity shot for ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941)]]
{{anchor|Suspicion}}''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer and director. It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four in which [[Cary Grant]] was cast by Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant plays a sinister character. Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English [[Confidence trick|conman]] whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw ([[Joan Fontaine]]).{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=434–435}} In one scene, Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; the light ensures that the audience's attention is on the glass. Grant's character is actually a killer, as per written in the book, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142–143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: "They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer. So there was no film existing at all. That was ridiculous. Nevertheless, I had to compromise on the end. What I wanted to do was that the wife was aware that she was going to be murdered by her husband, so she wrote a letter to her mother saying that she was very much in love with him, she didn't want live anymore, she was going to be killed but society should be protected. She therefore brings up this fatal glass of milk, drinks it and before she does she says, "Will you mail this letter to mother?" Then she drinks the milk and dies. You then have just one final scene of a cheerful Cary Grant going to the mailbox and posting the letter.&amp;nbsp;... But this was never permitted because of the basic error in casting."&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes/&gt;}} Fontaine won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Luther |first1=Claudia |title=Joan Fontaine, actress who won Oscar for 'Suspicion,' dies at 96 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-joan-fontaine-actress-who-won-oscar-for-suspicion-dies-at-96-20131215 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=15 December 2013|access-date=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327063921/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-joan-fontaine-actress-who-won-oscar-for-suspicion-dies-at-96-20131215|archive-date=27 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] during the decade. Hitchcock was forced by Universal to use Universal contract player [[Robert Cummings]] and [[Priscilla Lane]], a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with the studio, both known for their work in comedies and light dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|1994|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story depicts a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur ([[Norman Lloyd]]) atop the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Hitchcock took a three-day tour of New York City to scout for ''Saboteur''{{'}}s filming locations.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=445}} He also directed ''Have You Heard?'' (1942), a photographic dramatisation for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine of the [[Loose lips sink ships|dangers of rumours during wartime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title="Have You Heard?": The Story of Wartime Rumors |date=13 July 1942 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3E0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;pg=PA68 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he wrote a mystery story for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, "The Murder of [[Monty Woolley]]",{{sfn|Brunsdale|2010|p=442}} a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to find clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves, such as Woolley, Doris Merrick, and make-up man Guy Pearce.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Back in England, Hitchcock's mother Emma was severely ill; she died on 26 September 1942 at age 79. Hitchcock never spoke publicly about his mother, but his assistant said that he admired her.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=321}} Four months later, on 4 January 1943, his brother William died of an overdose at age 52.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=325}} Hitchcock was not very close to William,{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=193}} but his death made Hitchcock conscious about his own eating and drinking habits. He was overweight and suffering from back aches. His New Year's resolution in 1943 was to take his diet seriously with the help of a physician.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=326}} In January that year, ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' was released, which Hitchcock had fond memories of making.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=327}} In the film, Charlotte "Charlie" Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]) suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of being a serial killer.

At [[20th Century Fox]], Hitchcock approached [[John Steinbeck]] with an idea for a film, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German [[U-boat]] attack. Steinbeck began work on the script which would become the ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance; it was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for "Reduco-Obesity Slayer".&lt;ref name="Spoto1999p267"&gt;The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). See {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=267}}, and Rhys, Morgan T. (20 September 2012). "Every Alfred Hitchcock Cameo".

{{quote|At the time, I was on a strenuous diet, painfully working my way from three hundred to two hundred pounds. So I decided to immortalize my loss and get my bit part by posing for "before" and "after" pictures.&amp;nbsp;... I was literally submerged by letters from fat people who wanted to know where and how they could get Reduco.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=158–159}}}}

Hitchcock's typical dinner before his weight loss had been a roast chicken, boiled ham, potatoes, bread, vegetables, relishes, salad, dessert, a bottle of wine and some brandy. To lose weight, his diet consisted of black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and steak and salad for dinner,{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=326}} but it was hard to maintain; Donald Spoto wrote that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years. At the end of 1943, despite the weight loss, the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused his application for life insurance.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=266–267}}

Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short [[propaganda film]]s, ''[[Bon Voyage (1944 film)|Bon Voyage]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aventure Malgache]]'' (1944), for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. In June and July 1945, Hitchcock served as "treatment advisor" on a [[Holocaust]] documentary that used [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] footage of the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The film was assembled in London and produced by [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on board. It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the [[British War Office]] film vaults to London's [[Imperial War Museum]] and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it: ''Memory of the Camps''. The full-length version of the film, ''[[German Concentration Camps Factual Survey]]'', was restored in 2014 by scholars at the Imperial War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeffries9Jan2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jeffries |first1=Stuart |title=The Holocaust film that was too shocking to show |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock |work=The Guardian |date=9 January 2015 |access-date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110022047/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock|archive-date=10 January 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memory of the Camps: Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html |publisher=PBS |access-date=6 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222140552/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html|archive-date=22 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock worked for David Selznick again when he directed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), which explores [[psychoanalysis]] and features a [[dream sequence]] designed by [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyd |first=David |title=The Parted Eye: ''Spellbound'' and Psychoanalysis |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |year=2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224214107/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |archive-date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned; Selznick edited it to make it "play" more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1987|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Peck]] plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past.{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=408–412}} Two [[Point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film.

&lt;!--mention ''The Paradine Case'' (1947) and the Motion Picture Production Code--&gt;The spy film ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' was followed next in 1946. Hitchcock told François Truffaut that Selznick sold him, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and [[Ben Hecht]]'s screenplay, to RKO Radio Pictures as a "package" for $500,000 ({{Inflation|US|500,000|1946|fmt=eq}}) because of cost overruns on Selznick's ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''Notorious'' stars Bergman and Grant, both Hitchcock collaborators, and features a plot about Nazis, [[uranium]] and South America. His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=168}} According to Patrick McGilligan, in or around March 1945, Hitchcock and Hecht consulted [[Robert Millikan]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] about the development of a uranium bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was "science fiction", only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in Japan in August 1945.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=370–371}}

====Transatlantic Pictures====

Hitchcock formed an independent production company, [[Transatlantic Pictures]], with his friend [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]]. He made two films with Transatlantic, one of which was his first colour film. With ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''Lifeboat''. The film appears as a very limited number of continuous shots, but it was actually shot in 10 ranging from 4-{{frac|2}} to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. The film features [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock. It was inspired by the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=421}} Critical response at the time was mixed.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=}}

''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in 19th-century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used [[Technicolor]] in this production, then returned to [[Black and white|black-and-white]] for several years. Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after the last two films.{{Sfn|Spoto|1999|p=138}}{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=179}} Hitchcock filmed ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950) at [[Elstree Studios|Elstree]] studios in England, where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2001|pp=62, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paired one of [[Warner Bros.]]' most popular stars, [[Jane Wyman]], with the expatriate German actor [[Marlene Dietrich]] and used several prominent British actors, including [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]], [[Richard Todd]] and [[Alastair Sim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|Lasky|2002|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Hitchcock's first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 429, 774–775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Mention that, after falling out with Raymond Chandler, Hitchcock hired Czenzi Ormonde to work with Barbara Keon and Alma Reville; say more about the film, "crisscross", and murder in spectacles scene--&gt;His thriller ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) was based on the [[Strangers on a Train (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Patricia Highsmith]]. Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached [[Dashiell Hammett]] to write the dialogue, but [[Raymond Chandler]] took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. [[Farley Granger]]'s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]], previously known for "boy-next-door" roles, played the villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=320, 322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) was set in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] with [[Montgomery Clift]] as a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/I-Confess/notes.html |title=Notes: ''I Confess'' (1953) |publisher=TCM |access-date=15 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122032808/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/I-Confess/notes.html | archive-date=22 November 2018 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak years: 1954–1964===
====''Dial M for Murder'' and ''Rear Window''====
[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Still image from the film Read Window featuring Stewart and Kelly|[[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954)]]
''I Confess'' was followed by three colour films starring [[Grace Kelly]]: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955). In ''Dial M for Murder'', [[Ray Milland]] plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like murder. Her lover, Mark Halliday ([[Robert Cummings]]), and Police Inspector Hubbard ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]) save her from execution.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 78-80"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock experimented with [[3-D film|3D cinematography]] for ''Dial M for Murder''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=French |first1=Philip |title=Dial M for Murder 3D – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/dial-m-for-murder-3d-review |work=The Observer |date=28 July 2013|access-date=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722232944/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/dial-m-for-murder-3d-review|archive-date=22 July 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--when did he move to Paramount? — Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, The Trouble with Harry (1955), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960)--&gt;Hitchcock moved to [[Paramount Pictures]] and filmed ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Stewart's character is a photographer called Jeff (based on [[Robert Capa]]) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Jeff eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) and his girlfriend (Kelly). As with ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case Stewart's studio apartment. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions, "from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Alfred Hitchcock Presents''====

&lt;!--CBS, 30 minutes weekly, $129,000 per episode; 1958, Golden Globe for best television series; see Evans--&gt;From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host of the television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.&lt;ref name="Alfred Hitchcock Presents"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents |publisher=TV.COM |url=http://www.tv.com/alfred-hitchcock-presents/show/238/summary.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125154314/http://www.tv.com/alfred-hitchcock-presents/show/238/summary.html |archive-date=25 January 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his droll delivery, gallows humour and iconic image, the series made Hitchcock a celebrity. The title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=TV in the USA: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-4408-2972-7 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series theme tune was ''Funeral March of a Marionette'' by the French composer [[Charles Gounod]] (1818–1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock (suspense anthology) |publisher=Media Management Group |url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221144330/http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html |archive-date=21 February 2008|url-status=dead |access-date=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one [[electric chair]], while two are shown with a sign "Two chairs—no waiting!" He directed 18 episodes of the series, which aired from 1955 to 1965. It became ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1962, and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965. In the 1980s, a [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|new version]] of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a [[colourised]] form.&lt;ref name="Alfred Hitchcock Presents"/&gt;

Hitchcock's success in television spawned a set of short-story collections in his name; these included ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology]]'', ''Stories They Wouldn't Let Me Do on TV,'' and ''Tales My Mother Never Told Me''.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=202}} In 1956 HSD Publications also licensed the director's name to create ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'', a monthly [[Digest size|digest]] specialising in crime and detective fiction.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=202}} Hitchcock's television series' were very profitable, and his foreign-language versions of books were bringing revenues of up to $100,000 a year ({{Inflation|US|100,000|1960|fmt=eq}}).{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=203}}&lt;!--making this invisible for now; not sure where to place it: Hitchcock also appears as a character in the juvenile detective book series, ''[[Three Investigators|Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators]]''. The long-running series was created by [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]], who wrote the first few books. The Three Investigators—Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw—were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In the introduction to each book, "Alfred Hitchcock" introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve. At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case.&lt;ref name="Alfred Hitchcock Presents"/&gt;--&gt;

====From ''To Catch a Thief'' to ''Vertigo''====
In 1955 Hitchcock became a United States citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p= 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, his third Grace Kelly film, ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', was released; it is set in the [[French Riviera]], and stars Kelly and Cary Grant. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him. "Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 366"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly; she married [[Prince Rainier]] of Monaco in 1956, and ended her film career afterward. Hitchcock then remade his own [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|1934 film]] ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|in 1956]]. This time, the film starred James Stewart and [[Doris Day]], who sang the theme song "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera, Sera]]", which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and became a big hit. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1994|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of [[mistaken identity]] reported in ''Life'' magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star [[Henry Fonda]], playing a [[Stork Club]] musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife ([[Vera Miles]]) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 377"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--1957, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], first book-length study of his work--&gt;&lt;!--moved this from the "relationship with actors" section: In the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially Truffaut, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the filmmaking process.&lt;ref name="Moerbeek2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Moerbeek|2006|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}--&gt;[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Kim Novak at Golden Gate Bridge Fort Point.jpg|thumb|alt=Still image from the film Vertigo|[[Kim Novak]] by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958){{efn|A 2012 [[British Film Institute]] poll ranked ''Vertigo'' as the [[Sight &amp; Sound#2012|greatest film ever made]].&lt;ref name=Christie2012&gt;{{cite news |last=Christie |first=Ian |title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |work=Sight &amp; Sound |date=September 2012 |access-date=29 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301135739/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|archive-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live}}; also see {{cite news |title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |publisher=British Film Institute |year=2012|access-date=29 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207035347/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics|archive-date=7 February 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]

While directing episodes for ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the summer of 1957, Hitchcock was admitted to hospital for [[hernia]] and [[gallstone]]s, and had to have his [[gallbladder]] removed. Following a successful surgery, he immediately returned to work to prepare for his next project.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=212}}{{Sfn|Evans|2004|p=}} Hitchcock's next film, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) again starred James Stewart, with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. He had wanted [[Vera Miles]] to play the lead, but she was pregnant. He told [[Oriana Fallaci]]: "I was offering her a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress. We'd have spent a heap of dollars on it, and she has the bad taste to get pregnant. I hate pregnant women, because then they have children."{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}

In ''Vertigo'', Stewart plays Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including Donald Spoto and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''Vertigo'' is the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]''-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death, than any other work in his filmography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kehr|2011|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vertigo'' contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts, commonly referred to as a [[dolly zoom]], which has been copied by many filmmakers. The film premiered at the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], and Hitchcock won the Silver Seashell prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Sebastian Film Festival|url=https://www.sansebastianfestival.com:443/1958/awards_and_jury_members/awards/1/51/in|access-date=19 November 2020|website=San Sebastian Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vertigo'' is considered a classic, but it attracted mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts at the time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravetto-Biagioli|first1=Kriss|last2=Beugnet|first2=Martine|date=27 September 2019|title=Vertiginous Hauntings: The Ghosts of Vertigo|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/film.2019.0114|journal=Film-Philosophy|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227–246|doi=10.3366/film.2019.0114|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; the critic from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine opined that the film was "too slow and too long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=14 May 1958|title=Vertigo|url=https://variety.com/1958/film/reviews/vertigo-2-1200419207/|access-date=19 November 2020|website=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]] of the ''New York Times'' thought it was "devilishly far-fetched", but praised the cast performances and Hitchcock's direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=29 May 1958|title=Vertigo,' Hitchcock's Latest; Melodrama Arrives at the Capitol (Published 1958)|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/05/29/archives/vertigo-hitchcocks-latest-melodrama-arrives-at-the-capitol.html|access-date=19 November 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was also the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 376-77"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls, it ranked just behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941); ten years later, in the same magazine, critics chose it as the best film ever made.&lt;ref name="Christie2012" /&gt;

====''North by Northwest'' and ''Psycho''====
{{see also|Psycho (franchise)}}
After ''Vertigo'', the rest of 1958 had been a difficult year for Hitchcock. During [[pre-production]] of ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), which was a "slow" and "agonising" process, his wife Alma was diagnosed with cancer.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=217}} While Alma was in hospital, Hitchcock kept himself occupied with his television work and would visit her everyday. Alma underwent surgery and made a full recovery but it caused Hitchcock to imagine, for the first time, life without her.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=217}}

Hitchcock followed up with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among his best: ''North by Northwest'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''North by Northwest'', Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a [[Madison Avenue]] advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. He is hotly pursued across the United States by enemy agents, including Eve Kendall ([[Eva Marie Saint]]). At first, Thornhill believes Kendall is helping him, but then realises that she is an enemy agent; he  learns that she is working undercover for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. During its opening two-week run at [[Radio City Music Hall]], the film grossed $404,056 ({{Inflation|US|404,056|1959|fmt=eq}}), setting a record in that theatre's non-holiday gross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,864921,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530114819/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,864921,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=Box Office: For the Books |date=31 August 1959 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the film "smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,937893,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures |date=17 August 1959 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}{{pb}}

====Truffaut interview====
{{further|Hitchcock/Truffaut|Hitchcock/Truffaut (film)}}
&lt;!--expand--&gt;On 13 August 1962, Hitchcock's 63rd birthday, the French director [[François Truffaut]] began a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions. It took four years to transcribe the tapes and organise the images; it was published as a book in 1967, which Truffaut nicknamed the "Hitchbook". The audio tapes were used as the basis of a documentary in 2015.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jeffries |first1=Stuart |title='Actors are cattle': when Hitchcock met Truffaut |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/when-hitchcock-met-truffaut-hitchcock-truffaut-documentary-cannes |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2015|access-date=16 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131315/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/when-hitchcock-met-truffaut-hitchcock-truffaut-documentary-cannes|archive-date=17 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that Hitchcock was not simply the mass-market entertainer the American media made him out to be. It was obvious from his films, Truffaut wrote, that Hitchcock had "given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues". He compared the interview to "Oedipus' consultation of the oracle".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=11–12}}

====''Marnie''====
[[File:Marnie (1964) trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964)]]

In June 1962, Grace Kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964).&lt;!--explain why?--&gt; Hedren had signed an exclusive seven-year, $500-a-week contract with Hitchcock in October 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=270}};

In 2016, describing Hedren's performance as "one of the greatest in the history of cinema", [[Richard Brody]] called the film a "story of sexual violence" inflicted on the character played by Hedren: "The film is, to put it simply, sick, and it's so because Hitchcock was sick. He suffered all his life from furious sexual desire, suffered from the lack of its gratification, suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality, and then went ahead and did so virtually, by way of his art."&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brody |first1=Richard|author-link=Richard Brody |title="Marnie" Is the Cure for Hitchcock Mania |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania |work=The New Yorker |date=17 August 2016|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072926/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}

In the film, Marnie Edgar (Hedren) steals $10,000 from her employer and goes on the run. She applies for a job at Mark Rutland's (Connery) company in Philadelphia and steals from there too. Earlier she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red. Mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him. She explains that she does not want to be touched, but during the "honeymoon", Mark rapes her. Marnie and Mark discover that Marnie's mother had been a prostitute when Marnie was a child, and that, while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm—the mother believed the client had tried to molest Marnie—Marnie had killed the client to save her mother. Cured of her fears when she remembers what happened, she decides to stay with Mark.&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaver13Aug2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cleaver |first1=Emily |title=My favourite Hitchcock: Marnie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/13/my-favourite-hitchcock-marnie |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2012|access-date=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227122740/https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/13/my-favourite-hitchcock-marnie|archive-date=27 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock told cinematographer [[Robert Burks]] that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to Hedren when he filmed her face.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=471}} [[Ed McBain|Evan Hunter]], the screenwriter of ''The Birds'' who was writing ''Marnie'' too, explained to Hitchcock that, if Mark loved Marnie, he would comfort her, not rape her.

===Later years: 1966–1980===
====Final films====
Failing health reduced Hitchcock's output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer [[Stephen Rebello]] claimed Universal imposed two films on him, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966) and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969), the latter of which is based on a [[Leon Uris]] novel, partly set in Cuba.{{Sfn|Rebello|1990|p=188}} Both were spy thrillers with [[Cold War]]-related themes. ''Torn Curtain'', with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Julie Andrews]], precipitated the bitter end of the 12-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|pp=272–274}}; {{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Andrew |title=The sound of Hitchcock: How Bernard Herrmann's music brought his films to life |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 January 2016|access-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319215055/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html|archive-date=19 March 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock was unhappy with Herrmann's score and replaced him with [[John Addison]], [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|pp=273–274}} Upon release, ''Torn Curtain'' was a box office failure,{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=328}} and ''Topaz'' was disliked by critics and the studio.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=333}}

Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his penultimate film, ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), based on the novel ''[[Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square]]'' (1966). After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the "Necktie Murders", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites as in ''Strangers on a Train''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Frenzy'', Hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time. Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled;{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=}} Donald Spoto called the latter "one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film". Both actors, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] and [[Anna Massey]], refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=513–514}} Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the head of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Hitchcock would add subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such material and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's "inescapable inferences".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of "Madam" Blanche Tyler, played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi-driver lover [[Bruce Dern]], making a living from her phony powers. While ''Family Plot'' was based on the [[Victor Canning]] novel ''[[The Rainbird Pattern]]'' (1972), the novel's tone is more sinister. Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] originally wrote the film, under the working title Deception, with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock where it took the name Deceit, then finally, Family Plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollenback|first=Sharon Sue Rountree|title=Analysis Of Processes Involved In Screenwriting As Demonstrated In Screenplays By Ernest Lehman|publisher=Ann Arbor|year=1980|isbn=9798644965205|location=United States|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Knighthood and death====
&lt;!--add American Film Institute Life Achievement Award and speech about his wife--&gt;[[File:Alfred Hitchcock by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|c.1972 by [[Jack Mitchell (photographer)|Jack Mitchell]]]] Toward the end of his life, Hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with [[James Costigan]], [[Ernest Lehman]] and [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Despite preliminary work, it was never filmed. Hitchcock's health was declining and he was worried about his wife, who had suffered a stroke.

[[File:Caméo - Une femme disparaît.jpg|thumb|Hitchcock's cameo appearance in ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938)|alt=Still from ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' depicting Hitchcock]]
Hitchcock's film production career evolved from small-scale silent films to financially significant sound films. Hitchock remarked that he was influenced by early filmmakers George Méliès, D.W. Griffith and Alice Guy-Blaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chandler|first=Charlotte|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62897583|title=It's only a movie : Alfred Hitchcock : a personal biography|date=2006|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=1-55783-692-2|location=New York|oclc=62897583}}&lt;/ref&gt; His silent films between 1925 and 1929 were in the crime and suspense genres, but also included melodramas and comedies. Whilst [[Visual narrative|visual storytelling]] was pertinent during the silent era, even after the arrival of sound, Hitchcock still relied on visuals in cinema. In Britain, he honed his craft so that by the time he moved to Hollywood, the director had perfected his style and camera techniques. Hitchcock later said that his British work was the "sensation of cinema", whereas the American phase was when his "ideas were fertilised".{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=123}} Scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] writes that the director's first two films, ''The Pleasure Garden'' and ''The Mountain Eagle'', were influenced by [[German Expressionism]]. Afterward, he discovered [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet cinema]], and [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s theories of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]].{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=75}} 1926's ''The Lodger'' was inspired by both German and Soviet aesthetics, styles which solidified the rest of his career.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=207}} Although Hitchcock's work in the 1920s found some success, several British reviewers criticised Hitchcock's films for being unoriginal and conceited.{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=17}} [[Raymond Durgnat]] opined that Hitchcock's films were carefully and intelligently constructed, but thought they can be shallow and rarely present a "coherent worldview".{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=400}}

Earning the title "Master of Suspense", the director experimented with ways to generate tension in his work.{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=17}} He said, "My suspense work comes out of creating nightmares for the audience. And I ''play'' with an audience. I make them gasp and surprise them and shock them. When you have a nightmare, it's awfully vivid if you're dreaming that you're being led to the electric chair. Then you're as happy as can be when you wake up because you're relieved."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lightman|first=Herb A.|date=12 June 2017|title=Hitchcock Talks About Lights, Camera, Action - The American Society of Cinematographers|url=https://ascmag.com/articles/flashback-hitchcock-talks-about-lights-camera-action|access-date=25 November 2020|website=ascmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming of ''North by Northwest'', Hitchcock explained his reasons for recreating the set of [[Mount Rushmore]]: "The audience responds in proportion to how realistic you make it. One of the dramatic reasons for this type of photography is to get it looking so natural that the audience gets involved and believes, for the time being, what's going on up there on the screen."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hitchcock's films, from the silent to the sound era, contained a number of recurring themes that he is famous for. His films explored audience as a [[Voyeurism|voyeur]], notably in ''Rear Window'', ''Marnie'' and ''Psycho''. He understood that human beings enjoy voyeuristic activities and made the audience participate in it through the character's actions.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=216}} Of his fifty-three films, eleven revolved around stories of [[mistaken identity]], where an innocent protagonist is accused of a crime and is pursued by police. In most cases, it is an ordinary, everyday person who finds themselves in a dangerous situation.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=48}} Hitchcock told Truffaut: "That's because the theme of the innocent man being accused, I feel, provides the audience with a greater sense of danger. It's easier for them to identify with him than with a guilty man on the run."{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=48}} One of his constant themes were the struggle of a personality torn between "order and chaos";{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=98}} known as the notion of "double", which is a comparison or contrast between two characters or objects: the double representing a dark or evil side.{{Sfn|Evans|2004|p=}}

According to Robin Wood, Hitchcock had mixed feelings towards homosexuality despite working with gay actors in his career.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=342}} Donald Spoto suggests that Hitchcock's [[Sexual repression|sexually repressive]] childhood may have contributed to his exploration of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviancy]].{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=342}} During the 1950s, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] prohibited direct references to homosexuality but the director was known for his subtle references,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hosier|first1=Connie Russell|last2=Badman|first2=Scott|date=7 February 2017|title=Gay Coding in Hitchcock Films|url=https://www.us.mensa.org/read/bulletin/features/gay-coding-in-hitchcock-films/|access-date=25 November 2020|website=American Mensa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pushing the boundaries of the censors. Moreover, ''Shadow of a Doubt'' has a double [[incest]] theme through the storyline, expressed implicitly through images.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=300}} Author Jane Sloan argues that Hitchcock was drawn to both conventional and unconventional sexual expression in his work,{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=16}} and the theme of marriage was usually presented in a "bleak and skeptical" manner.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=246}} It was also not until after his mother's death in 1942, that Hitchcock portrayed motherly figures as "notorious monster-mothers".{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=321}} The [[espionage]] backdrop, and murders committed by characters with [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] tendencies were common themes too.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=128}} In Hitchcock's depiction of villains and murderers, they were usually charming and friendly, forcing viewers to identify with them.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=293}} The director's strict childhood and Jesuit education may have led to his distrust of authoritarian figures such as policemen and politicians; a theme which he has explored.{{Sfn|Evans|2004|p=}} Also, he used the “[[MacGuffin]]”—the use of an object, person or event to keep the plot moving along even if it was non-essential to the story.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=120}} Some examples include the microfilm in ''North by Northwest'' and the $40,000 stolen money in ''Psycho''.

Hitchcock appears briefly in most of his own films. For example, he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train (''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]''), walking dogs out of a pet shop (''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''), fixing a neighbour's clock (''[[Rear Window]]''), as a shadow (''[[Family Plot]]''), sitting at a table in a photograph (''[[Dial M for Murder]]''), and riding a bus (''[[North by Northwest]]'','' [[To Catch a Thief]]'').{{sfn|Walker|2005|p=88}}

"They were blonde. They were icy and remote. They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerised the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958 |title=Vertigo |date=13 October 1996 |work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=26 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223043656/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1967 Hitchcock told Truffaut: "I think the most interesting women, sexually, are the English women.

An English girl, looking like a schoolteacher, is apt to get into a cab with you and, to your surprise, she'll probably pull a man's pants open.&amp;nbsp;...

[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kim Novak]] and [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958)]]
The victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and ''[[Under Capricorn]]''), is dark blonde. In ''Rear Window'', Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''To Catch a Thief'', Francie (also Kelly) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''North by Northwest'' respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 and is murdered by [[Norman Bates]], a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''The Birds''. In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.

His films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as Norman Bates in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'', Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'', the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

Hitchcock became known for having remarked that "actors should be treated like cattle".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}{{efn|Hitchcock told Fallaci in 1963: "When they [actors] aren't cows, they're children: that's something else I've often said. And everyone knows that there are good children, bad children, and stupid children. The majority of actors, though, are stupid children. They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea. His actors are made of paper; when he doesn't like them, he can tear them up."{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}}} During the filming of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941), [[Carole Lombard]] brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise him.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}} In an episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', originally broadcast on 8 June 1972,  [[Dick Cavett]] stated as fact that Hitchcock had once called actors cattle. Hitchcock responded by saying that, at one time, he had been accused of calling actors cattle. “I said that I would never say such an unfeeling, rude thing about actors at all. What I probably said, was that all actors should be treated like cattle...In a nice way of course.” He then described Carole Lombard's joke, with a smile.&lt;ref&gt;This [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuD1yloq5pY portion of the interview] is available on youtube. The entire episode is available on Criterion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: "I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said, 'That's not acting. That's writing.' “&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock |publisher=British Film Institute |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210051052/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html#actors |archive-date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalling their experiences on ''Lifeboat'' for Charles Chandler, author of ''It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography,'' [[Walter Slezak]] said that Hitchcock “knew more about how to help an actor than any director I ever worked with”, and [[Hume Cronyn]] dismissed the idea that Hitchcock was not concerned with his actors as “utterly fallacious”, describing at length the process of rehearsing and filming ''Lifeboat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography |publisher=Simon and Schuster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKRhkdxsFs8C&amp;pg=PT133 |isbn=978-1-84739-709-6 |date=9 December 2008 |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222214437/https://books.google.com/books?id=oKRhkdxsFs8C&amp;pg=PT133 |archive-date=22 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics observed that, despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances. He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant and James Stewart both worked with Hitchcock four times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as "animated props".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told François Truffaut: "The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing, storyboards and production===
Hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:

{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one |title=Hitchcock: "Never mess about with a dead body—you may be one&amp;nbsp;.... |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=14 December 1969|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212084523/https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|archive-date=12 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{cite book |last1=Pallant |first1=Chris |title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding |year=2015 |work=Storyboarding: A Critical History |pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris |series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6 |isbn=978-1-137-02760-3 |last2=Price |first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]
This view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.&lt;ref name= "krohn1–7"&gt;{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.&lt;ref name="Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217"&gt;{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.&lt;ref name="Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217"/&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]
Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they chose (often under the producer's aegis).&lt;ref name="Heritage02-28-07"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehman |first=David |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml |title=Alfred Hitchcock's America |work=American Heritage |date=April–May 2007|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml |archive-date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work.

According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each [[film poster]] for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Poster Master With a Cool Hand |first=Mekado |last=Murphy |date=3 December 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05posters.html|access-date=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223132525/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05posters.html|archive-date=23 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Bass]]—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.&lt;ref name="Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217"/&gt;
