'''Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio''' ({{IPAc-en|d|i|ˈ|k|æ|p|r|i|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|diˈkaːprjo|lang}}; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, film producer, and [[environmentalist]]. He has played unconventional roles, usually in biopics and period films. {{As of|2019}}, his films have grossed $7.2&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide, and he placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.

Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom ''[[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|Parenthood]]''. DiCaprio had his first major film role as [[Tobias Wolff|Tobias "Toby" Wolff]] in ''[[This Boy's Life]]'' (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy Arnie Grape in ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'' (1993), becoming the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 4|seventh-youngest]] nominee in the category. He achieved international stardom in the epic romance ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), which became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] to that point. After a few commercially unsuccessful films, DiCaprio starred in two successful features in 2002: the biographical crime drama ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' and the historical drama ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', which marked his first of [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|many collaborations]] with director [[Martin Scorsese]].

DiCaprio portrayed [[Howard Hughes]] in ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004) and continued to receive acclaim for his performances in the political thriller ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'' (2006), the crime drama ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006), and the romantic drama ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'' (2008). In the 2010s, he starred in the science fiction thriller ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), the western ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012), the biopic ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013), the survival drama ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015), and the comedy-drama ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]'' (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes. [[List of awards and nominations received by Leonardo DiCaprio|His accolades]] include an [[Academy Award]], a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]], and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for ''The Revenant'' as well as two other Golden Globes for ''The Aviator'' and ''The Wolf of Wall Street''.

DiCaprio is the founder of [[Appian Way Productions]]—a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series ''[[Greensburg (TV series)|Greensburg]]'' (2008–2010)—and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment. In 2005, he was named the commander of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he was named one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

In 1991, DiCaprio played an un-credited role in one episode of ''[[Roseanne]]''.{{sfn|Wight|2012|p=276}} He made his film debut later that year as the stepson of an evil landlord in the low-budget horror [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Critters 3]]'', a role he described as "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair."&lt;ref name="ny1" /&gt; DiCaprio prefers not to remember his role in ''Critters 3'', which he describes as "possibly one of the worst films of all time. I guess it was a good example to look back and make sure it doesn't happen again."{{sfn|Wight|2012|loc=360–361}} Later that year, he became a recurring cast member on the sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]'', playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family.{{sfn|Wight|2012|loc=331, 375}} Costar [[Joanna Kerns]] recalls DiCaprio being "especially intelligent and disarming for his age" but also mischievous on set.&lt;ref name="theindependent"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yahr |first1=Emily |title=How Leonardo DiCaprio went from being a dorky teenage actor to a superstar |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/leonardo-dicaprio-how-a-dorky-teenage-actor-became-a-superstar-a6891181.html |access-date=October 9, 2019 |work=The Independent |date=February 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009133108/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/leonardo-dicaprio-how-a-dorky-teenage-actor-became-a-superstar-a6891181.html |archive-date=October 9, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teenage DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to the teenage female audiences, but when the show's ratings did not improve, DiCaprio left it.{{sfn|Wight|2012|loc=331, 375}} He was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=13th Annual Awards |url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms13.htm |publisher=Young Artist Awards |access-date=October 9, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ww3QZoLx?url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms13.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, DiCaprio co-starred as the intellectually disabled brother of [[Johnny Depp]]'s character in ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'', a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional [[Iowa]] family.

Also in 2002, DiCaprio starred in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', a historical drama set in the mid-19th century in the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points district]] of New York City.

Early in his career, DiCaprio gained a reputation for his intense partying with his male friends.&lt;ref name="theindependent" /&gt; He said people's perception of him was exaggerated, adding, "They want you miserable, just like them.
