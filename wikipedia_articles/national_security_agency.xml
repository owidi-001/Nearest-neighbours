The '''National Security Agency''' ('''NSA''') is a national-level [[intelligence agency]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]], under the authority of the [[Director of National Intelligence]]. The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and [[counterintelligence]] purposes, specializing in a discipline known as [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT). The NSA is also tasked with the [[Information assurance|protection]] of U.S. communications networks and information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NSA: Mission |publisher=National Security Agency |url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml|access-date=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakashima" /&gt; The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are [[clandestine operations|clandestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Executive Order 13470]] – [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2008-08-04/pdf/WCPD-2008-08-04-Pg1064.pdf 2008 Amendments to Executive Order 12333], United States Intelligence Activities, July 30, 2008 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in [[World War II]], it was officially formed as the NSA by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1952. Since then, it has become the largest of the [[U.S. intelligence community#Organization|U.S. intelligence organizations]] in terms of personnel and budget.&lt;ref name="wapoblack1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford, James]]. ''[[Body of Secrets]]: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', [[Random House Digital, Inc.]], December 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA currently conducts [[mass surveillance|worldwide mass data collection]] and has been known to physically [[bugging|bug]] electronic systems as one method to this end.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Bonnie. "NSA surveillance: US bugged EU offices". ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', June 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as [[Stuxnet]], which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;Ngak, Chenda. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nsa-leaker-snowden-claimed-us-and-israel-co-wrote-stuxnet-virus/ "NSA leaker Snowden claimed U.S. and Israel co-wrote Stuxnet virus"], [[CBS]], July 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bamford|first=James|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/?p=58188|title=The Secret War |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125144725/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/?p=58188|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=June 12, 2013|archive-date=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA, alongside the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe; the CIA/NSA joint [[Special Collection Service]] (a highly classified intelligence team) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets (such as presidential palaces or embassies). SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass "close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering".&lt;ref name=today01&gt;{{cite episode |credits=[[Ann Curry]] (anchor), John Pike (guest), [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]] (guest) and [[James Bamford]] (guest) |title=Congress to Hold Closed Hearings on Accused Spy Robert Hanssen Later This Week |series=Today |series-link=Today (U.S. TV program) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=February 27, 2001 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/010227-spy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lichtblau01&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |author-link=Eric Lichtblau |title=Spy Suspect May Have Revealed U.S. Bugging; Espionage: Hanssen left signs that he told Russia where top-secret overseas eavesdropping devices are placed, officials say |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 28, 2001 |page=A1 | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/updates2/lat_spy010228.htm | archive-date=April 17, 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417230720/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/updates2/lat_spy010228.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the CIA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign [[Clandestine HUMINT|human espionage]], the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering. The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations – which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Executive Order 13470]] – [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2008-08-04/pdf/WCPD-2008-08-04-Pg1064.pdf 2008 Amendments to Executive Order 12333], United States Intelligence Activities'', Section C.2, July 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the [[Central Security Service]] (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense [[cryptanalysis]] components. To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] divisions, the [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA Director]] simultaneously serves as the Commander of the [[United States Cyber Command]] and as Chief of the Central Security Service.

The NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including [[#Vietnam War|its spying on anti–Vietnam War leaders]] and the agency's participation in [[economic espionage]]. In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|revealed to the public]] by [[Edward Snowden]], a former NSA contractor. According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens. The documents also revealed the NSA tracks hundreds of millions of people's movements using cellphones' [[metadata]]. Internationally, research has pointed to the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through "[[Network Sovereignty#Protection of National Traffic|boomerang routing]]".&lt;ref name="boomerang"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Obar |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Clement |first2=Andrew |title=Internet Surveillance and Boomerang Routing: A Call for Canadian Network Sovereignty |editor1-last=Ross |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Shtern |editor2-first=J. |conference=TEM 2013: Proceedings of the Technology &amp; Emerging Media Track – Annual Conference of the [[Canadian Communication Association]] |location=Victoria, British Columbia |orig-year=June 5–7, 2012 |date=July 1, 2013 |ssrn=2311792 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2311792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The origins of the National Security Agency can be traced back to April 28, 1917, three weeks after the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] declared war on Germany in [[World War I]]. A [[Code (cryptography)|code]] and [[cipher]] decryption unit was established as the Cable and Telegraph Section which was also known as the Cipher Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/center-cryptologic-history/pearl-harbor-review/black-chamber.shtml |title= The Black Chamber - Pearl Harbor Review |publisher= nsa.gov |access-date= 23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was headquartered in Washington, D.C. and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization. During the course of the war, it was relocated in the army's organizational chart several times. On July 5, 1917, [[Herbert O. Yardley]] was assigned to head the unit. At that point, the unit consisted of Yardley and two [[civilian]] clerks. It absorbed the Navy's [[cryptanalysis]] functions in July 1918. World War I ended on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November 11, 1918]], and the army cryptographic section of Military Intelligence (MI-8) moved to New York City on May 20, 1919, where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company under the direction of Yardley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/457.html|title=The National Archives, Records of the National Security Agency|access-date=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-spectrum/assets/files/many_lives.pdf |title=The Many Lives of Herbert O. Yardley|access-date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Black Chamber ===
{{main|Black Chamber}}
[[File:Black Chamber cryptanalytic work sheet for solving Japanese diplomatic cipher, 1919 - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07698.JPG|thumb|right|Black Chamber cryptanalytic work sheet for solving Japanese diplomatic cipher, 1919]]

After the disbandment of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] cryptographic section of military intelligence, known as MI-8, in 1919, the U.S. government created the Cipher Bureau, also known as [[Black Chamber]]. The Black Chamber was the United States' first peacetime [[cryptanalytic]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yardley|first=Herbert O.|title=The American black chamber|year=1931|publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]]|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=978-1-59114-989-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly funded by the Army and the State Department, the Cipher Bureau was disguised as a [[New York City]] [[commercial code (communications)|commercial code]] company; it actually produced and sold such codes for business use. Its true mission, however, was to break the communications (chiefly diplomatic) of other nations. Its most notable known success was at the [[Washington Naval Conference]], during which it aided American negotiators considerably by providing them with the decrypted traffic of many of the conference delegations, most notably the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;!-- partially copied from the article Black Chamber --&gt; The Black Chamber successfully persuaded [[Western Union]], the largest U.S. [[Telegraphy|telegram]] company at the time, as well as several other communications companies to illegally give the Black Chamber access to cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James Bamford|title=Building America's secret surveillance state|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/06/10/building-americas-secret-surveillance-state/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613121507/http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/06/10/building-americas-secret-surveillance-state/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 13, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, these companies publicly discontinued their collaboration.

Despite the Chamber's initial successes, it was shut down in 1929 by U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry L. Stimson]], who defended his decision by stating, "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail."&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hastedt|first1=Glenn P.|title=Spies, wiretaps, and secret operations: An encyclopedia of American espionage|year=2009|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-85109-807-1|page=32|author2=Guerrier, Steven W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II and its aftermath ===
During [[World War II]], the [[Signal Intelligence Service]] (SIS) was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the [[Axis powers]].&lt;ref name="armymil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army Security Agency Established, 15 September 1945 |url=https://www.army.mil/article/110544/ |author=USAICoE History Office |website=army.mil |publisher=[[United States Army]] |access-date=November 9, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716133448/https://www.army.mil/article/110544/ |archive-date=July 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, the SIS was reorganized as the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]] (ASA), and it was placed under the leadership of the Director of Military Intelligence.&lt;ref name="armymil" /&gt;

On May 20, 1949, all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA).&lt;ref name="armymil" /&gt; This organization was originally established within the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] under the command of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;{{cite web |title=The Origins of the National Security Agency 1940–1952 (U)|last=Burns |first=Thomas L. |publisher=[[National Security Agency]] |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB278/02.PDF |website=gwu.edu |access-date=November 28, 2020 |page=60 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129024035/https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB278/02.PDF |archive-date=November 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFSA was tasked to direct Department of Defense communications and electronic intelligence activities, except those of U.S. [[military intelligence]] units.&lt;ref name=Burns /&gt; However, the AFSA was unable to centralize [[COMINT|communications intelligence]] and failed to coordinate with civilian agencies that shared its interests such as the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;ref name=Burns /&gt; In December 1951, President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered a panel to investigate how AFSA had failed to achieve its goals. The results of the investigation led to improvements and its redesignation as the National Security Agency.&lt;ref name=NSApt2of3&gt;{{cite web |title=The Creation of NSA – Part 2 of 3: The Brownell Committee |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/The_Creation_of_NSA_Part_3.pdf |website=nsa.gov |publisher=[[National Security Agency]] |access-date=July 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015612/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/The_Creation_of_NSA_Part_3.pdf |archive-date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Security Council]] issued a memorandum of October 24, 1952, that revised [[National Security Council Intelligence Directives|National Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) 9]]. On the same day, Truman issued a second memorandum that called for the establishment of the NSA.&lt;ref name=Truman&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum|author=Truman, Harry S. |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/truman/truman_memo.pdf |website=nsa.gov |publisher=[[National Security Agency]] |date=October 24, 1952 |access-date=July 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821073605/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/truman/truman_memo.pdf |archive-date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual establishment of the NSA was done by a November 4 memo by [[Robert A. Lovett]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], changing the name of the AFSA to the NSA, and making the new agency responsible for all communications intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas L. |last=Burns |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_histories/origins_of_nsa.pdf |title=The Origins of the National Security Agency |year=1990 |publisher=National Security Agency |series=United States Cryptologic History |volume=1 |pages=107–08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322122158/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_histories/origins_of_nsa.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-22 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since President Truman's memo was a [[classified information|classified]] document,&lt;ref name=Truman /&gt; the existence of the NSA was not known to the public at that time. Due to its ultra-secrecy the U.S. intelligence community referred to the NSA as "No Such Agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-such-agency-spies-on-the-communications-of-the-world/2013/06/06/5bcd46a6-ceb9-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html|title='No Such Agency' spies on the communications of the world|last=Anne Gearan|date=June 7, 2013|access-date=November 9, 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===
{{Main|Project MINARET|NESTOR (encryption)}}
In the 1960s, the NSA played a key role in expanding U.S. commitment to the [[Vietnam War]] by providing evidence of a [[North Vietnam]]ese attack on the American destroyer {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}} during the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |title=Vietnam Study, Casting Doubts, Remains Secret |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/31/politics/31war.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 31, 2005 |quote=The National Security Agency has kept secret since 2001 a finding by an agency historian that during the Tonkin Gulf episode, which helped precipitate the Vietnam War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secret operation, code-named "[[Project MINARET|MINARET]]", was set up by the NSA to monitor the phone communications of Senators [[Frank Church]] and [[Howard Baker]], as well as key leaders of the [[civil rights movement]], including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and prominent U.S. journalists and athletes who criticized the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Minaret&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk "Declassified NSA Files Show Agency Spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK Operation Minaret Set Up in the 1960s to Monitor Anti-Vietnam Critics, Branded 'Disreputable If Not Outright Illegal' by NSA Itself"] ''The Guardian'', September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project turned out to be controversial, and an internal review by the NSA concluded that its Minaret program was "disreputable if not outright illegal".&lt;ref name=Minaret /&gt;

The NSA mounted a major effort to secure tactical communications among U.S. forces during the war with mixed success. The [[NESTOR (encryption)|NESTOR]] family of compatible [[secure voice]] systems it developed was widely deployed during the [[Vietnam War]], with about 30,000 NESTOR sets produced. However, a variety of technical and operational problems limited their use, allowing the North Vietnamese to exploit and intercept U.S. communications.&lt;ref name=boaklectures&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boak|first=David G.|title=A History of U.S. Communications Security; the David G.

=== From 1980s to 1990s ===
In 1986, the NSA intercepted the communications of the Libyan government during the immediate aftermath of the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|Berlin discotheque bombing]]. The [[White House]] asserted that the NSA interception had provided "irrefutable" evidence that Libya was behind the bombing, which U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] cited as a justification for the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seymour M.

In 1999, a multi-year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA's role in economic espionage in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Peggy Becker |date=October 1999 |title=Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/cache/offonce/home/publications/studies?page=12 |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page=12 |access-date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the NSA founded the [[NSA Hall of Honor]], a memorial at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]] in Fort Meade, Maryland.&lt;ref name=SunHall /&gt; The memorial is a, "tribute to the pioneers and heroes who have made significant and long-lasting contributions to American cryptology".&lt;ref name=SunHall /&gt; NSA employees must be retired for more than fifteen years to qualify for the memorial.&lt;ref name=SunHall&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=NSA honors 4 in the science of codes |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-06-13/news/0306130156_1_cryptology-hall-of-honor-pioneers|date=June 13, 2003|work=The Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA's infrastructure deteriorated in the 1990s as defense budget cuts resulted in maintenance deferrals. On January 24, 2000, NSA headquarters suffered a total network outage for three days caused by an overloaded network. Incoming traffic was successfully stored on agency servers, but it could not be directed and processed. The agency carried out emergency repairs at a cost of $3&amp;nbsp;million to get the system running again. (Some incoming traffic was also directed instead to Britain's [[GCHQ]] for the time being.) Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] called the outage a "wake-up call" for the need to invest in the agency's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency|author=James Bamford|page=454 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA454|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|date=2007|isbn=978-0-307-42505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the defensive arm of the NSA—the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD)—started working more openly; the first public technical talk by an NSA scientist at a major cryptography conference was J. Solinas' presentation on efficient [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|Elliptic Curve Cryptography]] algorithms at Crypto 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koblitz|first=Neal|title=Random Curves: Journeys of a Mathematician|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2008|page=312|isbn=9783540740773}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD's cooperative approach to academia and industry culminated in its support for a [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|transparent process]] for replacing the outdated [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES) by an [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES). Cybersecurity policy expert [[Susan Landau]] attributes the NSA's harmonious collaboration with industry and academia in the selection of the AES in 2000—and the Agency's support for the choice of a strong encryption algorithm designed by Europeans rather than by Americans—to [[Brian Snow]], who was the Technical Director of IAD and represented the NSA as cochairman of the Technical Working Group for the AES competition, and [[Michael J. Jacobs (NSA)|Michael Jacobs]], who headed IAD at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Landau|first=Susan|title=NSA and Dual EC_DRBG: Deja vu all over again?|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=37|issue=4|year=2015|pages=72–83|doi=10.1007/s00283-015-9543-z|s2cid=124392006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

=== War on Terror ===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], the NSA created new IT systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the Internet and cellphones. [[ThinThread]] contained advanced [[data mining]] capabilities. It also had a "privacy mechanism"; surveillance was stored encrypted; decryption required a warrant. The research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems. ThinThread was cancelled when Michael Hayden chose [[Trailblazer Project|Trailblazer]], which did not include ThinThread's privacy system.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|first=Siobhan |last=Gorman |title=NSA killed system that sifted phone data legally|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.nsa18may18,1,5386811.story|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]] (Chicago, IL)|date=May 17, 2006 |access-date=March 7, 2008|quote=The privacy protections offered by ThinThread were also abandoned in the post–September 11 push by the president for a faster response to terrorism.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193047/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.nsa18may18%2C1%2C5386811.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trailblazer Project]] ramped up in 2002 and was worked on by [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC), [[Boeing]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[Litton Industries]]. Some NSA [[whistleblower]]s complained internally about major problems surrounding Trailblazer. This led to investigations by Congress and the NSA and DoD [[Inspectors General]]. The project was cancelled in early 2004.

[[Turbulence (NSA)|Turbulence]] started in 2005. It was developed in small, inexpensive "test" pieces, rather than one grand plan like Trailblazer. It also included offensive cyber-warfare capabilities, like injecting [[malware]] into remote computers. Congress criticized Turbulence in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as Trailblazer.&lt;ref name=Bamford325&gt;Bamford, [[Shadow Factory]], pp. 325–340.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be a realization of information processing at higher speeds in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bal-nsa050607,0,1517618.story|title=Management shortcomings seen at NSA |author=Baltimore Sun|date=May 6, 2007|work=baltimoresun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global surveillance disclosures ===
{{Main|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|l2=|selfref=}}

The massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic, was revealed to the public in a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents beginning in June 2013. Most of the disclosures were leaked by former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]]. On 4 September 2020, the NSA's surveillance program was ruled unlawful by the [[United States courts of appeals|US Court of Appeals]]. The court also added that the US intelligence leaders, who publicly defended it, were not telling the truth.&lt;ref name="unlawful2020"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54013527|title=NSA surveillance exposed by Snowden ruled unlawful|access-date=4 September 2020|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
{{Global surveillance}}
NSA's [[eavesdropping]] mission includes radio broadcasting, both from various organizations and individuals, the Internet, telephone calls, and other intercepted forms of communication. Its secure communications mission includes military, diplomatic, and all other sensitive, confidential or secret government communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bamford, James|title=The Agency That Could Be Big Brother|date=December 25, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25bamford.html|work=The New York Times |access-date=September 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "[e]very day, collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion e-mails, phone calls and other types of communications. The NSA sorts a fraction of those into 70 separate databases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dana Priest, William Arkin|author-link=Dana Priest|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/print/|title=A hidden world, growing beyond control]|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 19, 2010|access-date=April 12, 2015|archive-date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GaKmbwLd?url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/print/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its listening task, NSA/CSS has been heavily involved in [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] research, continuing the work of predecessor agencies which had broken many World War II [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s (see, for instance, [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]], [[Venona project]], and [[JN-25]]).

In 2004, NSA [[Central Security Service]] and the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) agreed to expand the NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=National Security Agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Form New Partnership to Increase National Focus on Cyber Security Education|url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2004/nsa_dhs_new_partnership.shtml|publisher=NSA Public and Media Affairs|access-date=July 4, 2008|date=April 22, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117020321/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2004/nsa_dhs_new_partnership.shtml|archive-date=2009-01-17|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[National Security Directive|National Security Presidential Directive]] 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD 54), signed on January 8, 2008, by President Bush, the NSA became the lead agency to monitor and protect all of the federal government's computer networks from [[cyber-terrorism]].&lt;ref name=Nakashima&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/25/AR2008012503261_pf.html|title=Bush Order Expands Network Monitoring: Intelligence Agencies to Track Intrusions|author=Ellen Nakashima|work=The Washington Post|date=January 26, 2008|access-date=February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
Operations by the National Security Agency can be divided into three types:
* Collection overseas, which falls under the responsibility of the Global Access Operations (GAO) division.
* Domestic collection, which falls under the responsibility of the [[Special Source Operations]] (SSO) division.
* Hacking operations, which fall under the responsibility of the [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) division.

==== Boundless Informant ====
[[Edward Snowden]] revealed in June 2013 that between February 8 and March 8, 2013, the NSA collected about 124.8&amp;nbsp;billion telephone data items and 97.1&amp;nbsp;billion computer data items throughout the world, as was displayed in charts from an internal NSA tool codenamed [[Boundless Informant]]. Initially, it was reported that some of these data reflected eavesdropping on citizens in countries like Germany, Spain and France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/10/21/france-in-the-nsa-s-crosshair-phone-networks-under-surveillance_3499741_651865.html France in the NSA's crosshair : phone networks under surveillance] Le Monde October 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but later on, it became clear that those data were collected by European agencies during military missions abroad and were subsequently shared with NSA.

==== Bypassing encryption ====
In 2013, reporters uncovered a secret memo that claims the NSA created and pushed for the adoption of the [[Dual EC DRBG]] encryption standard that contained built-in vulnerabilities in 2006 to the United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (aka ISO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicole |last=Perlroth |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announces-steps-to-restore-confidence-on-encryption-standards/ |title=Government Announces Steps to Restore Confidence on Encryption Standards |website=The New York Times |type=Bits blog |date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pp20130905 /&gt; This memo appears to give credence to previous speculation by cryptographers at [[Microsoft Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html |title=Schneier on Security: The Strange Story of Dual_EC_DRBG |publisher=Schneier.com |date=November 15, 2007 |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Snowden]] claims that the NSA often bypasses encryption altogether by lifting information before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted.&lt;ref name=pp20130905&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption|title=The NSA's Secret Campaign to Crack, Undermine Internet Security|date=September 5, 2013|publisher=[[ProPublica]]|author=Perlroth, Nicole, Larson, Jeff, and Shane, Scott|quote=This story has been reported in partnership between The New York Times, the Guardian and ProPublica based on documents obtained by The Guardian.

==== Software backdoors ====
[[Linus Torvalds]], the founder of [[Linux kernel]], joked during a [[LinuxCon]] keynote on September 18, 2013, that the NSA, who are the founder of [[SELinux]], wanted a backdoor in the kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/news/2013/09/techweekeurope-linus-torvalds-jokes-nsa-wanted-backdoor-linux|title=TechWeekEurope: Linus Torvalds Jokes The NSA Wanted A Backdoor In Linux |work=linuxfoundation.org|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916142701/http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/news/2013/09/techweekeurope-linus-torvalds-jokes-nsa-wanted-backdoor-linux|archive-date=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later, Linus' father, a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), revealed that the NSA actually did this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://falkvinge.net/2013/11/17/nsa-asked-linus-torvalds-to-install-backdoors-into-gnulinux/|title=NSA Asked Linus Torvalds To Install Backdoors Into GNU/Linux|work=falkvinge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When my oldest son was asked the same question: "Has he been approached by the NSA about backdoors?" he said "No", but at the same time he nodded. Then he was sort of in the legal free.

[[IBM Notes]] was the first widely adopted software product to use [[public key cryptography]] for client–server and server–server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric encryption]] keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the NSA that allowed the export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a "workload reduction factor" for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector [[industrial espionage]], but not against spying by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States|"The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow!"]] [[intelligence agency|The Risks Digest]], Volume 19, Issue 52, December 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[codebreaking|Only NSA can listen, so that's OK]] Heise, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Boomerang routing ====
While it is assumed that foreign transmissions terminating in the U.S. (such as a non-U.S. citizen accessing a U.S. website) subject non-U.S. citizens to NSA surveillance, recent research into boomerang routing has raised new concerns about the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries.&lt;ref name="boomerang" /&gt; Boomerang routing occurs when an Internet transmission that originates and terminates in a single country transits another. Research at the [[University of Toronto]] has suggested that approximately 25% of Canadian domestic traffic may be subject to NSA surveillance activities as a result of the boomerang routing of Canadian [[Internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref name="boomerang" /&gt;

==== Hardware implanting ====
{{Multiple image|image1 = NSA implanting station.jpg|image2 = NSA interception.jpg|caption1 = Intercepted packages are opened carefully by NSA employees|caption2 = A "load station" implanting a beacon}}

A document included in NSA files released with [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s book ''[[No Place to Hide (Greenwald book)|No Place to Hide]]'' details how the agency's [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) and other NSA units gain access to hardware. They intercept [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Server (computing)|servers]] and other [[network hardware]] being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert implant firmware onto them before they are delivered. This was described by an NSA manager as "some of the most productive operations in TAO because they preposition access points into hard target networks around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant|title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant|last = Gallagher|first=Sean|date=May 14, 2014|website=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers seized by the NSA due to [[interdiction]] are often modified with a physical device known as Cottonmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitwam|first=Ryan|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/173721-the-nsa-regularly-intercepts-laptop-shipments-to-implant-malware-report-says/ |title=The NSA regularly intercepts laptop shipments to implant malware report says|work=extremetech.com |date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cottonmouth is a device that can be inserted in the USB port of a computer in order to establish remote access to the targeted machine. According to NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group implant catalog, after implanting Cottonmouth, the NSA can establish a [[Bridging (networking)|network bridge]] "that allows the NSA to load exploit software onto modified computers as well as allowing the NSA to relay commands and data between hardware and software implants."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/static/happ/netzwelt/2014/na/v1/pub/img/USB/S3223_COTTONMOUTH-I.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic collection ===
{{Further|Mass surveillance in the United States}}
NSA's mission, as set forth in [[Executive Order 12333]] in 1981, is to collect information that constitutes "foreign intelligence or counterintelligence" while ''not'' "acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of [[United States person]]s". NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the United States, while confining its own activities within the United States to the embassies and missions of foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf nsa.gov: The NSA story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209113543/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf |date=2014-12-09 }}, retrieved January 19, 2015 – Page 3: 'NSA ... will work with the FBI and other agencies to connect the dots between foreign-based actors and their activities in the U.S.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of a 'Domestic Surveillance Directorate' of the NSA was soon exposed as a hoax in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nsa.gov1.info/ Domestic Surveillance Directorate website], retrieved January 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/08/29/the-definitive-nsa-parody-site-is-actually-informative/ forbes.com: The Definitive NSA Parody Site Is Actually Informative], retrieved January 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA's domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. The [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] for example held in October 2011, citing multiple Supreme Court precedents, that the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures apply to the contents of all communications, whatever the means, because "a person's private communications are akin to personal papers."&lt;ref name="FiscPrivacyRuling2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/fisc_opinion_-_unconstitutional_surveillance_0.pdf|pages=73–74|date=October 3, 2011|author=John D Bates|title=[redacted]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these protections do not apply to non-U.S. persons located outside of U.S. borders, so the NSA's foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under U.S. law.&lt;ref name="Jordan_David"&gt;David Alan Jordan.

Boston College Law Review. May 2006. Last access date January 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The specific requirements for domestic surveillance operations are contained in the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 (FISA), which does not extend protection to non-U.S. citizens located outside of [[U.S. territory]].&lt;ref name="Jordan_David" /&gt;

==== President's Surveillance Program ====
[[George W. Bush]], president during the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]], approved the [[Patriot Act]] shortly after the attacks to take anti-terrorist security measures. [[Patriot Act, Title I|Title 1]], [[Patriot Act, Title II|2]], and [[Patriot Act, Title IX|9]] specifically authorized measures that would be taken by the NSA. These titles granted enhanced domestic security against terrorism, surveillance procedures, and improved intelligence, respectively. On March 10, 2004, there was a debate between President Bush and White House Counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]], Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], and Acting Attorney General [[James Comey]]. The Attorneys General were unsure if the NSA's programs could be considered constitutional. They threatened to resign over the matter, but ultimately the NSA's programs continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=President George W. Bush's Influence Over Bureaucracy and Policy|last=Provost|first=Colin|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-60954-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/presidentgeorgew0000unse/page/94 94–99]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidentgeorgew0000unse/page/94}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2004, President Bush signed a new authorization for mass surveillance of Internet records, in addition to the surveillance of phone records. This allowed the president to be able to override laws such as the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], which protected civilians from mass surveillance. In addition to this, President Bush also signed that the measures of mass surveillance were also retroactively in place.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-09-20 /&gt;

=== Hacking operations ===
Besides the more traditional ways of eavesdropping in order to collect signals intelligence, NSA is also engaged in [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] computers, smartphones and their networks. These operations are conducted by the [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) division, which has been active since at least circa 1998.&lt;ref name=fp2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aid|first=Matthew M.|title=Inside the NSA's Ultra-Secret China Hacking Group|journal=Foreign Policy|date=10 June 2013|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/10/inside-the-nsas-ultra-secret-china-hacking-group/|access-date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, "... the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO, has successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.businessinsider.com/us-nsa-unit-tao-hacking-china-for-years-2013-6 U.S. NSA Unit 'TAO' Hacking China For Years]".

== Organizational structure ==
[[File:General Paul M. Nakasone (NSA).jpg|thumb|[[Paul M. Nakasone]], the director of the NSA.]]

The NSA is led by the [[Director of the National Security Agency]] (DIRNSA), who also serves as Chief of the [[Central Security Service]] (CHCSS) and Commander of the [[United States Cyber Command]] (USCYBERCOM) and is the highest-ranking military official of these organizations. He is assisted by a [[Deputy Director of the National Security Agency|Deputy Director]], who is the highest-ranking civilian within the NSA/CSS.

NSA also has an [[Inspector General]], head of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a [[General Counsel]], head of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and a Director of Compliance, who is head of the Office of the Director of Compliance (ODOC).&lt;ref&gt;These offices are for example mentioned in a [http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/PrimaryOrder_Collection_215.pdf FISA court order] from 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other intelligence organizations such as the CIA or [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]], NSA has always been particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure.

As of the mid-1990s, the National Security Agency was organized into five Directorates:
* The Operations Directorate, which was responsible for SIGINT collection and processing.
* The Technology and Systems Directorate, which develops new technologies for SIGINT collection and processing.
* The Information Systems Security Directorate, which was responsible for NSA's communications and information security missions.
* The Plans, Policy and Programs Directorate, which provided staff support and general direction for the Agency.
* The Support Services Directorate, which provided logistical and administrative support activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html |title=National Security Agency |publisher=fas.org |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each of these directorates consisted of several groups or elements, designated by a letter. There were for example the A Group, which was responsible for all SIGINT operations against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and G Group, which was responsible for SIGINT related to all non-communist countries. These groups were divided into units designated by an additional number, like unit A5 for breaking Soviet codes, and G6, being the office for the Middle East, North Africa, Cuba, Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Aid, The Secret Sentry, New York, 2009, pp. 130, 138, 156–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the information about the historical structure of NSA that is archived at [https://fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html#organizations FAS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, NSA has about a dozen directorates, which are designated by a letter, although not all of them are publicly known.&lt;ref&gt;TheWeek.com: [http://theweek.com/article/index/249658/the-nsas-secret-org-chart The NSA's secret org chart], September 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, a leadership team was formed, consisting of the Director, the Deputy Director and the Directors of the Signals Intelligence (SID), the Information Assurance (IAD) and the Technical Directorate (TD). The chiefs of other main NSA divisions became associate directors of the senior leadership team.&lt;ref name=nsa60&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf National Security Agency – 60 Years of Defending Our Nation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623141614/https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf |date=2018-06-23 }}, Anniversary booklet, 2012, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

After president George W. Bush initiated the [[President's Surveillance Program]] (PSP) in 2001, the NSA created a 24-hour Metadata Analysis Center (MAC), followed in 2004 by the Advanced Analysis Division (AAD), with the mission of analyzing content, Internet metadata and telephone metadata. Both units were part of the Signals Intelligence Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ambinder, [http://theweek.com/article/index/246277/3008-selectors 3008 Selectors], June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSANet is a highly secured computer network consisting of fiber-optic and satellite communication channels which are almost completely separated from the public Internet. The network allows NSA personnel and civilian and military intelligence analysts anywhere in the world to have access to the agency's systems and databases. This access is tightly controlled and monitored. For example, every keystroke is logged, activities are audited at random and downloading and printing of documents from NSANet are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ambinder, [http://theweek.com/article/index/245408/how-a-single-it-tech-could-spy-on-the-world How a single IT tech could spy on the world], June 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, NSANet, along with [[NIPRNET]] and [[SIPRNET]], had "significant problems with poor search capabilities, unorganized data and old information".&lt;ref name=nps2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/1998/Sep/98Sep_Misiewicz.pdf |title=Thesis; Modeling and Simulation of a Global Reachback Architecture ... |date=September 1998 |access-date=April 13, 2011 |author=Misiewicz |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812153842/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/1998/Sep/98Sep_Misiewicz.pdf |archive-date=August 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the network was reported to have used over twenty [[commercial off-the-shelf]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=cmu1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/jarzombek.pdf|title=Systems, Network, and Information Integration Context for Software Assurance|author=Joe Jarzombek|year=2004|access-date=April 13, 2011|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities that do highly sensitive research are allowed to connect to it.&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exportcontrols.msu.edu/FBI_2010/Dr_Christopher_Griffin_Applied_Research_Laboratories_Penn_State_University_10_20_2010.pdf|title=Dealing with Sensitive Data at Penn State's Applied Research Laboratory: Approach and Examples|author= Christopher Griffin|year=2010|access-date=April 13, 2011|publisher=msu.edu}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thousands of Top Secret internal NSA documents that were taken by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013 were stored in "a file-sharing location on the NSA's intranet site"; so, they could easily be read online by NSA personnel. Everyone with a TS/SCI-clearance had access to these documents. As a system administrator, Snowden was responsible for moving accidentally misplaced highly sensitive documents to safer storage locations.&lt;ref&gt;NPR.org: [https://www.npr.org/2013/09/18/223523622/officials-edward-snowdens-leaks-were-masked-by-job-duties Officials: Edward Snowden's Leaks Were Masked By Job Duties], September 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watch centers ===
The NSA maintains at least two watch centers:

* [[National Security Operations Center]] (NSOC), which is the NSA's current operations center and focal point for time-sensitive SIGINT reporting for the United States SIGINT System (USSS). This center was established in 1968 as the National SIGINT Watch Center (NSWC) and renamed into National SIGINT Operations Center (NSOC) in 1973. This "nerve center of the NSA" got its current name in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2012/12/pictures-at-nsas-60th-anniversary.html Pictures at the NSA's 60th anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt;
* NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC), which is the primary NSA/CSS partner for [[Department of Homeland Security]] response to cyber incidents. The NTOC establishes real-time network awareness and threat characterization capabilities to forecast, alert, and attribute malicious activity and enable the coordination of Computer Network Operations. The NTOC was established in 2004 as a joint Information Assurance and Signals Intelligence project.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf National Security Agency – 60 Years of Defending Our Nation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623141614/https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf |date=2018-06-23 }}, Anniversary booklet, 2012, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSA Police===
The NSA has its own police force, known as ''NSA Police'' (and formerly as ''NSA Security Protective Force'') which provides law enforcement services, emergency response and physical security to the NSA's people and property.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2604199/making-a-difference-over-30-years-with-the-nsa-police/&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA Police are armed federal officers. NSA Police have use of a K9 division, which generally conducts explosive detection screening of mail, vehicles and cargo entering NSA grounds. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/1581793/nsa-police-k-9-unit-celebrates-140-dog-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA Police use marked vehicles to carry out patrols.&lt;ref&gt;https://washington.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909891/2015/06/gettyimages-76864184-e1435148637500.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;crop=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employees ==
The number of NSA employees is officially classified&lt;ref name=Introv&gt;"[http://fcw.com/blogs/circuit/2012/04/fedsmc-chris-inglis-federal-workforce.aspx Introverted? Then NSA wants you.]" ''[[Florida Championship Wrestling]]''. April 2012. Retrieved July 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but there are several sources providing estimates.
In 1961, NSA had 59,000 military and civilian employees, which grew to 93,067 in 1969, of which 19,300 worked at the headquarters at Fort Meade. In the early 1980s, NSA had roughly 50,000 military and civilian personnel. By 1989 this number had grown again to 75,000, of which 25,000 worked at the NSA headquarters. Between 1990 and 1995 the NSA's budget and workforce were cut by one third, which led to a substantial loss of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Aid, The Secret Sentry, New York, 2009, pp. 128, 148, 190 and 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the NSA said more than 30,000 employees worked at Fort Meade and other facilities.&lt;ref name=60yearsp3 /&gt; In 2012, [[John C. Inglis]], the deputy director, said that the total number of NSA employees is "somewhere between 37,000 and one billion" as a joke,&lt;ref name=Introv /&gt; and stated that the agency is "probably the biggest employer of [[Extraversion and introversion|introverts]]."&lt;ref name=Introv /&gt; In 2013 ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' stated that the NSA had 40,000 employees.&lt;ref name="employees"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/prism-leak-inside-the-controversial-us-data-surveillance-program-a-904761.html |title=Prism Exposed: Data Surveillance with Global Implications |page=2 |publisher=Spiegel Online International |date=June 10, 2013|newspaper=Spiegel Online |last1=Rosenbach |first1=Marcel |last2=Stark |first2=Holger |last3=Stock |first3=Jonathan }} "How can an intelligence agency, even one as large and well-staffed as the NSA with its 40,000 employees, work meaningfully with such a flood of information?"&lt;/ref&gt; More widely, it has been described as the world's largest single employer of [[mathematician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=Statement for the Record |author=Harvey A.

As of 2013 about 1,000 [[system administrator]]s work for the NSA.&lt;ref name=DrewSengupta /&gt;

=== Personnel security ===
The NSA received criticism early on in 1960 after two agents had defected to the [[Soviet Union]]. Investigations by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and a special subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]] revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations, prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;David Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', Scribner Press, 1967, chapter 19, pp. 672–733.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of ''[[Izvestia]]'' of July 23, 1963, a former NSA employee published several cryptologic secrets.

The very same day, an NSA clerk-messenger committed [[suicide]] as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the Soviets on a regular basis. The reluctance of Congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write, "If a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of Government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured, demoted, or fired." [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] criticized the NSA's tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the Congress' blind faith in the agency's right-doing as shortsighted, and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the Congress to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt;

[[Edward Snowden]]'s leaking of the existence of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] in 2013 caused the NSA to institute a "[[two-man rule]]", where two system administrators are required to be present when one accesses certain sensitive information.&lt;ref name=DrewSengupta&gt;{{cite news|author1=Drew, Christopher  |author2=Somini Sengupta |name-list-style=amp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/technology/nsa-leak-puts-focus-on-system-administrators.html|title=N.S.A.

==== Polygraphing ====
[[File:DOD polygraph brochure.pdf|thumb|[[Defense Security Service]] (DSS) polygraph brochure given to NSA applicants]]
The NSA conducts [[polygraph]] tests of employees. For new employees, the tests are meant to discover enemy spies who are applying to the NSA and to uncover any information that could make an applicant pliant to coercion.&lt;ref name=Bauer359&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBkEGAOlCDsC&amp;pg=PA359|author=Bauer, Craig P.|title=Secret History: The Story of Cryptology |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6186-1|year=2013|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the latter, historically ''EPQs'' or "embarrassing personal questions" about sexual behavior had been included in the NSA polygraph.&lt;ref name=Bauer359 /&gt; The NSA also conducts five-year periodic reinvestigation polygraphs of employees, focusing on counterintelligence programs. In addition the NSA conducts periodic polygraph investigations in order to find spies and leakers; those who refuse to take them may receive "termination of employment", according to a 1982 memorandum from the director of the NSA.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyp538&gt;{{cite book|author=Bamford|title=Body of Secrets|chapter=page 538 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA538 |author-link=James Bamford|title-link=Body of Secrets|date=18 December 2007|isbn=9780307425058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NSApolygraphvideo.webm|thumb|left|180px|NSA-produced video on the polygraph process]]
There are also "special access examination" polygraphs for employees who wish to work in highly sensitive areas, and those polygraphs cover counterintelligence questions and some questions about behavior.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyp538 /&gt; NSA's brochure states that the average test length is between two and four hours.&lt;ref name=NSApolybrochure&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Polygraph Examination: An Important Appointment to Keep|url=https://www.nsa.gov/careers/_files/poly_brochure_final2.pdf|publisher=National Security Agency|access-date=June 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903162514/http://www.nsa.gov/careers/_files/poly_brochure_final2.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1983 report of the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] stated that "It appears that the NSA [National Security Agency] (and possibly CIA) use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se, but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McCarthy, Susan|title=The truth about the polygraph|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/03/02/polygraph/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes applicants in the polygraph process confess to committing felonies such as murder, rape, and selling of illegal drugs. Between 1974 and 1979, of the 20,511 job applicants who took polygraph tests, 695 (3.4%) confessed to previous felony crimes; almost all of those crimes had been undetected.&lt;ref name=Bauer359 /&gt;

In 2010 the NSA produced a video explaining its polygraph process.&lt;ref name=Nageshvideo&gt;{{cite news|author=Nagesh, Gautham|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/102963-nsa-video-comes-clean-on-polygraph-use|title=NSA video tries to dispel fear about polygraph use during job interviews|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=June 14, 2010|access-date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video, ten minutes long, is titled "The Truth About the Polygraph" and was posted to the Web site of the [[Defense Security Service]]. Jeff Stein of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that the video portrays "various applicants, or actors playing them—it's not clear—describing everything bad they had heard about the test, the implication being that none of it is true."&lt;ref name=Steinpolygraph&gt;Stein, Jeff.

Retrieved July 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; AntiPolygraph.org argues that the NSA-produced video omits some information about the polygraph process; it produced a video responding to the NSA video.&lt;ref name="Nageshvideo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Maschke|first=George|date=13 June 2010|title=The Truth About the Polygraph (According to the NSA)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93_FDeMENN4|access-date=15 July 2020|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Maschke, the founder of the Web site, accused the NSA polygraph video of being "[[Orwellian]]".&lt;ref name=Steinpolygraph /&gt;

After [[Edward Snowden]] revealed his identity in 2013, the NSA began requiring polygraphing of employees once per quarter.&lt;ref name=Drezner&gt;Drezner, Daniel. "[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/12/16/tone_deaf_at_the_listening_post_my_day_at_the_NSA Tone-Deaf at the Listening Post]." ''[[Foreign Policy]]''. December 16, 2013. Retrieved March 1, 2014. "Snowden has also changed the way the NSA is doing business. Analysts have gone from being polygraphed once every five years to once every quarter."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arbitrary firing ===
The number of exemptions from legal requirements has been criticized. When in 1964 Congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the NSA the power to fire at will any employee, ''The Washington Post'' wrote: "This is the very definition of arbitrariness. It means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself." Yet, the bill was accepted by an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt; Also, every person hired to a job in the US after 2007, at any private organization, state or federal government agency, ''must'' be reported to the [[New Hire Registry]], ostensibly to look for [[child support]] evaders, ''except'' that employees of an intelligence agency may be excluded from reporting if the director deems it necessary for national security reasons.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

[[File:NSA-Fort Meade-1950.png|thumb|Headquarters at [[Fort Meade]] circa 1950s]]
When the agency was first established, its headquarters and cryptographic center were in the Naval Security Station in Washington, D.C.  The COMINT functions were located in [[Arlington Hall]] in [[Northern Virginia]], which served as the headquarters of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s cryptographic operations.&lt;ref name=60yearsp15&gt;{{cite web|title=60 Years of Defending Our Nation|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2012|url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|access-date=July 6, 2013|page=15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614022314/http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-14|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Soviet Union]] had detonated a nuclear bomb and because the facilities were crowded, the federal government wanted to move several agencies, including the AFSA/NSA. A planning committee considered [[Fort Knox]], but [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]], was ultimately chosen as NSA headquarters because it was far enough away from Washington, D.C. in case of a nuclear strike and was close enough so its employees would not have to move their families.&lt;ref name="60yearsp10" /&gt;

Construction of additional buildings began after the agency occupied buildings at Fort Meade in the late 1950s, which they soon outgrew.&lt;ref name=60yearsp10&gt;{{cite web|title=60 Years of Defending Our Nation|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2012|url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|access-date=July 6, 2013|page=10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614022314/http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/60th/book/NSA_60th_Anniversary.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-14|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 the new headquarters building, nine stories tall, opened.

The main NSA headquarters and operations building is what [[James Bamford]], author of ''[[Body of Secrets]]'', describes as "a modern boxy structure" that appears similar to "any stylish office building."&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp488&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford]], ''[[Body of Secrets]]: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA488 p. 488]. "At the heart of the invisible city is NSA's massive Headquarters/Operations Building. With more than sixty-eight acres of floor space,[...]" and "Entrance is first made through the two-story Visitor Control Center, one[...]"&lt;/ref&gt; The building is covered with one-way dark glass, which is lined with copper shielding in order to prevent espionage by trapping in signals and sounds.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp488 /&gt; It contains {{convert|3000000|sqft|sqm}}, or more than {{convert|68|acre|ha}}, of floor space; Bamford said that the [[U.S. Capitol]] "could easily fit inside it four times over."&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp488 /&gt;

The facility has over 100 watchposts,&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp488489&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford]], ''Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VqY4Wr3T5K4C&amp;pg=PA488 488]–489. "[...]one of more than 100 fixed watch posts within the secret city manned by the armed NSA police. It is here that clearances are checked and visitor badges are issued."&lt;/ref&gt; one of them being the visitor control center, a two-story area that serves as the entrance.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp488 /&gt; At the entrance, a white pentagonal structure,&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp490&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford]], ''Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', p. 490. "And then there is the red badge—[...]and is normally worn by people working in the "Red Corridor"—the drugstore and other concession areas[...]Those with a red badge are forbidden to go anywhere near classified information and are restricted to a few corridors and administrative areas—the bank, the barbershop, the cafeteria, the credit union, the airline and entertainment ticket counters." and "Once inside the white, pentagonal Visitor Control Center, employees are greeted by a six-foot painting of the NSA seal[...]"&lt;/ref&gt; visitor badges are issued to visitors and security clearances of employees are checked.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp489&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford]], ''Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', p. 489. "It is here that clearances are checked and visitor badges are issued."&lt;/ref&gt; The visitor center includes a painting of the NSA seal.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp490 /&gt;

The OPS2A building, the tallest building in the NSA complex and the location of much of the agency's operations directorate, is accessible from the visitor center. Bamford described it as a "dark glass [[Rubik's Cube]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bamford|Bamford]], ''Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', p. 491. "From the Visitor Control Center one enters the eleven-story, million OPS2A, the tallest building in the City. Shaped like a dark glass Rubik's Cube, the building houses much of NSA's Operations Directorate, which is responsible for processing the ocean of intercepts and prying open the complex cipher systems."&lt;/ref&gt; The facility's "red corridor" houses non-security operations such as concessions and the drug store. The name refers to the "red badge" which is worn by someone without a security clearance. The NSA headquarters includes a cafeteria, a credit union, ticket counters for airlines and entertainment, a barbershop, and a bank.&lt;ref name=BamfordBodyofSecretsp490 /&gt; NSA headquarters has its own post office, fire department, and police force.&lt;ref name=Bamford-Alexander /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/careers/career_fields/others.shtml |title=Career Fields/Other Opportunities/NSA Police Officers section of the NSA website |publisher=Nsa.gov |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=T.C.

==== Power consumption ====
[[File:NeverSleeps 071310.jpg|thumb|Due to massive amounts of [[data processing]], NSA is the largest electricity consumer in Maryland.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt;]]

Following a major power outage in 2000, in 2003, and in follow-ups through 2007, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that the NSA was at risk of electrical overload because of insufficient internal electrical infrastructure at Fort Meade to support the amount of equipment being installed. This problem was apparently recognized in the 1990s but not made a priority, and "now the agency's ability to keep its operations going is threatened."&lt;ref name=Gorman-2006&gt;{{cite news|author=Sabar, Ariel|title=NSA still subject to electronic failure|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-01-02/news/0301020300_1_outages-electrical-and-computer-agency |date=January 2, 2003}} and "Agency officials anticipated the problem nearly a decade ago as they looked ahead at the technology needs of the agency, sources said, but it was never made a priority, and now the agency's ability to keep its operations going is threatened." and "The NSA is Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric's largest customer, using as much electricity as the city of Annapolis, according to James Bamford...." in {{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-08-06/news/0608060158_1_agency-power-surges-nsa|date=August 6, 2006|author=Gorman, Siobhan|title=NSA risking electrical overload}} and {{cite news|author=Gorman, Siobhan |title=NSA electricity crisis gets Senate scrutiny|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-01-26/news/0701260231_1_electricity-rockefeller-senate-intelligence-committee|date=January 26, 2007}} and {{cite news|author=Gorman, Siobhan|title=Power supply still a vexation for the NSA|date=June 24, 2007|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-06-24/news/0706240110_1_national-security-agency-classified-electricity|work=The Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2006, ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that the NSA had completely maxed out the grid, and that Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric (BGE, now [[Constellation Energy]]) was unable to sell them any more power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2006-08-06-0608060158-story.html|title=NSA risking electrical overload|first=SIOBHAN|last=GORMAN|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2018-12-23|archive-date=2020-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813231456/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2006-08-06-0608060158-story.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSA decided to move some of its operations to a new satellite facility.

BGE provided NSA with 65 to 75 [[Kilowatt-hour#Watt hour multiples and billing units|megawatts]] at Fort Meade in 2007, and expected that an increase of 10 to 15 megawatts would be needed later that year.&lt;ref&gt;"The NSA uses about 65 to 75 megawatt-hours of electricity, The Sun reported last week.

==== Computing assets ====
In 1995, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that the NSA is the owner of the single largest group of [[supercomputer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-12-10/news/1995344001_1_crypto-ag-nsa-headquarters-swiss |title=No Such Agency Part Four – Rigging the Game |author=[[Scott Shane]] and [[Tom Bowman (journalist)|Tom Bowman]] |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=December 10, 1995 |access-date=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA operates [[RAF Menwith Hill]] in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom, which was, according to [[BBC News]] in 2007, the largest electronic monitoring station in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6916262.stm |work=BBC News |title=UK agrees missile defence request|date=July 25, 2007|access-date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planned in 1954, and opened in 1960, the base covered {{convert|562|acre|ha sqmi}} in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Campbell, Duncan|date=December 6, 1999 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/136356|title=1980 – America's big ear on Europe|work=New Statesman|access-date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency's [[Dagger Complex|European Cryptologic Center]] (ECC), with 240 employees in 2011, is headquartered at a US military compound in [[Griesheim (Hesse)|Griesheim]], near [[Frankfurt]] in Germany. A 2011 NSA report indicates that the ECC is responsible for the "largest analysis and productivity in Europe" and focuses on various priorities, including Africa, Europe, the Middle East and counterterrorism operations.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach and Holger Stark, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-is-a-both-a-partner-to-and-a-target-of-nsa-surveillance-a-916029.html Ally and Target: US Intelligence Watches Germany Closely], August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a new Consolidated Intelligence Center, also to be used by NSA, is being built at the headquarters of the [[United States Army Europe]] in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Spiegel-RT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/edward-snowden-accuses-germany-of-aiding-nsa-in-spying-efforts-a-909847.html|publisher=Spiegel International|title= Snowden Interview: NSA and the Germans 'In Bed Together'|date=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSA's partnership with [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND), the German foreign intelligence service, was confirmed by BND president [[Gerhard Schindler]].&lt;ref name=Spiegel-RT /&gt;

==== Thailand ====
[[Thailand]] is a "3rd party partner" of the NSA along with nine other nations.&lt;ref name=Heise&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell |first1=Duncan|title=Paper 1: Echelon and its role in COMINT|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/7/7747/1.html|website=heise online |access-date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are non-English-speaking countries that have made security agreements for the exchange of SIGINT raw material and end product reports.

Thailand is the site of at least two US SIGINT collection stations. One is at the [[US Embassy]] in [[Bangkok]], a joint NSA-[[CIA]] Special Collection Service (SCS) unit. It presumably eavesdrops on foreign embassies, governmental communications, and other targets of opportunity.&lt;ref name=Electrospaces-2014-07-17&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA's global interception network |url=http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/12/nsas-global-interception-network.html|website=electrospaces.net|access-date=March 11, 2015|date=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second installation is a FORNSAT (foreign satellite interception) station in the Thai city of [[Khon Kaen]]. It is codenamed INDRA, but has also been referred to as LEMONWOOD.&lt;ref name=Electrospaces-2014-07-17 /&gt; The station is approximately {{convert|40|ha|acre}} in size and consists of a large 3,700–4,600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (40,000–50,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) operations building on the west side of the ops compound and four [[radome]]-enclosed [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic antennas]]. Possibly two of the radome-enclosed antennas are used for SATCOM intercept and two antennas used for relaying the intercepted material back to NSA. There is also a PUSHER-type circularly-disposed antenna array (CDAA) just north of the ops compound.&lt;ref name=MattAid&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA Satellite Communications SIGINT Station in Thailand Found|url=http://www.matthewaid.com/post/56608069320/nsa-satellite-communications-sigint-station-in |work=matthewaid.com/|access-date=March 11, 2015|date=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai map |url=https://www.google.com/maps/@16.4755559,102.8442837,171m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en|website=Google Maps|access-date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA activated Khon Kaen in October 1979. Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese army]] and [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|air force]] units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in [[Yunnan]] Province. In the late 1970s, the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia Camp, Hawaii|Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix Field Engineering Corp.]] whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.&lt;ref name=MattAid /&gt;

According to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.&lt;ref name=MattAid /&gt;

The base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.&lt;ref name=MattAid /&gt;
== Research and development ==
NSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.

Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|access-date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data Encryption Standard ===
{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}
[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]

NSA was embroiled in some controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community.&lt;ref name=outofthecloset&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cryptome.org/2021/04/Joseph-Meyer-IEEE-1977.pdf |title=The NSA Comes Out of the Closet: The Debate over Public Cryptography in the Inman Era (U)  |last=Author redacted |work=Cryptologic Quarterly| publisher=U.S. National Security Agency|date=circa 1983, partially declassified April 21, 2021|quote=Public cryptography issues were overwhelming Inman and the NSA. (p.12)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component—the so-called [[S-box]]es—had been altered to insert a "[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against [[differential cryptanalysis]], a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the IBM DES team.

=== Advanced Encryption Standard ===
{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}
The involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), was limited to hardware performance testing (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES competition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardware Performance Simulations of Round 2 Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithms|author=Weeks, Bryan|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|access-date=June 29, 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024234406/http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA-approved systems.&lt;ref name="suiteB"&gt;"the NIST standards that define Suite B..." in {{cite web|title=Suite B Cryptography / Cryptographic Interoperability|url=https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|publisher=National Security Agency|access-date=June 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101091229/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSA has specified [[NSA Suite A Cryptography|Suite A]] and [[NSA Suite B Cryptography|Suite B]] cryptographic algorithm suites to be used in U.S. government systems; the Suite B algorithms are a subset of those previously specified by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] and are expected to serve for most information protection purposes, while the Suite A algorithms are secret and are intended for especially high levels of protection.&lt;ref name="suiteB" /&gt;

=== SHA ===
The widely used [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]] hash functions were designed by NSA. SHA-1 is a slight modification of the weaker [[SHA-0]] algorithm, also designed by NSA in 1993. This small modification was suggested by NSA two years later, with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security. An attack for SHA-0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers. Because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in SHA-1, NIST deprecates its use for [[digital signature]]s, and approves only the newer SHA-2 algorithms for such applications from 2013 on.&lt;ref&gt;Draft NIST SP 800-131, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new hash standard, [[SHA-3]], has recently been selected through the [[NIST hash function competition|competition]] concluded October 2, 2012 with the selection of [[SHA-3|Keccak]] as the algorithm. The process to select SHA-3 was similar to the one held in choosing the AES, but some doubts have been cast over it,&lt;ref name="cdt.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorenzo |first=Joseph |url=https://www.cdt.org/blogs/joseph-lorenzo-hall/2409-nist-sha-3 |title=What the heck is going on with NIST's cryptographic standard, SHA-3? &amp;#124; Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |publisher=Cdt.org |date=September 24, 2013 |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/marshray/status/380800393367674880 |title=Twitter / marshray: Believe it or not, NIST is |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since fundamental modifications have been made to Keccak in order to turn it into a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzRYQSHuuMYOQXdHWkRiZXlURVE/ |title=kelsey-invited-ches-0820.pdf – Google Drive |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes potentially undermine the cryptanalysis performed during the competition and reduce the security levels of the algorithm.&lt;ref name="cdt.org" /&gt;

=== Clipper chip ===
{{Main|Clipper chip}}
Because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of [[Telephone tapping|wiretaps]], NSA proposed the concept of [[key escrow]] in 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baker, Stewart A.|title= Don't Worry Be Happy |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.06/nsa.clipper_pr.html|journal=Wired|volume= 2 |issue=6|access-date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Escrow, Key Recovery, Trusted Third Parties &amp; Govt.

=== Dual EC DRBG random number generator cryptotrojan ===
{{Main|Dual EC DRBG}}

NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called [[Dual EC DRBG]] in the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s 2007 guidelines. This led to speculation of a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRNG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024090318/http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |url-status=live|title=Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard? |first=Bruce |last=Schneier |author-link=Bruce Schneier|magazine=Wired News|date=November 15, 2007|access-date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic research ===
NSA has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix ''MDA904'', resulting in over 3,000 papers {{as of|2007|10|11|lc=y|df=US|post=.}} NSA/CSS has, at times, attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography; for example, the [[Khufu and Khafre]] block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an NSA request to do so. In response to a [[Freedom of information in the United States|FOIA]] lawsuit, in 2013 the NSA released the 643-page research paper titled, "Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/Untangling_the_Web.pdf |title=Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research |author1=Robyn Winder |author2=Charlie Speight |name-list-style=amp |work=National Security Agency Public Information |date=April 19, 2013 |access-date=May 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509043240/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/Untangling_the_Web.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; written and compiled by NSA employees to assist other NSA workers in searching for information of interest to the agency on the public Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/05/nsa-manual-on-hacking-internet/ |title=Use These Secret NSA Google Search Tips to Become Your Own Spy Agency|last=Zetter |first=Kim |work=Wired Magazine |date=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patents ===
NSA has the ability to file for a patent from the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] under [[gag order]]. Unlike normal patents, these are not revealed to the public and do not expire. However, if the Patent Office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party, they will reveal NSA's patent and officially grant it to NSA for the full term on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneier|first=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography, Second Edition|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1996|pages=609–610|isbn=978-0-471-11709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of NSA's published patents describes a method of [[geolocation|geographically locating]] an individual computer site in an Internet-like network, based on the [[lag|latency]] of multiple network connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|title=United States Patent 6,947,978 – Method for geolocating logical network addresses |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F6947978|date=September 20, 2005|access-date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no public patent exists, NSA is reported to have used a similar locating technology called trilateralization that allows real-time tracking of an individual's location, including altitude from ground level, using data obtained from cellphone towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/us/revelations-give-look-at-spy-agencys-wider-reach.html?pagewanted=all |title=How the U.S. Uses Technology to Mine More Data More Quickly |author=[[James Risen]] and [[Eric Lichtblau]] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 10, 2013 |access-date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insignia and memorials ==
[[File:National Security Agency.svg|100px|right]]
The [[heraldic]] insignia of NSA consists of an [[bald eagle|eagle]] inside a circle, grasping a [[key (lock)|key]] in its talons.&lt;ref name=FAQ9 /&gt; The eagle represents the agency's national mission.&lt;ref name=FAQ9 /&gt; Its breast features a shield with bands of red and white, taken from the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and representing Congress.&lt;ref name=FAQ9 /&gt; The key is taken from the emblem of [[Saint Peter]] and represents security.&lt;ref name=FAQ9&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/faqs/about_nsa.shtml#about9|title=Frequently Asked Questions About NSA: 9.

== Controversy and litigation ==
{{main|Mass surveillance in the United States}}
In the United States, at least since 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=dlj Echelon and the Legal Restraints on Signals Intelligence: A Need For Reevalualtion] by Lawrence D.

Sanger of ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically phone records. The government was not analyzing the phone records as of early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/nsa-phone-records-program-shut-down.html|title=Disputed N.S.A.

=== Warrantless wiretaps ===
{{Main|NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)}}

On December 16, 2005, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that, under [[White House]] pressure and with an [[executive order]] from President [[George W. Bush]], the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining [[warrant (law)|warrants]] from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a secret court created for that purpose under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA).&lt;ref name="NYTWarrantless"&gt;[[James Risen]] &amp; [[Eric Lichtblau]] (December 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

One such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army [[513th Military Intelligence Brigade]]. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the [[201st Expeditionary Military Intelligence Brigade|201st Military Intelligence Battalion]]. Conversations of citizens of the U.S. were intercepted, along with those of other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB23/index2.html |title=Gwu.edu |publisher=Gwu.edu |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the surveillance program claim that the President has [[Unitary executive theory|executive authority]] to order such action, arguing that laws such as FISA are overridden by the President's Constitutional powers. In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]], although the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'', [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Anna Diggs Taylor]] concluded that NSA's warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional. On July 6, 2007, the [[6th Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated the decision on the grounds that the ACLU lacked standing to bring the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/nsa/aclunsa70607opn.pdf |title=6th Circuit Court of Appeals Decision |access-date=October 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053024/http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/nsa/aclunsa70607opn.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2006, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] filed a lawsuit, [[CCR v. Bush]], against the [[George W. Bush]] Presidency. The lawsuit challenged the National Security Agency's (NSA's) surveillance of people within the U.S., including the interception of CCR emails without securing a warrant first.&lt;ref name=TheJurist200705may21&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/05/ex-guantanamo-lawyers-sue-for.php |date=May 19, 2007 |title=Ex-Guantanamo lawyers sue for recordings of client meetings |author=Mike Rosen-Molina |publisher=[[The Jurist]] |access-date=May 22, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502051556/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/05/ex-guantanamo-lawyers-sue-for.php |archive-date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CcrVBushDocket&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/ccr-v.-bush |title=CCR v.

As a result of the [[USA Freedom Act]] passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in June 2015, the NSA had to shut down its bulk phone surveillance program on November 29 of the same year. The USA Freedom Act forbids the NSA to collect metadata and content of phone calls unless it has a warrant for terrorism investigation. In that case, the agency must ask the [[Telephone company|telecom companies]] for the record, which will only be kept for six months. The NSA's use of large telecom companies to assist it with its surveillance efforts has caused several privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2019-10-01|title=The Missing Regulatory State: Monitoring Businesses in an Age of Surveillance|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/678|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1563}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1568-69}}

In May 2008, [[Mark Klein]], a former [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] employee, alleged that his company had cooperated with NSA in installing [[Narus (company)|Narus]] hardware to replace the FBI [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] program, to monitor network communications including traffic between U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 16, 2007|title=For Your Eyes Only?|journal=[[NOW on PBS|NOW]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/307/index.html}} on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data mining ===
NSA was reported in 2008 to use its computing capability to analyze "transactional" data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies, which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities. As part of this effort, NSA now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic email data, web addresses from Internet searches, bank transfers, credit-card transactions, travel records, and telephone data, according to current and former intelligence officials interviewed by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. The sender, recipient, and subject line of emails can be included, but the content of the messages or of phone calls are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120511973377523845 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124141023/http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120511973377523845.html |archive-date=January 24, 2009 |title=NSA's Domestic Spying Grows As Agency Sweeps Up Data |first=Siobahn|last=Gorman|publisher=The Wall Street Journal Online|date=March 10, 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Parallel construction#Parallel construction in the United States Drug Enforcement Administration}}
In August 2013 it was revealed that a 2005 IRS training document showed that NSA intelligence intercepts and wiretaps, both foreign and domestic, were being supplied to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and were illegally used to launch criminal investigations of US citizens. Law enforcement agents were directed to conceal how the investigations began and recreate an apparently legal investigative trail by re-obtaining the same evidence by other means.&lt;ref&gt;John Shiffman and Kristina Cooke (August 5, 2013) ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805 Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814032628/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805 |date=2013-08-14 }}''.

=== Section 215 metadata collection ===
On April 25, 2013, the NSA obtained a court order requiring [[Verizon]]'s Business Network Services to provide metadata on all calls in its system to the NSA "on an ongoing daily basis" for a three-month period, as reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' on June 6, 2013. This information includes "the numbers of both parties on a call&amp;nbsp;... location data, call duration, unique identifiers, and the time and duration of all calls" but not "[t]he contents of the conversation itself". The order relies on the so-called "business records" provision of the Patriot Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Greenwald |title=Revealed: NSA collecting phone records of millions of Americans daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order |access-date=June 6, 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=June 6, 2013|author-link=Glenn Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-06-05 /&gt;

In August 2013, following the Snowden leaks, new details about the NSA's data mining activity were revealed. Reportedly, the majority of emails into or out of the United States are captured at "selected communications links" and automatically analyzed for keywords or other "selectors". Emails that do not match are deleted.&lt;ref name="SavageBroaderSifting"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/us/broader-sifting-of-data-abroad-is-seen-by-nsa.html |title=N.S.A.

The utility of such a massive metadata collection in preventing terrorist attacks is disputed. Many studies reveal the dragnet like system to be ineffective. One such report, released by the [[New America Foundation]] concluded that after an analysis of 225 terrorism cases, the NSA  "had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2014"&gt;Nakashima, Ellen.

=== Responsibility for international ransomware attack ===
An exploit dubbed [[EternalBlue]], which was claimed to have been created by the NSA by hacker group [[The Shadow Brokers]] and whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]], was used in the unprecedented worldwide [[WannaCry ransomware attack]] in May 2017. The exploit had been leaked online by a hacking group, The Shadow Brokers, nearly a month prior to the attack. A number of experts have pointed the finger at the NSA's non-disclosure of the underlying vulnerability, and their loss of control over the EternalBlue attack tool that exploited it. Edward Snowden said that if the NSA had "[[Responsible disclosure|privately disclosed]] the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, [the attack] might not have happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/12/global-cyber-attack-ransomware-nsa-uk-nhs |title=Massive ransomware cyber-attack hits 74 countries around the world|first1=Julia Carrie|last1=Wong |first2=Olivia|last2=Solon |date=12 May 2017|access-date=12 May 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia co-founder, [[Jimmy Wales]], stated that he joined "with Microsoft and the other leaders of the industry in saying this is a huge screw-up by the government ... the moment the NSA found it, they should have notified Microsoft so they could quietly issue a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] and really chivvy people along, long before it became a huge problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kharpal |first1=Arjun |title=Cyberattack that hit 200,000 users was 'huge screw-up' by government, Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales says|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/19/wannacry-cyberattack-nsa-wikipedia-jimmy-wales.html|access-date=2 June 2017|publisher=CNBC|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Michelle Obama email hack===
Former employee David Evenden, who had left the NSA to work for US defense contractor Cyperpoint at a position in the [[United Arab Emirates]], was tasked with hacking UAE neighbor [[Qatar]] in 2015 to determine if they were funding terrorist group [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. He quit the company after learning his team had hacked Obama's email exchanges with Qatari Sheikha [[Moza bint Nasser]], just prior to the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]]'s visit to [[Doha]].&lt;ref name=NYT-06-02-2021&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/technology/cyber-hackers-usa.html|title=How the United States Lost to Hackers|access-date=6 February 2021|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Everden's return to the US, he reported his experiences to the [[FBI]]. The incident highlights a growing trend of former NSA employees and contractors leaving the agency to start up their own firms, and then hiring out to countries like [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]] and even [[Russia]], a country involved in [[Cyberwarfare_by_Russia#United_States|numerous cyberattacks against the US]].&lt;ref name=NYT-06-02-2021 /&gt;
