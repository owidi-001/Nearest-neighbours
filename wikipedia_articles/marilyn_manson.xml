'''Marilyn Manson''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed by namesake lead singer [[Marilyn Manson]] and guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], in 1989. Originally named '''Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids''', they gained a local [[cult following]] in [[South Florida]] in the early 1990s with their theatrical live performances. In 1993, they were the first act signed to [[Trent Reznor]]'s [[Nothing Records]] label. Until 1996, the name of each member was created by combining the first name of a female [[sex symbol]] and the last name of a serial killer, for example [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Charles Manson]]. Their lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the eponymous lead singer is the only remaining original member.

In the past, band members dressed in outlandish makeup and costumes, and engaged in intentionally [[shock value|shocking]] behavior both onstage and off. Their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs, while their live performances were frequently called offensive and [[obscenity|obscene]]. On several occasions, protests and petitions led to the group being blocked from performing, with at least three US states passing legislation banning the group from performing at [[State ownership|state-owned]] venues. They released a number of [[Music recording sales certification|platinum-selling albums]], including ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996) and ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998). These albums, along with their highly stylized music videos and worldwide touring, brought public recognition to Marilyn Manson. In 1999, news media, infamously, falsely [[Marilyn Manson–Columbine High School massacre controversy|blamed the band for influencing]] [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|the perpetrators]] of the [[Columbine High School massacre]].

As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of [[MTV]], in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as "the only true artist today".&lt;ref name="TrueArtist" /&gt; Marilyn Manson is widely regarded as being one of the most iconic and controversial figures in [[rock music]], with the band and its lead singer influencing numerous other groups and musicians, both in metal-associated acts and also in wider popular culture. [[VH1]] ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their ''100 Great Artists of Hard Rock''. They were inducted into the ''[[Kerrang!]]'' Hall of Fame in 2000, and have been nominated for four [[Grammy Award]]s. In the U.S., the band has seen ten of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Marilyn Manson have sold in excess of 50 million records worldwide.

The stage names adopted by each member were representative of a concept the band considered central: the [[dichotomy]] of [[good and evil]], and the existence of both, together, in every whole. "[[Marilyn Monroe]] had a dark side", explained Manson in his autobiography, "just as [[Charles Manson]] has a good, intelligent side."{{sfn|Manson|Strauss|1998|pp=85, 87, 90}} Over the next six years, all of the band's members would adopt names that combined the first name of a female [[sex symbol]] and the surname of a serial killer.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Reighley|first=Kurt|title=Marilyn Manson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCZfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin, New York|page=15|date=1998|isbn=9780312181338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of both Monroe and Manson, as well as of other famous and infamous figures, were common in the band's early promotional materials.{{sfn|Manson|Strauss|1998|pp=85, 87, 90}}

Reznor offered the band a contract with the label, as well as an opening slot supporting Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming "[[Self Destruct Tour]]".{{sfn|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=143}}&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; After accepting both offers, recording sessions for their debut studio album began in July 1993 with [[Swans (band)|Swans]] producer [[Roli Mosimann]] at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida. Recording a selection of new songs along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire, the first version of their debut, titled ''[[The Manson Family Album]]'', was completed by the end of the month. However, it was not well received.&lt;ref name="LoudwirePortrait"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/marilyn-manson-portrait-of-an-american-family-album-anniversary/ |title=21 Years Ago: Marilyn Manson Issues 'Portrait of an American Family' |author=Wiederhorn, Jon |work=[[Loudwire]] |publisher=[[Townsquare Media]] |access-date=March 24, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501054342/http://loudwire.com/marilyn-manson-portrait-of-an-american-family-album-anniversary/ |archive-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's members, along with Reznor, criticized Mosimann's production as being flat, lifeless and poorly representative of the band's live performances.{{sfn|Manson|Strauss|1998|p=144}} At the same time, Gidget Gein had begun to lose control of his addiction to heroin.&lt;ref name="LoudwirePortrait" /&gt; Before reworking the album, the band played two shows in Florida under the name Mrs. Scabtree. This band featured Manson on drums, Gacy on keyboard, Berkowitz on guitar, and [[Jessicka]] from [[Jack Off Jill]] sharing vocal duties with [[Jeordie White]] of Miami [[thrash metal|thrash]] band Amboog-a-Lard.

Reznor agreed to rework production of ''The Manson Family Album'' in October 1993 at [[Record Plant#Los Angeles|Record Plant Studios]] in Los Angeles.

The band's second studio album, ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'', was released on October 8, 1996. It was recorded at [[Nothing Studios]] with Reznor, Manson, [[Sean Beavan]] and former [[Skinny Puppy]] member and longtime producer [[Dave Ogilvie]] sharing co-production duties; members of both Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails took part in its recording.&lt;ref name="LoudwireAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/marilyn-manson-antichrist-superstar-album-anniversary/ |title=19 Years Ago: Marilyn Manson Makes Creative Leap With 'Antichrist Superstar' |author=Childers, Chad |work=[[Loudwire]] |publisher=[[Townsquare Media]] |date=October 8, 2015 |access-date=March 31, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429062130/http://loudwire.com/marilyn-manson-antichrist-superstar-album-anniversary/ |archive-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of making the album was a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving [[sleep deprivation]] and near-constant drug use, in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to the album's content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high. Daisy Berkowitz, the band's founding guitarist, departed the band partway through the album's recording process, with Twiggy performing much of the album's guitar work.&lt;ref name="MTVAntichrist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/508213/recording-antichrist-superstar-a-trying-experience-for-manson/ |title=Recording Antichrist Superstar A "Trying Experience" For Manson |author=Jackson, Alex |work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] |date=September 10, 1996 |access-date=March 31, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610103331/http://www.mtv.com/news/508213/recording-antichrist-superstar-a-trying-experience-for-manson/ |archive-date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Linton responded to an advert seeking Berkowitz's replacement. He would form a close relationship with Madonna Wayne Gacy, who was responsible for the inclusion of one of the major sources of inspiration for the album: [[Kabbalah]]. Breaking with the six-year tradition of naming band members after female icons and serial killers, [[Zim Zum]] was chosen as Linton's stage name. It was derived from the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] concept of [[Tzimtzum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Gerri|last=Miller |date=1998-12-01 |title=Zim Zum Speaks |magazine=[[Metal Edge]] |publisher=[[Zenbu Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Beautiful People (song)|The Beautiful People]]" was released as the album's lead single.

[The album's deepest elements] are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with ''Holy Wood'', then ''Mechanical Animals'' really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then ''Antichrist Superstar'' is where you're given a choice to decide if you're going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over.

Eschewing the lyrical depth and symbolism found on ''Holy Wood'', the album was relatively straightforward: in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized work to the ''[[Degenerate art|Entartete Kunst]]'' banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://derstandard.at/1289559/Marilyn-Manson-ueber-Stimmung-in-USA-und-Entartete-Kunst |title=Marilyn Manson über Stimmung in USA und "Entartete Kunst" |language=de |trans-title=Marilyn Manson on the mood in the US and "Degenerate Art" |work=[[Der Standard]] |date=May 5, 2003 |access-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701173847/http://derstandard.at/1289559/Marilyn-Manson-ueber-Stimmung-in-USA-und-Entartete-Kunst |archive-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrically, Manson utilizes the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|narrative mode of stream of consciousness]] throughout the album to examine the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] in times of crisis, specifically focusing on the mindset of [[lunatic]]s and children, as, according to Manson, "they don't follow the rules [of society]."&lt;ref name="MTVGoldenAge"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1471848/marilyn-manson-draws-from-dreams-lunatics-for-golden-age-of-grotesque/ |title=Marilyn Manson Draws From Dreams, Lunatics For Golden Age Of Grotesque |author=Wiederhorn, Jon |work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] |date=May 12, 2003 |access-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610110050/http://www.mtv.com/news/1471848/marilyn-manson-draws-from-dreams-lunatics-for-golden-age-of-grotesque/ |archive-date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several songs incorporate elements commonly found in [[Playground song|playground chants]] and [[nursery rhyme]]s, which Manson would "pervert into something ugly and lurid."&lt;ref name="MTVGoldenAge" /&gt; The work of [[Kurt Weill]] was also noted as an influence, along with the [[lucid dream]]s the singer was having during its production, with Manson explaining that he would "wake up and say, 'I want to write a song that sounds like a stampeding elephant,' or 'I want to write a song that sounds like a burning piano.'"&lt;ref name="MTVGoldenAge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marilyn-manson-the-golden-age-of-grotesque-cover-art-posted-online/ |title=Marilyn Manson: 'The Golden Age Of Grotesque' Cover Art Posted Online |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=February 19, 2003 |access-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625144224/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marilyn-manson-the-golden-age-of-grotesque-cover-art-posted-online/ |archive-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
 |quote =It's clear Manson isn't merely a freak rocker, media manipulator or one-trick pony. The secret to his longevity lies not in his sometimes schlocky image, but in the content of his work. Not only are his songs sonically compelling and his themes fresh and intriguing, but his actions speak louder than his words. His imagery, sounds and theatrics all still have a point, and like all true artists, he continues to wring significant messages from the lining of his contorted innards. Manson doesn't just bleed for his art. He drinks, pukes, fornicates and risks his life for it.
