Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when [[block parties]] became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties DJs played [[percussion|percussive]] breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a [[DJ mixer]] to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the other and extending the "break".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/11/hey-whats-that-sound-turntablism|title=Hey, what's that sound: Turntablism|last=McNamee|first=David|date=January 11, 2010|work=The Guardian |access-date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and [[drum machine]]s became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beatmatching]] developed along with the breaks and Jamaican [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]], a chanting vocal style, was used over the beats. [[Rapping]] developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized [[beat (music)|beat]].

Hip hop music was not officially recorded for play on radio or television until 1979, largely due to poverty during the genre's birth and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Dyson 2007, p. 6"&gt;[[Michael Eric Dyson|Dyson, Michael Eric]], 2007, ''Know What I Mean?: Reflections on Hip-Hop'', Basic Civitas Books, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old school hip hop]] was the first mainstream wave of the genre, marked by its [[disco]] influence and party-oriented lyrics. The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles and spread around the world. [[New school hip hop]] was the genre's second wave, marked by its [[electro music|electro]] sound, and led into [[Golden age hip hop]], an innovative period between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s that also developed hip hop's own [[album era]]. The [[gangsta rap]] [[subgenre]], focused on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city African-American youth, gained popularity at this time. [[West Coast hip hop]] was dominated by [[G-funk]] in the early-mid 1990s, while [[East Coast hip hop]] was dominated by [[jazz rap]], [[alternative hip hop]], and [[hardcore rap]]. Hip hop continued to diversify at this time with other regional styles emerging, such as [[Southern rap]] and [[Atlanta hip hop]]. Hip hop became a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the top-selling music genre by 1999.

The popularity of hip hop music continued through the late 1990s to mid-2000s "bling era" with hip hop influences increasingly finding their way into other genres of popular music, such as [[neo soul]], [[nu metal]], and [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]]. The United States also saw the success of regional styles such as [[crunk]], a Southern genre that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics, and [[alternative hip hop]] began to secure a place in the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of its artists. During the late 2000s and early 2010s "blog era", rappers were able to build up a following through online methods of music distribution, such as social media and blogs, and mainstream hip hop took on a more melodic, sensitive direction following the commercial decline of gangsta rap. The [[Trap rap|trap]] and [[mumble rap]] subgenres have become the most popular form of hip hop during the mid-late 2010s and early 2020s. In 2017, rock music was usurped by hip hop as the most popular genre in the United States.

The words "hip" and "hop" have a long history behind the two words being used together. In the 1950s, older folks referred to teen house parties as "hippity hops".&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chang|first=Jeff|date=April 10, 2016|title=How Hip-Hop Got Its Name|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/how-hip-hop-got-its-name-a3529fa4fbf1|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=Medium|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the term ''[[hip hop]]'' is often credited to Keith Cowboy, [[rapper]] with [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name="furious5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm|title=Keith Cowboy – The Real Mc Coy|date=March 17, 2006|access-date=January 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317071002/http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm|archive-date=March 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Lovebug Starski]], Keith Cowboy, and [[DJ Hollywood]] used the term when the music was still known as ''[[disco|disco rap]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsfXdMRS4c|title=Afrika Bambaataa talks about the roots of Hip Hop|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=February 25, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army, by [[scat singing]] the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the [[rhythm]]ic cadence of soldiers marching.&lt;ref name="furious5" /&gt; Cowboy later worked the "hip hop" cadence into a part of his stage performance.

There are disagreements about whether or not the terms "hip hop" and "rap" can be used interchangeably. This even happens amongst hip-hop's most knowledgeable writers, performers, and listeners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most common view that is seen, is that hip-hop is a cultural movement that emerged in the South Bronx in New York City during the 1970s, with MCing (or rapping) being one of the primary four elements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hip hop's other three essential elements are graffiti art (or aerosol art), break dancing, and DJing. Rap music has become by far the most celebrated expression of hip hop culture, largely as a result of its being the easiest to market to a mass audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==1973–1979: Early years==
===Origins===
Hip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s in New York City from the multicultural exchange between African-American youth from the United States and young immigrants and children of immigrants from countries in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Castillo-Garsow 2016 ix"&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Verdad: An International Dialogue on Hip Hop Latinidades|last1=Castillo-Garsow|first1=Melissa|last2=Nichols|first2=Jason|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8142-1315-5|location=Columbus|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop music in its infancy has been described as an outlet and a voice for the disenfranchised youth of marginalized backgrounds and low-income areas, as the hip hop culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of their lives.&lt;ref name="Metaphorical Conceptions3"&gt;Crossley, Scott. "Metaphorical Conceptions in Hip-Hop Music", ''[[African American Review]]'', St Louis University Press, 2005. '''pp. 501–502'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hip Hop in History3"&gt;Alridge D, Steward J. "Introduction: Hip Hop in History: Past, Present, and Future", ''[[Journal of African American History]]'', 2005. '''pp. 190'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the people who helped establish hip hop culture, including [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[DJ Disco Wiz]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] were of Latin American or [[Caribbean]] origin.

It is hard to pinpoint the exact musical influences that most affected the sound and culture of early hip hop because of the multicultural nature of New York City. Hip hop's early pioneers were influenced by a mix of music from their cultures and the cultures they were exposed to as a result of the diversity of U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/CA/00/40/02/69/00001/PDF.pdf|title="Yele, Yele": Caribbean Identity and the Rubric of Race in U.S-Based Hip-Hop|last=Ogbar|first=Jeffrey|date=May 2001|publisher=University of Florida Digital Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City experienced a heavy Jamaican hip hop influence during the 1990s. This influence was brought on by cultural shifts particularly because of the heightened immigration of Jamaicans to New York City and the American-born Jamaican youth who were coming of age during the 1990s.

[[File:Dj Kool Herc-03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[DJ Kool Herc]], a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] DJ, is recognized as one of the earliest hip hop DJs and artists.

In the 1970s, [[block parties]] were increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African-American, Caribbean and Latino youth residing in the [[Bronx]]. Block parties incorporated DJs, who played popular genres of music, especially [[funk]] and [[soul music]]. Due to the positive reception, DJs began isolating the [[Percussion|percussive]] breaks of popular songs. This technique was common in Jamaican [[dub music]],&lt;ref name="dub music2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/music-genres/reggae-dub/3-What-is-Dub-music-anyway-Reggae.html|title=What is "Dub" music anyway? (Reggae)|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org|publisher=Stason.org|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely introduced into New York by immigrants from the Caribbean, including [[DJ Kool Herc]], one of the pioneers of hip hop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,55635,00.html|title='Hip-Hop Nation' Is Exhibit A for America's Latest Cultural Revolution|author=Karon, Tony|date=September 22, 2000|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=May 27, 2014|archive-date=November 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127032842/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,55635,00.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992268,00.html|title=Rock's New Spin|author=Farley, Christopher John|date=October 18, 1999|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=May 27, 2014|archive-date=August 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825042503/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992268,00.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the percussive breaks in funk, soul and [[disco]] records were generally short, Herc and other DJs began using two turntables to extend the breaks. Herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the Jamaican tradition of impromptu [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]], a spoken type of boastful poetry and speech over music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|Chang|2005|p=??}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was the DJ at his sister's back-to-school party. He extended the beat of a record by using two record players, isolating the percussion "breaks" by using a [[DJ mixer|mixer]] to switch between the two records. Herc's experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or "[[scratching]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigation/birthplace-of-hip-hop/|title=Birthplace Of Hip Hop – History Detectives – PBS|publisher=PBS|access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing (also called MCing or rapping). Emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of [[rhyme]]s and wordplay, delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a [[beats (music)|beat]]. This spoken style was influenced by the [[African American music|African American]] style of "capping", a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hip hop: Origins, Characteristics and Creative Processes|last=Neumann|first=Fredreich|year=2000|journal=The World of Music|jstor=41699313|volume=42|issue=1|pages=51–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps, rival "posses" (groups), uptown "throw-downs", and political and social commentary—were all long present in African American music. MCing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of "toasting" songs packed with a mix of boasting, 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, socially conscious style. The role of the MC originally was as a [[Master of Ceremonies]] for a DJ dance event. The MC would introduce the DJ and try to pump up the audience. The MC spoke between the DJ's songs, urging everyone to get up and dance. MCs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd. Eventually, this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken, rhythmic wordplay, and rhyming, which became rapping.

By 1979 hip hop music had become a mainstream genre. It spread across the world in the 1990s with controversial "gangsta" rap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acesandeighths.com/hip_hop.html|title=The History of Hip Hop Music|website=acesandeighths.com|access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herc also developed upon [[break (music)|break-beat]] [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejaying]],&lt;ref name="The guide"&gt;Browne, P. ''The guide to United States popular culture'' Popular Press, 2001. p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; where the breaks of [[funk]] songs—the part most suited to dance, usually percussion-based—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties. This form of music playback, using hard funk and rock, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated, rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping. He dubbed his dancers "break-boys" and "break-girls", or simply [[breakdance|b-boys]] and b-girls. According to Herc, "breaking" was also street slang for "getting excited" and "acting energetically".&lt;ref&gt;Kool Herc, in Israel (director), ''The Freshest Kids: A History of the B-Boy'', QD3, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

DJs such as [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], [[DJ Grandmaster Flash|Grandmaster Flash]], and [[Jazzy Jay]] refined and developed the use of [[breakbeats]], including [[scratching|cutting and scratching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daveyd.com/raptitle.html|title=The History Of Hip Hop|website=daveyd.com|access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As turntable manipulation continued to evolve a new technique that came from it was needle dropping. Needle dropping was created by Grandmaster Flash, it is prolonged short drum breaks by playing two copies of a record simultaneously and moving the needle on one turntable back to the start of the break while the other played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=hip-hop {{!}} Definition, History, Culture, &amp; Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/hip-hop|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach used by Herc was soon widely copied, and by the late 1970s, DJs were releasing [[12-inch single|12-inch]] records where they would rap to the beat. Popular tunes included [[Kurtis Blow]]'s "[[The Breaks (song)|The Breaks]]" and The [[Sugarhill Gang]]'s "[[Rapper's Delight]]".&lt;ref name="Nile"/&gt; Herc and other DJs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Bronx, New York, now officially a historic building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Jennifer 8.|author-link=Jennifer 8.

[[Street gang]]s were prevalent in the poverty of the South Bronx, and much of the graffiti, rapping, and [[b-boying]] at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and one-upmanship of street gangs. Sensing that gang members' often violent urges could be turned into creative ones, Afrika Bambaataa founded the [[Universal Zulu Nation|Zulu Nation]], a loose confederation of street-dance crews, graffiti artists, and rap musicians. By the late 1970s, the culture had gained media attention, with ''Billboard'' magazine printing an article titled "B Beats Bombarding Bronx", commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as Kool Herc.&lt;ref name="That's the joint"&gt;Forman M; M.

[[DJ Kool Herc]]'s house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues to accommodate more people. Hosted in parks, these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers, where "instead of getting into trouble on the streets, teens now had a place to expend their pent-up energy."&lt;ref name="Chang 62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chang|2007|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Tone, a member of the [[Cold Crush Brothers]], stated that "hip hop saved a lot of lives".&lt;ref name="Chang 62"/&gt; For inner-city youth, participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within America, and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture.

Boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], as an influential African-American celebrity, was widely covered in the media. Ali influenced several elements of hip hop music. Both in the boxing ring and in media interviews, Ali became known in the 1960s for being "rhyming trickster" in the 1960s. Ali used a "[[funk]]y delivery" for his comments, which included "boasts, comical [[Trash-talk|trash talk]], [and] the endless quotabl[e]" lines.&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/muhammad-ali-worlds-greatest-boxer-was-also-hip-hop-pioneer-20160604|title=Muhammad Ali: World's Greatest Boxer Was Also Hip-Hop Pioneer|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', his "[[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] skills" (a reference to a type of vocal improvisation in which lyrics are recited with no particular subject or structure) and his "rhymes, flow, and [[Braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]" would "one day become typical of [[Old school hip hop|old school]] MCs" like [[Run–D.M.C.]] and [[LL Cool J]],&lt;ref name="rollingstone2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/muhammad-ali-4-ways-he-changed-america-20160605|title=Muhammad Ali: 4 Ways He Changed America|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter citing Ali as an influence.&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"/&gt; Hip hop music in its infancy has been described as an outlet and a "voice" for the disenfranchised youth of low-income and marginalized economic areas,&lt;ref name="Metaphorical Conceptions3"/&gt; as the hip hop culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of their lives.&lt;ref name="Hip Hop in History3"/&gt;

Hip hop's early evolution occurred around the time that sampling technology and drum-machines became widely available to the general public at a cost that was affordable to the average consumer—not just professional studios. Drum-machines and samplers were combined in machines that came to be known as [[Music Production Center|MPC]]'s or '[[Music Production Center]]s', early examples of which would include the [[Linn 9000]]. The first sampler that was broadly adopted to create this new kind of music was the [[Mellotron]] used in combination with the [[TR-808]] drum machine. Mellotrons and Linn's were succeeded by the [[AKAI]], in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;"With the invention of sound recording, it was only a matter of time until the device which records itself becomes the instrument. The moment in popular culture a sound playback device became the instrument was in early hip-hop. The use of the turntable, and particularly two turntables, is characteristic. You could set up two turntables with two identical records, and keep a break going forever. So the birth of sampling coincided with the birth of...the idea of the loop."

Turntablist techniques – such as rhythmic "[[scratching]]" (pushing a record back and forth while the needle is in the groove to create new sounds and [[sound effect]]s, an approach attributed to [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=NPR|title=NPR: The Birth of Rap: A Look Back|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7550286|first=David|last=Dye|date=February 22, 2007|access-date=April 2, 2018|archive-date=April 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424150135/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7550286|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic1"&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[beat mixing]] and/or [[beatmatching]], and [[beat juggling]] – eventually developed along with the percussion breaks, creating a musical [[accompaniment]] or base that could be rapped over in a manner similar to [[signifying]]. As well, the art of Jamaican [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]], a style of talking or chanting into a microphone, often in a boastful style, while beats play over a [[sound reinforcement system|sound system]], was an important influence on the development of hip hop music. Toasting is another influence found in Jamaican [[dub music]].&lt;ref name="dub music2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="more dub music"&gt;{{cite web|last=Philen|first=Robert|url=http://robertphilen.blogspot.com/2007/11/mythic-music-stockhausen-davis-and.html|title=Robert Philen's Blog: Mythic Music: Stockhausen, Davis and Macero, Dub, Hip Hop, and Lévi-Strauss|publisher=Robertphilen.blogspot.com|date=November 5, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of rapping===
[[File:HERO Performing at thrill lounge in Huntsville, AL.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|MC Hero performing rhythmic rhyming known as "[[rapping]]" in Huntsville, Alabama.]]
[[Rapping]], also referred to as [[MCing]] or emceeing, is a vocal style in which the artist speaks lyrically and rhythmically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized [[beat (music)|beat]]. Beats, almost always in 4/4 [[time signature]], can be created by [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and/or sequencing portions of other songs by a [[Hip hop production|producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/|title=A database of sampled music|publisher=WhoSampled|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Rappers may write, memorize, or [[Freestyle rap|improvise their lyrics]] and perform their works [[a cappella]] or to a beat. Hip hop music predates the introduction of rapping into hip hop culture, and rap vocals are absent from many hip hop tracks, such as "[[Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)]]" by [[Man Parrish]]; "[[Paid in Full (album)|Chinese Arithmetic]]" by [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]]; "Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)" and "We're Rocking the Planet" by [[Jerry Calliste, Jr.|Hashim]]; and "Destination Earth" by [[Newcleus]]. However, the majority of the genre has been accompanied by rap vocals, such as the Sci-fi influenced electro hip hop group [[Warp 9]].&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;Fitzpatrick, Rob, "The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 – It's A Beat Wave," May 14, 2014 [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221130138/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |date=December 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Female rappers appeared on the scene in the late 1970s and early 80s, including Bronx artist MC [[Sha-Rock]], member of the [[Funky Four Plus One]], credited with being the first female MC&lt;ref&gt;The Story of the Beginning and End of the First Hip Hop Female MC...Luminary Icon Sha-Rock [https://www.amazon.com/Story-Beginning-Female-MC-Luminary-Sha-Rock/dp/0977825841] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110005959/http://www.amazon.com/Story-Beginning-Female-MC-Luminary-Sha-Rock/dp/0977825841 |date=January 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Sequence]], a hip hop trio signed to [[Sugar Hill Records]], the first all female group to release a rap record, [[Funk You Up]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Jamaican origins of outdoor sound systems===
{{Further|Sound system (Jamaican)}}
[[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] at many stations were limited by the 'broadcast Day' as special licenses were required to transmit at night. Those that had such licenses were heard far out to sea and in the Caribbean, where [[Jocko Henderson]] and [[Joseph Deighton Gibson Jr.|Jockey Jack]] were American DJs who were listened to at night from broadcast transmitters located in Miami, Florida. Jocko came to have an outsized influence on Jamaican Emcees during the '50s as the R&amp;B music played on the Miami stations was different from that played on [[Jamaica Broadcasting Company|JBC]], which re-broadcast [[BBC]] and local music styles. In Jamaica, DJs would set up large roadside sound systems in towns and villages, playing music for informal gatherings, mostly folks who wandered down from country hills looking for excitement at the end of the week. There the DJs would allow 'Toasts' by an Emcee, which copied the style of the American DJs listened to on AM transistor radios. It was by this method that Jive talk, rapping and rhyming was transposed to the island and locally the style was transformed by 'Jamaican lyricism', or the local [[Jamaican Patois|patois]].

Hip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s in New York City from the multicultural exchange between African-American youth from the United States and young immigrants and children of immigrants from countries in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Castillo-Garsow 2016 ix"/&gt; What would be later described as 'block parties' in the US was a reality since the 1950s all over Jamaica, as MCs (called DJs in Jamaica) were talking and rapping over records at 'sound system' parties since at least 1949.&lt;ref&gt;See Steve Barrow and Peter Dalton's book ''The Rough Guide to Reggae'' (Rough Guides)&lt;/ref&gt; Some were influenced by the vocal style of the earliest African-American radio MCs (including [[Jocko Henderson]]'s ''Rocket Ship Show'' of the 1950s, which rhymed and was influenced by [[scat singing]]), which could be heard over the radio in Jamaica.

The first records by Jamaican DJs, including [[Sir Lord Comic]] (''The Great Wuga Wuga'', 1967) came as part of the local dance hall culture, which featured 'specials,' unique mixes or 'versions' pressed on soft discs or acetate discs, and rappers (called DJs) such as [[King Stitt]], Count Machuki, [[U-Roy]], [[I-Roy]], [[Big Youth]] and many others. Recordings of talk-over, which is a different style from the dancehall's DJ style, were also made by Jamaican artists such as [[Prince Buster]] and [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] (''Judge Dread'') as early as 1967, somehow rooted in the 'talking blues' tradition. The first full-length Jamaican DJ record was a duet on a Rastafarian topic by Kingston ghetto dwellers U-Roy and Peter Tosh named ''Righteous Ruler'' (produced by [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] in 1969). The first DJ hit record was ''Fire Corner'' by Coxsone's Downbeat sound system DJ, [[King Stitt]] that same year; 1970 saw a multitude of DJ hit records in the wake of U-Roy's early, massive hits, most famously ''Wake the Town'' and many others. As the tradition of remix (which also started in Jamaica where it was called 'version' and 'dub') developed, established young Jamaican DJ/rappers from that period, who had already been working for sound systems for years, were suddenly recorded and had many local hit records, widely contributing to the reggae craze triggered by Bob Marley's impact in the 1970s. The main Jamaican DJs of the early 1970s were [[King Stitt]], ''Samuel The First'', Count Machuki, Johnny Lover (who 'versioned' songs by [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] as early as 1971), Dave Barker, Scotty, Lloyd Young, Charlie Ace and others, as well as soon-to-be reggae stars [[U-Roy]], [[Dennis Alcapone]], [[I-Roy]], [[Prince Jazzbo]], [[Prince Far I]], [[Big Youth]] and [[Dillinger (musician)|Dillinger]]. Dillinger scored the first international rap hit record with ''Cocaine in my Brain'' in 1976 (based on the ''Do It Any Way You Wanna Do'' rhythm by [[The People's Choice (band)|People's Choice]] as re-recorded by [[Sly and Robbie]]), where he even used a New York accent, consciously aiming at the new NYC rap market. The Jamaican DJ dance music was deeply rooted in the sound system tradition that made music available to poor people in a very poor country where live music was only played in clubs and hotels patronized by the middle and upper classes. By 1973 Jamaican sound system enthusiast [[DJ Kool Herc]] moved to the Bronx, taking with him Jamaica's sound system culture, and teamed up with another Jamaican, Coke La Rock, at the mike. Although other influences, most notably musical sequencer [[Grandmaster Flowers]] of Brooklyn and [[Grand Wizzard Theodore|Grandwizard Theodore]] of the Bronx contributed to the birth of hip hop in New York, and although it was downplayed in most US books about hip hop, the main root of this sound system culture was Jamaican. The roots of rap in Jamaica are explained in detail in [[Bruno Blum]]'s book, 'Le Rap'.&lt;ref&gt;'Le Rap Est Né en Jamaïque' (Le Castor Astral, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

DJ Kool Herc and [[Coke La Rock]] provided an influence on the vocal style of rapping by delivering simple poetry verses over funk music breaks, after party-goers showed little interest in their previous attempts to integrate reggae-infused [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] into musical sets.&lt;ref name="dub music2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Hip Hop - Old School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncimusic.com/tutorial/history/hiphop/oldschool.html|title=History of Hip Hop – Old School|publisher=nciMUSIC|access-date=January 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714161251/http://www.ncimusic.com/tutorial/history/hiphop/oldschool.html|archive-date=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; DJs and [[MC]]s would often add call and response chants, often consisting of a basic chorus, to allow the performer to gather his thoughts (e.g. "one, two, three, y'all, to the beat"). Later, the MCs grew more varied in their vocal and rhythmic delivery, incorporating brief rhymes, often with a sexual or scatological theme, in an effort to differentiate themselves and to entertain the audience. These early raps incorporated the dozens, a product of African-American culture. Kool Herc &amp; the Herculoids were the first hip hop group to gain recognition in New York,&lt;ref name="History of Hip Hop - Old School"/&gt; but the number of MC teams increased over time.

Often these were collaborations between former [[gangs]], such as [[Afrikaa Bambaataa]]'s [[Universal Zulu Nation]]—now an international organization. [[Melle Mel]], a rapper with The [[Furious Five]] is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an "MC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2007/01/16/grand-master-mele-mel-gun-show-part-one/|title=Article about Mele Mel (Melle Mel)|website=AllHipHop.com|date=January 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s [[B-boying]] arose during block parties, as b-boys and b-girls got in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive and frenetic style. The style was documented for release to a worldwide audience for the first time in documentaries and movies such as ''[[Style Wars]]'', ''[[Wild Style]]'', and ''[[Beat Street]]''. The term "B-boy" was coined by DJ Kool Herc to describe the people who would wait for the [[break (music)|break]] section of the song, showing off athleticism, spinning on the stage to 'break-dance' in the distinctive, frenetic style.&lt;ref&gt;Schloss, J.G. (2009). ''Foundation:
b-boys, b-girls, and hip-hop culture in New York'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were some early MCs that recorded solo projects of note, such as [[DJ Hollywood]], [[Kurtis Blow]], and [[Spoonie Gee]], the frequency of solo artists did not increase until later with the rise of soloists with stage presence and drama, such as [[LL Cool J]]. Most early hip hop was dominated by groups where collaboration between the members was integral to the show.&lt;ref name="Toop"&gt;* [[Toop, David|David Toop]] (1984/1991/2000).

The earliest hip hop music was performed live, at house parties and block party events, and it was not recorded. Prior to 1979, recorded hip hop music consisted mainly of [[Public address|PA system soundboard]] recordings of live party shows and early hip hop [[mixtapes]] by DJs. Puerto Rican [[DJ Disco Wiz]] is credited as the first hip hop DJ to create a "mixed plate," or mixed dub recording, when, in 1977, he combined sound bites, special effects and paused beats to technically produce a sound recording.&lt;ref name="hess"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Mickey|last=Hess|title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=xxxiii|isbn=978-0-313-34323-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hip hop record is widely regarded to be [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s "[[Rapper's Delight]]", from 1979.

By the early 1980s, all the major elements and techniques of the hip hop genre were in place, and by 1982, the electronic (electro) sound had become the trend on the street and in dance clubs. New York City radio station WKTU featured [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Nunk (song)|Nunk]]," in a commercial to promote the station's signature sound of emerging hip hop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eteksciki.info/videos/WKTU|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702103900/http://www.eteksciki.info/videos/WKTU|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 2, 2013|title=eteksciki.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not yet mainstream, hip hop had begun to permeate the music scene outside of New York City; it could be found in cities as diverse as Los Angeles, [[Atlanta]], Chicago, Washington, D.C., [[Baltimore]], [[Dallas]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Antonio, TX|San Antonio]], Miami, [[Seattle]], [[St. Louis]], [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], and [[Toronto]].

Hip hop music became popular in Philadelphia in the late 1970s. The first released record was titled "Rhythm Talk", by [[Jocko Henderson]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' had dubbed Philadelphia the "Graffiti Capital of the World" in 1971. Philadelphia native DJ [[Lady B]] recorded "To the Beat Y'All" in 1979, and became the first female solo hip hop artist to record music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonym|url=http://hiphoponwax.blogspot.com/2006/10/lady-b-to-beat-yall.html|title=Hip Hop On Wax: Lady B – To The Beat Y'All|publisher=Hiphoponwax.blogspot.com|date=February 26, 2004|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schoolly D]], starting in 1984 and also from Philadelphia, began creating a style that would later be known as [[gangsta rap]].

===Influence of disco===
Hip hop music was influenced by [[disco music]], as disco also emphasized the key role of the DJ in creating tracks and mixes for dancers, and old school hip hop often used disco tracks as beats. At the same time however, hip hop music was also a backlash against certain subgenres of late 1970s disco. While the early disco was African-American and Italian-American-created [[underground music]] developed by DJs and producers for the dance club subculture, by the late 1970s, disco airwaves were dominated by mainstream, expensively [[record producer|recorded]] [[music industry]]-produced disco songs. According to [[Kurtis Blow]], the early days of hip hop were characterized by divisions between fans and detractors of disco music. Hip hop had largely emerged as "a direct response to the watered down, Europeanised, disco music that permeated the airwaves".&lt;ref&gt;nciMUSIC – History of Hip Hop [http://www.ncimusic.com/tutorial/history/hiphop/hiphop.html nciMUSIC.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210182820/http://www.ncimusic.com/tutorial/history/hiphop/hiphop.html |date=February 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History Of Hip Hop pg 8 [http://www.daveyd.com/raphist8.html Daveyd.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708234409/http://www.daveyd.com/raphist8.html |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest hip hop was mainly based on hard [[funk]] loops sourced from vintage funk records. However, by 1979, disco instrumental loops/tracks had become the basis of much hip hop music. This genre was called "disco rap". Ironically, the rise of hip hop music also played a role in the eventual decline in disco's popularity.

The disco sound had a strong influence on early hip hop music. Most of the early rap/hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar [[bass line]]s and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" as the foundation for their 1979 hit "[[Rapper's Delight]]", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world. In 1982, [[Afrika Bambaataa]] released the single "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]", which incorporated [[electronica]] elements from [[Kraftwerk]]'s "[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]" and "Numbers" as well as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|YMO]]'s "Riot in Lagos". The Planet Rock sound also spawned a [[hip-hop]] [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] trend, [[electro music]], which included songs such as [[Planet Patrol]]'s "Play at Your Own Risk" (1982), C Bank's "One More Shot" (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s "Club Underworld" (1984), [[Shannon (American singer)|Shannon]]'s "[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]" (1983), [[Freeez]]'s "I.O.U." (1983), [[Midnight Star (band)|Midnight Star]]'s "Freak-a-Zoid" (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s "[[I Feel For You]]" (1984).

DJ Pete Jones, Eddie Cheeba, [[DJ Hollywood]], and [[Love Bug Starski]] were disco-influenced hip hop DJs. Their styles differed from other hip hop musicians who focused on rapid-fire rhymes and more complex rhythmic schemes. [[Afrika Bambaataa]], Paul Winley, [[Grandmaster Flash]], and [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]] were all members of third s latter group. In Washington, D.C. [[go-go]] emerged as a reaction against disco and eventually incorporated characteristics of hip hop during the early 1980s. The DJ-based genre of [[electronic music]] behaved similarly, eventually evolving into underground styles known as [[house music]] in Chicago and [[techno music|techno]] in Detroit.

===Diversification of styles===

[[File:DJ Jazzy Jeff.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|[[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], who is also a record producer, manipulating a [[phonograph|record turntable]] in England in 2005.]]
The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles.&lt;ref name="Benson, G. 2010"&gt;Benson, G. (2010).''Lonely Planet USA'', Lonely Planet&lt;/ref&gt; New York City became a veritable laboratory for the creation of new hip hop sounds. Early examples of the diversification process can be heard in tracks such as Grandmaster Flash's "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]" (1981), a single consisting entirely of sampled tracks&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, M,.(2000). ''The musical work: reality or invention?'', Liverpool University Press&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" (1982), and [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Nunk (song)|Nunk]]," (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Toop, David (2000). ''Rap Attack 3: African Rap to Global Hip Hop''. (Expanded Third Edition) London: Serpent's Tail, pp. 150–151 {{ISBN|1-85242-627-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which signified the fusion of hip hop music with [[electro music|electro]]. In addition, [[Rammellzee]] &amp; [[K-Rob]]'s "Beat Bop" (1983) was a 'slow jam' which had a [[dub music|dub]] influence with its use of [[reverb]] and [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]] as texture and playful sound effects. "[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]," by [[Warp 9]] (1983), (produced and written by [[Lotti Golden]] and Richard Scher) described as a "cornerstone of early 80s beatbox afrofuturism," by the UK paper, ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt; introduced social commentary from a sci-fi perspective. In the 1970s, hip hop music typically used samples from funk and later, from disco. The mid-1980s marked a paradigm shift in the development of hip hop, with the introduction of samples from rock music, as demonstrated in the albums ''[[King of Rock]]'' and ''[[Licensed to Ill]]''. Hip hop prior to this shift is characterized as [[old school hip hop]].

[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, a staple sound of hip hop]]
In 1980, the [[Roland Corporation]] launched the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]] Rhythm Composer. It was one of the earliest [[Programming (music)|programmable]] drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns. Though it was a commercial failure, over the course of the decade the 808 attracted a [[cult following]] among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/01/16/roland-tr-808-beginners-guide-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-introduction/|title=Everything you ever wanted to know about the Roland TR-808 but were afraid to ask|date=January 16, 2014|website=Fact|access-date=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ease of use,&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2016/12/_808_the_movie_is_a_must_watch_doc_for_music_nerds.html|title=808s and heart eyes|last=Hamilton|first=Jack|date=December 16, 2016|newspaper=Slate|access-date=January 16, 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|archive-date=January 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116042034/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2016/12/_808_the_movie_is_a_must_watch_doc_for_music_nerds.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, "booming" [[bass drum]].&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Norris|first=Chris|date=August 13, 2015|title=The 808 heard round the world|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-808-heard-round-the-world|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=January 16, 2017|archive-date=May 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200504122454/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-808-heard-round-the-world|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance, and hip hop genres, popularized by early hits such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and the [[Soulsonic Force]]'s "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/14/roland-launch-new-instruments-808-909-303|title=Roland launch new versions of the iconic 808, 909 and 303 instruments|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=February 14, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=January 16, 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=March 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313045609/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/14/roland-launch-new-instruments-808-909-303|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=Peter|title=A Beginner's Guide to Digital Video|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stvOCfhc_igC&amp;pg=PA18|page=18|year=2004|publisher=AVA Books|isbn=978-2-88479-037-6|access-date=May 20, 2011|archive-date=April 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423220529/https://books.google.com/books?id=stvOCfhc_igC&amp;pg=PA18|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the [[Fender Stratocaster]]'s influence on rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/roland-resurrects-808/|title=Early hip-hop's greatest drum machine just got resurrected|last=Baldwin|first=Roberto|date=February 14, 2014|newspaper=Wired|access-date=January 4, 2016|language=en-US|archive-date=June 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616053522/https://www.wired.com/2014/02/roland-resurrects-808/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2008/12/whats_an_808.html|title=What's an 808?|last=Richards|first=Chris|date=December 2, 2008|newspaper=Slate|access-date=January 16, 2016|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|archive-date=April 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406171339/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2008/12/whats_an_808.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marlon Williams aka Dj Marley Marl.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|DJ [[Marley Marl]].]]
Over time [[sampling (music)|sampling]] technology became more advanced. However, earlier producers such as [[Marley Marl]] used drum machines to construct their beats from small excerpts of other beats in [[synchronisation]], in his case, triggering three [[Korg]] sampling-delay units through a Roland 808. Later, [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] such as the [[E-mu SP-1200]] allowed not only more memory but more flexibility for creative production. This allowed the filtration and layering different hits, and with a possibility of re-sequencing them into a single piece. With the emergence of a new generation of samplers such as the AKAI S900 in the late 1980s, producers did not have to create complex, time-consuming tape loops. [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s first album was created with the help of large tape loops. The process of looping a break into a breakbeat now became more commonly done with a sampler, now doing the job which so far had been done manually by the DJs using turntables. In 1989, DJ Mark James, under the moniker "45 King", released "The 900 Number", a breakbeat track created by synchronizing samplers and vinyl records.&lt;ref name="Toop"/&gt;

[[File:Dj Grandmaster Flash-01-mika.jpg|thumb|[[Grandmaster Flash]] performing in 1999.]]
The lyrical content and other instrumental accompaniment of hip hop developed as well. The early lyrical styles in the 1970, which tended to be boasts and clichéd chants, were replaced with metaphorical lyrics exploring a wider range of subjects. As well, the lyrics were performed over more complex, multi-layered instrumental accompaniment. Artists such as [[Melle Mel]], [[Rakim]], [[Chuck D]], [[KRS-One]] and [[Warp 9]] revolutionized hip hop by transforming it into a more mature art form, with sophisticated arrangements, often featuring "gorgeous textures and multiple layers"&lt;ref&gt;Toop, David (2000). ''Rap Attack 3: African Rap To Global Hip Hop'' (Expanded Third Edition), London: Serpent's Tail, p. 151, {{ISBN|1-85242-627-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The influential single "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" (1982) by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] is widely considered to be the pioneering force for [[conscious rap]].

[[Independent record label]]s like [[Tommy Boy Entertainment|Tommy Boy]], [[Prism Records]] and [[Profile Records]] became successful in the early 1980s, releasing records at a furious pace in response to the demand generated by local radio stations and club DJs. Early 1980s electro music and rap were catalysts that sparked the hip hop movement, led by artists such as [[Cybotron (American band)|Cybotron]], [[Hashim]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Planet Patrol]], [[Newcleus]] and [[Warp 9]]. In the New York City recording scene, artists collaborated with producer/writers such as [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], [[John Robie]], [[Lotti Golden]] and Richard Scher, exchanging ideas that contributed to the development of hip hop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Lucy Allan, Oren Ambarchi, Matt Anker, [[Lindsay Barrett]], Marcus Boon, Carla Bozulich, Can, Brian Case, Philip Clark, Byron Coley, Richard Cook, Jack Cooke, Julian Cowley, Alan Cummings, Einsturzende Neubauten, Phil England, [[Kodwo Eshun]], Mark Fell, Edward Fox, Phil Freeman, Jason Gross, Alexander Hacke, Mike Hames, Andy Hamilton, Max Harrison, Richard Henderson, Tony Herrington, Ken Hollings, Simon Hopkins, David Ilic, David Keenan, Biba Kopf, Ulrich Krieger, Alan Licht, Eric Lumbleau, Lydia Lunch, Howard Mandel, Merzbow, Keith Moliné, Will Montgomery, Brian Morton, Joe Muggs, Alex Neilson, Andrew Nosnitsky, Kasper Opstrup, Ian Penman, Edwin Pouncey, Brian Priestley, Reinhold Friedl, Adrian Rew, Simon Reynolds, Sam Richards, Robin Rimbaud, Bruce Russell, Sarah Angliss, Irmin Schmidt, Peter Shapiro, Brian Shimkovitz, Mark Sinker, Mark E.

The 1981 songs "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and "[[Christmas Wrapping]]" by the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Waitresses]] were among the first pop songs to use rap. In 1982, [[Afrika Bambaataa]] introduced hip hop to an international audience with "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]."

Prior to the 1980s, hip hop music was largely confined within the context of the United States. However, during the 1980s, it began its spread and became a part of the music scene in dozens of countries. [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]] was the first DJ to introduce electro hip hop to UK club audiences in the early 1980s, opting for the dub or instrumental versions of [[Nunk]] by [[Warp 9]], Extra T's "ET Boogie," [[Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)]] by [[Man Parrish]], [[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]] and [[Dirty Talk (Klein + M.B.O. song)|Dirty Talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/electro_funk_what_did_it_all_mean_wilson.htm|title=Wilson, Greg, "Electro-Funk-What Did It All Mean" November 2002|publisher=Globaldarkness.com|access-date=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the decade, [[B-boying]] became the first aspect of hip hop culture to reach Japan, Australia and South Africa. In South Africa, the breakdance crew [[Black Noise (group)|Black Noise]] established the practice before beginning to rap later in the decade. Musician and presenter [[Sidney Duteil|Sidney]] became France's first black TV presenter with his show ''[[H.I.P. H.O.P.]]''&lt;ref&gt;MCM retrospective on Sidney: ''« on peut dire aujourd'hui que Sidney est le papa du ''hip-hop'' français. Concepteur de l'émission H.I.P. H.O.P. en 1984 (1ère émission rap au monde diffusée à l'époque le dimanche à 14h00 avant Starsky &amp; Hutch), ce Dj/rappeur/breakeur extravagant fait découvrir cette nouvelle tendance américaine aux Français, à peine remis de la vague disco, et crée des vocations (Joey Starr, Passi, Stomy Bugsy...) »'' [http://www.mcm.net/musique/cdenecoute/23728/ H.I.P H.O.P – L'émission Mythique de Sidney] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207060603/http://www.mcm.net/musique/cdenecoute/23728/|date=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which screened on TF1 during 1984, a first for the genre worldwide. Sidney is considered the father of French hip hop. [[Radio Nova (France)|Radio Nova]] helped launch other French hip hop stars including [[Dee Nasty]], whose 1984 album ''Paname City Rappin''' along with compilations Rapattitude 1 and 2 contributed to a general awareness of hip hop in France.

Hip hop has always kept a very close relationship with the Latino community in New York. [[DJ Disco Wiz]] and the [[Rock Steady Crew]] were among early innovators from [[Puerto Rico]], combining English and Spanish in their lyrics. [[The Mean Machine (rap group)|The Mean Machine]] recorded their first song under the label "Disco Dreams" in 1981, while [[Kid Frost]] from Los Angeles began his career in 1982. [[Cypress Hill]] was formed in 1988 in the suburb of South Gate outside Los Angeles when [[Senen Reyes]] (born in Havana) and his younger brother Ulpiano Sergio ([[Mellow Man Ace]]) moved from Cuba to South Gate with his family in 1971. They teamed up with DVX from Queens (New York), Lawrence Muggerud ([[DJ Muggs]]) and Louis Freese ([[B-Real]]), a Mexican/Cuban-American native of Los Angeles. After the departure of "Ace" to begin his solo career, the group adopted the name of [[Cypress Hill]] named after a street running through a neighborhood nearby in South Los Angeles.

Japanese hip hop is said to have begun when Hiroshi Fujiwara returned to Japan and started playing hip hop records in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thememagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=115|title=International Man of Mystery|work=Theme Magazine|date=January 8, 2010|access-date=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317122537/http://www.thememagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=115|archive-date=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese hip hop generally tends to be most directly influenced by old school hip hop, taking the era's catchy beats, dance culture, and overall fun and carefree nature and incorporating it into their music. Hip hop became one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan, and the line between it and pop music is frequently blurred.

==1983–1986: New school hip hop==
{{Main|New school hip hop}}
[[File:Run DMC (cropped).png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Run-DMC]], from left to right: [[Joseph Simmons|Joseph "Run" Simmons]], [[Jam Master Jay|Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell]], and [[Darryl McDaniels|Darryl "D.M.C." McDaniels]].]]
The new school of hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[LL Cool J]]. As with the hip hop preceding it (which subsequently became known as [[old school hip hop]]), the new school came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by [[drum machine]]-led minimalism, with influences from rock music, a hip hop "metal music for the 80s–a hard-edge ugly/beauty trance as desperate and stimulating as New York itself."&lt;ref&gt;name: Toop p.151&lt;/ref&gt; It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street [[b-boy]] attitude.

These elements contrasted sharply with much of the previous funk- and disco-influenced hip hop groups, whose music was often characterized by novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers, and "party rhymes" (not all artists prior to 1983–84 had these styles). New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and they produced more cohesive LP albums than their old school counterparts. By 1986, their releases began to establish the hip-hop album as a fixture of mainstream music. Hip hop music became commercially successful, as exemplified by the [[Beastie Boys]]' 1986 album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'', which was the first rap album to hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Stephen|url=https://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A34rp283c054a|title=Licensed to Ill|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310095952/http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg|archive-date=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gangsta rap is a [[subgenre]] of hip hop that reflects the violent lifestyles of inner-city American black youths.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/GangstaRap.htm|title=Gangsta Rap – What Is Gangsta Rap|publisher=Rap.about.com|date=October 31, 2009|access-date=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gangsta'' is a [[non-rhotic]] pronunciation of the word ''[[gangster]]''. The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as [[Schoolly D]] and [[Ice-T]], and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like [[N.W.A]]. In 1985 Schoolly D released "[[P.S.K. What Does It Mean?]]", which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song, which was followed by Ice-T's "[[6 in the Mornin']]" in 1986. After the national attention and controversy that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as the mainstreaming of [[G-funk]] in the mid-1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially-lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Some gangsta rappers were known for mixing the political and social commentary of [[political rap]] with the criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap.&lt;ref name=polrap&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamont|first1=Michele|title=The Cultural Territories of Race: Black and White Boundaries|date=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXyxrh-5angC&amp;q=%22political+rap%22&amp;pg=PA334|access-date=January 18, 2015|isbn=9780226468365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

N.W.A is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. Their lyrics were more violent, openly confrontational, and shocking than those of established rap acts, featuring incessant profanity and, controversially, use of the word "[[nigga]]". These lyrics were placed over rough, rock guitar-driven beats, contributing to the music's hard-edged feel. The first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A's ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. ''Straight Outta Compton'' would establish [[West Coast hip hop]] as a vital genre, and establish Los Angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. ''Straight Outta Compton'' sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song "[[Fuck tha Police]]" earned a letter from [[FBI]] Assistant Director, Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing [[police|law enforcement]]'s resentment of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ryan|last=Ritchie|title=Eazy to be hard|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527|work=Press Telegram|publisher=Los Angeles Newspaper group|date=February 28, 2007|access-date=January 26, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304170024/http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527|archive-date=March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rap, Rock, and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice.|last=Deflem|first=Mathieu|url=http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html|access-date=July 21, 2012|year=1993|archive-date=September 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907213505/http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy surrounded Ice-T's album ''[[Body Count (album)|Body Count]]'', in particular over its song "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]". The song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the [[National Rifle Association]] and various police advocacy groups.&lt;ref name="Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=COVER STORY : 'Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator.

Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips "...they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. [Actor] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] blew away dozens of cops as [[the Terminator]]. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that." In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of ''Cop Killer'' and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: "The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer."&lt;ref name="Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining"/&gt;

The subject matter inherent in gangsta rap more generally has caused controversy. The White House administrations of both [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] criticized the genre.&lt;ref name="rap, race, and censorship"/&gt; "The reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of American culture ...What started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in American politics. The problem here is that the White House and wanna-bes like Bill Clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos," Sister Souljah told ''The Times''.&lt;ref name="rap, race, and censorship"/&gt; Due to the influence of Ice-T and N.W.A, gangsta rap is often viewed as a primarily West Coast phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like Schoolly D and [[Boogie Down Productions]] in shaping the genre.

Who ever figured then that the music would even be around in 1990, much less produce attractions that would command as much pop attention as Public Enemy and [[N.W.A]]? "Rapper's Delight" was a novelty record that was considered by much of the pop community simply as a lightweight offshoot of disco—and that image stuck for years. Occasional records—including [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|Grandmaster Flash]]'s "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" in 1982 and [[Run–D.M.C.|Run-DMC]]'s "[[It's like That (Run–D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]" in 1984—won critical approval, but rap, mostly, was dismissed as a passing fancy—too repetitious, too one dimensional. Yet rap didn't go away, and an explosion of energy and imagination in the late 1980s leaves rap today as arguably the most vital new street-oriented sound in pop since the birth of rock in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Hilburn020490"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Hilburn|date=February 4, 1990|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-04/entertainment/ca-470_1_public-enemy|title=Rap—The Power and the Controversy : Success has validated pop's most volatile form, but its future impact could be shaped by the continuing Public Enemy uproar|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles Times|access-date=June 7, 2012|archive-date=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206021209/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-04/entertainment/ca-470_1_public-enemy|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Record labels based out of [[Atlanta]], [[St. Louis]], and [[New Orleans]] also gained fame for their local scenes. The [[midwest rap]] scene was also notable, with the fast vocal styles from artists such as [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], [[Tech N9ne]], and [[Twista]]. By the end of the decade, hip hop was an integral part of popular music, and many American pop songs had hip hop components.

The East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry was a feud from 1991 to 1997 between artists and fans of the [[East Coast hip hop]] and [[West Coast hip hop]] scenes in the United States, especially from 1994 to 1997. Focal points of the feud were East Coast-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (and his New York-based label, [[Bad Boy Records]]) and West Coast-based rapper [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac Shakur, (and his Los Angeles-based label)]], [[Death Row Records]]).This rivalry started before the rappers themselves hit the scene. Because New York is the birthplace of hip-hop, artists from the West Coast felt as if they were not receiving the same media coverage and public attention as the East Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Giannotta|first=Meghan|title=East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry: A look at Tupac and Biggie's infamous hip-hop feud|url=https://www.amny.com/entertainment/east-coast-vs-west-coast-rivalry-a-look-at-tupac-and-biggie-s-infamous-hip-hop-feud-1-13742586/|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=amNewYork|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on both rappers began to grow in fame and as they both became more known the tensions continued to arise. Eventually both artists were fatally shot following drive-by shootings by unknown assailants in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

====East Coast hip hop====
{{Main|East Coast hip hop}}
[[File:Wu-Tang Clan - Virgin Festival.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Wu-Tang Clan]] at the Virgin Festival in 2007.]]
In the early 1990s East Coast hip hop was dominated by the [[Native Tongues]] posse, which was loosely composed of [[De La Soul]] with producer [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], the [[Jungle Brothers]], as well as their loose affiliates [[3rd Bass]], [[Main Source]], and the less successful [[Black Sheep (hip hop group)|Black Sheep]] and [[KMD]]. Although originally a "daisy age" conception stressing the positive aspects of life, darker material (such as De La Soul's thought-provoking "Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa") soon crept in. Artists such as [[Masta Ace]] (particularly for ''[[SlaughtaHouse]]''), [[Brand Nubian]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Organized Konfusion]], and [[Tragedy Khadafi]] had a more overtly-militant pose, both in sound and manner. In 1993, the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' revitalized the New York hip hop scene by pioneering an East Coast [[hardcore rap]] equivalent in intensity to what was being produced on the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/hardcore-rap-d2918|title=Hardcore Rap : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Allmusic, the production on two [[Mobb Deep]] albums, ''[[The Infamous]]'' (1995) and ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'' (1996), are "indebted" to [[RZA]]'s early production with the Wu-Tang Clan.&lt;ref name="Theinfamous"&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r212044|pure_url=yes}} | title = The Infamous at Allmusic | access-date = January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellonearth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r244016|pure_url=yes}} | title = Hell on Earth at Allmusic | access-date = January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of albums such as [[Nas]]'s ''[[Illmatic]]'' and [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s ''[[Ready to Die]]'' in 1994 cemented the status of the East Coast during a time of West Coast dominance. In a March 2002 issue of ''[[The Source Magazine]]'', [[Nas]] referred to 1994 as "a renaissance of New York [City] Hip-Hop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Osorio|first=Kim|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0PI5KpMxHD7WG9uQ19nem9UeE0|title=1994: The (Second) Most Important Year In Hip Hop|magazine=The Source|access-date=April 15, 2014|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220230630/https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0PI5KpMxHD7WG9uQ19nem9UeE0/edit|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions of RZA, particularly for the Wu-Tang Clan, became influential with artists such as Mobb Deep due to the combination of somewhat detached instrumental loops, highly compressed and processed drums, and [[gangsta rap|gangsta]] lyrical content. Wu-Tang solo albums such as [[Raekwon the Chef]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx]]'', [[Ghostface Killah]]'s ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'', and [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]'' are now viewed as classics along with Wu-Tang "core" material. The clan's base extended into further groups called "Wu-affiliates". Producers such as [[DJ Premier]] (primarily for [[Gang Starr]] but also for other affiliated artists, such as [[Jeru the Damaja]]), [[Pete Rock]] (with [[CL Smooth]], and supplying beats for many others), [[Buckwild]], [[Large Professor]], [[Diamond D]], and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] supplied beats for numerous MCs at the time, regardless of location. Albums such as Nas's ''Illmatic'', [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]]'s ''[[Word...Life]]'' (1994), and [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1996) are made up of beats from this pool of producers.

The rivalry between the East Coast and the West Coast rappers eventually turned personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/2a.html|title=The Murders of gangsta rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. - Crime Library on truTV.com|publisher=Trutv.com|date=November 30, 1994|access-date=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601200218/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/2a.html|archive-date=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the decade the business acumen of the [[Bad Boy Records]] tested itself against [[Jay-Z]] and his [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] and, on the West Coast, [[Death Row Records]]. The mid to late 1990s saw a generation of rappers such as the members of [[D.I.T.C.]] such as the late [[Big L]] and [[Big Pun]]. On the East Coast, although the "big business" end of the market dominated matters commercially the late 1990s to early 2000s saw a number of relatively successful East Coast indie labels such as [[Rawkus Records]] (with whom [[Mos Def]] and Talib Kweli garnered success) and later [[Def Jux]]. The history of the two labels is intertwined, the latter having been started by [[EL-P]] of [[Company Flow]] in reaction to the former, and offered an outlet for more underground artists such as [[Mike Ladd]], [[Aesop Rock]], [[Mr Lif]], [[RJD2]], [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]] and [[Cannibal Ox]]. Other acts such as the Hispanic [[Arsonists (rap group)|Arsonists]] and [[slam poet]] turned MC [[Saul Williams]] met with differing degrees of success.

[[File:Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Dr. Dre]] performing with [[Snoop Dogg]], 2012]]
After [[N.W.A.]] broke up, former member [[Dr. Dre]] released ''[[The Chronic]]'' in 1992, which peaked at No. 1 on the R&amp;B/hip hop chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r70573|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Chronic &gt; Charts &amp; Awards &gt; Billboard Albums |publisher=AllMusic |date=December 15, 1992 |access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; No. 3 on the pop chart, and spawned a No. 2 pop single with "[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]". ''The Chronic'' took West Coast rap in a new direction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Havelock|last=Nelson|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/111976/review/18944957/thechronic|title=The Chronic : Dr. Dre : Review|work=Rolling Stone|date=March 18, 1993|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced strongly by [[P funk]] artists, melding smooth and easy funk beats with slowly-drawled lyrics. This came to be known as [[G-funk]] and dominated mainstream hip hop in the early-mid 1990s through a roster of artists on [[Suge Knight]]'s [[Death Row Records]], including [[Tupac Shakur]], whose double disc album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' was a big hit with hit songs "[[Ambitionz az a Ridah]]" and "[[2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted]]";{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]], whose ''[[Doggystyle]]'' included the top ten hits "[[What's My Name? (Snoop Doggy Dogg song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Gin and Juice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=snoop dogg|bio=true}} |title=Snoop Dogg Music News &amp; Info &amp;#124; |work=Billboard |access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Los Angeles-based Death Row built an empire around Dre, Snoop, and Tupac, it also entered into [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|a rivalry]] with New York City's [[Bad Boy Records]], led by [[Puff Daddy]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]].

Detached from this scene were other artists such as [[Freestyle Fellowship]] and [[The Pharcyde]], as well as more underground artists such as the [[Solesides]] collective ([[DJ Shadow]] and [[Blackalicious]] amongst others), [[Jurassic 5]], [[Ugly Duckling (hip hop group)|Ugly Duckling]], [[People Under The Stairs]], [[Tha Alkaholiks]], and earlier [[Souls of Mischief]], who represented a return to hip hop's roots of sampling and well-planned rhyme schemes.

[[Atlanta hip hop]] artists were key in further expanding rap music and bringing southern hip hop into the mainstream. Releases such as [[Arrested Development (hip hop group)|Arrested Development]]'s ''[[3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of...]]'' in 1992, [[Goodie Mob]]'s ''[[Soul Food (Goodie Mob album)|Soul Food]]'' in 1995 and [[OutKast]]'s ''[[ATLiens]]'' in 1996 were all critically acclaimed. Other distinctive regional sounds from [[St. Louis]], Chicago, Washington D.C., Detroit and others began to gain popularity.

During the golden age, elements of hip hop continued to be assimilated into other genres of popular music.

In Hawaii, bands such as [[Sudden Rush]] combined hip hop elements with the local [[Hawaiian language|language]] and [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|political issues]] to form a style called [[na mele paleoleo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akindes|first=Fay Yokomizo|title=Sudden Rush: 'Na Mele Paleoleo' (Hawaiian Rap) as Liberatory Discourse|journal=Discourse|volume=23|number=1|year=2001|pages=82–98|doi=10.1353/dis.2001.0001|jstor=41389595|s2cid=143489394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s, in the wake of the deaths of [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], a new commercial sound emerged in the hip hop scene, sometimes referred to as the "bling era"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativecontrolmag.com/bling-era-playlist/|title=Bling Era Playlist &amp;#124; Creative Control|date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603035216/http://creativecontrolmag.com/bling-era-playlist/|access-date=February 25, 2021|archive-date=June 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (derived from [[Lil Wayne]]'s "[[Bling Bling (song)|Bling Bling]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/01/11/bling-bling-oral-history-lil-wayne-bg-turk-juvenile-birdman-mannie-fresh|title=The Complete History Of "Bling Bling" &amp;#124; The FADER|date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603035212/https://www.thefader.com/2017/01/11/bling-bling-oral-history-lil-wayne-bg-turk-juvenile-birdman-mannie-fresh|access-date=February 25, 2021|archive-date=June 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; "jiggy era"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revolutionarybutclubbing.blogspot.com/2008/02/jiggy-era.html|title=Revolutionary But Clubbing: Jiggy Era|date=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Festivalpeak"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://festivalpeak.com/independent-as-fuck-20-essential-underground-hip-hop-releases-from-1997-db1c5206a99e|title=Independent As Fuck: 20 Essential Underground Hip Hop Releases From 1997|date=November 3, 2017|website=Festivalpeak.com|access-date=February 25, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; (derived from [[Will Smith]]'s "[[Gettin' Jiggy wit It]]"), or "shiny suit era" (derived by metallic suits worn by some rappers in music videos at the time, such as in "[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]" by The Notorious B.I.G., [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], and [[Mase]]).&lt;ref name="ComplexShiny"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2012/09/the-best-shiny-suits-of-the-shiny-suit-era/|title=The Best Shiny Suits of the Shiny Suit Era &amp;#124; Complex|date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603035214/https://www.complex.com/style/2012/09/the-best-shiny-suits-of-the-shiny-suit-era/|access-date=February 25, 2021|archive-date=June 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the late 1990s, gangsta rap, while a huge-selling genre, had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream, committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not "selling out" to the pop charts. However, the rise of Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs's [[Bad Boy Records]], propelled by the massive crossover success of Combs's 1997 ensemble album ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap (and mainstream hip hop in general), as it would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted. Silky [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]]-styled hooks and production, more materialist subject matter, and samples of hit [[soul music|soul]] and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound, which was showcased by producers such as Combs, [[Timbaland]], [[The Trackmasters]], [[The Neptunes]], and [[Scott Storch]]. Also achieving similar levels of success at this time were [[Master P]] and his [[No Limit Records|No Limit]] label in [[New Orleans]]; Master P built up a roster of artists (the No Limit posse) based out of New Orleans, and incorporated [[G funk]] and [[Miami bass]] influences in his music. The New Orleans upstart [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]] label was also gaining popularity during this time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/soulja-boy-rockstar-new-mixtape.116492.html?song-111643 |title=Rockstar Souljah Boy mixtape |last=Lilah |first=Rose |date=August 1, 2016 |website=Hotnewhiphop |access-date=August 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816140032/http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/soulja-boy-rockstar-new-mixtape.116492.html?song-111643 |archive-date=August 16, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; with emerging artists such as [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G]], and [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]].

[[File:Eminem-01-mika.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|[[Eminem]] performing in [[Munich]], Germany in 1999.]]
Many of the rappers who achieved mainstream success at this time, such as [[Nelly]], Puff Daddy, [[Jay-Z]], the later career of [[Fat Joe]] and his [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]], [[Mase]], [[Ja Rule]], [[Fabolous]], and [[Cam'ron]], had a [[pop-rap|pop]]-oriented style, while others such as [[Big Pun]], [[Fat Joe]] (in his earlier career), [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Eminem]], [[50 Cent]] and his [[G-Unit]], and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] enjoyed commercial success at this time with a grittier style. Although white rappers like the [[Beastie Boys]], [[House of Pain]], and [[3rd Bass]] previously had some popular success or critical acceptance from the hip hop community, Eminem's success, beginning in 1999 with the platinum ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r397821|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Slim Shady LP &gt; Charts &amp; Awards &gt; Billboard Albums |publisher=AllMusic |date=February 23, 1999 |access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; surprised many. Hip hop influences also found their way increasingly into mainstream pop during this period, particularly in genres such as R&amp;B (e.g. [[R. Kelly]], [[Akon]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Beyonce]], [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]], [[Aliyah]], [[Usher (musician)|Usher]]), [[neo soul]] (e.g. [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Jill Scott]]), and [[nu metal]] (e.g. [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]]).

[[File:50 Cent 2012.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|[[50 Cent]] performing in 2012.]]
Dr. Dre remained an important figure in this era, making his comeback in 1999 with the album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]''. In 2000, he produced ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' by [[Eminem]], and also produced [[50 Cent]]'s 2003 album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin'&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. Billboard 200]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=50-cent|chart=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay-Z represented the cultural triumph of hip hop in this era. As his career progressed, he went from performing artist to entrepreneur, label president, head of a clothing line, club owner, and market consultant—along the way breaking [[Elvis Presley]]'s record for most number one albums on the ''Billboard'' magazine charts by a solo artist.

===Rise of alternative hip hop===
[[Alternative hip hop]], which was introduced in the 1980s and then declined, resurged in the early-mid 2000s with the rejuvenated interest in [[indie music]] by the general public. The genre began to attain a place in the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists such as [[OutKast]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]].&lt;ref name="Michel"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Michel|first=Sia|title=Critics' Choice: New CD's|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DF1031F93BA2575AC0A9609C8B63|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 18, 2006|access-date=May 10, 2008|archive-date=September 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907055552/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DF1031F93BA2575AC0A9609C8B63|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; OutKast's 2003 album ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' received high acclaim from music critics, and appealed to a wide range of listeners, being that it spanned numerous musical genres – including rap, rock, R&amp;B, punk, jazz, indie, country, pop, electronica, and gospel. The album also spawned two number-one hit singles, and has been [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[Music recording sales certification|diamond]] by selling 11 times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for shipping more than 11&amp;nbsp;million units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum&amp;nbsp;– Diamond Awards|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516220738/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/diamond.asp|archive-date=May 16, 2007|url=https://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/diamond.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the best selling hip-hop albums of all-time. It also won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]], being only the second rap album to do so. Previously, alternative hip hop acts had attained much critical acclaim, but received relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets; during this time, alternative hip hop artists such as [[MF Doom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mf-doom-mn0000220563|title=MF Doom Biography by Dan LeRoy|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|last=LeRoy|first=Dan|access-date=January 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316100239/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mf-doom-mn0000220563|archive-date=March 16, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Roots]], [[Dilated Peoples]], Gnarls Barkley, [[Mos Def]], and [[Aesop Rock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1078358|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, [https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049521/high-school-musical-2-starts-third-week-at-no-1 "'High School Musical 2' Starts Third Week At No. 1"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113080733/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049521/high-school-musical-2-starts-third-week-at-no-1 |date=January 13, 2020 }}, ''Billboard'', September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; began to achieve significant recognition.

===Glitch hop and wonky music===
{{Main|Glitch hop|Wonky (music)}}
[[File:The Glitch Mob Live.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|[[The Glitch Mob]] performing in the [[Netherlands]] in 2010]]
Glitch hop and wonky music evolved following the rise of [[trip hop]], [[dubstep]] and [[intelligent dance music]] (IDM). Both glitch hop and wonky music frequently reflect the experimental nature of IDM and the heavy bass featured in dubstep songs. While trip hop has been described as being a distinct British upper-middle class take on hip-hop, glitch-hop and wonky music have much more stylistic diversity. Both genres are [[melting pot]]s of influence. Glitch hop contains echoes of 1980s pop music, Indian [[raga]]s, eclectic [[jazz]] and [[West Coast rap]]. Los Angeles, London, [[Glasgow]] and a number of other cities have become hot spots for these scenes, and underground scenes have developed across the world in smaller communities. Both genres often pay homage to older and more well established [[electronic music]] artists such as [[Radiohead]], [[Aphex Twin]] and [[Boards of Canada]] as well as independent hip hop producers like [[J Dilla]] and [[Madlib]].

Glitch hop is a fusion genre of hip hop and glitch music that originated in the early to mid-2000s in the United States and Europe. Musically, it is based on irregular, chaotic [[breakbeat]]s, glitchy [[bassline]]s and other typical sound effects used in glitch music, like skips. Glitch hop artists include [[Prefuse 73]], [[Dabrye]] and [[Flying Lotus]]. Wonky is a subgenre of hip hop that originated around 2008, but most notably in the United States and United Kingdom, and among international artists of the [[Hyperdub]] music label, under the influence of glitch hop and dubstep. Wonky music is of the same glitchy style as glitch hop, but it was specifically noted for its melodies, rich with "mid-range unstable synths". Scotland has become one of the most prominent wonky scenes, with artists like [[Hudson Mohawke]] and [[Rustie]].

Glitch hop and wonky are popular among a relatively smaller audience interested in alternative hip hop and [[electronic music]] (especially dubstep); neither glitch hop nor wonky have achieved mainstream popularity. However, artists like [[Flying Lotus]], [[The Glitch Mob]] and [[Hudson Mohawke]] have seen success in other avenues. Flying Lotus's music has earned multiple positive reviews on the independent music review site [[Pitchfork.com]] as well as a prominent (yet uncredited) spot during [[Adult Swim]] commercial breaks. Hudson Mohawke is one of few glitch hop artists to play at major music festivals such as [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]].

===Crunk music===
{{Main|Crunk}}
[[File:lil Jon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Producer [[Lil Jon]] is one of crunk's most prominent figures.]]
Crunk is a regional hip hop genre that originated in [[Tennessee]] in the southern United States in the 1990s, influenced by [[Miami bass]]. One of the pioneers of crunk, [[Lil Jon]], said that it was a fusion of hip hop, [[electro (music)|electro]], and [[electronic dance music]]. The style was pioneered and commercialized by artists from [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Atlanta]], Georgia, gaining considerable popularity in the mid-2000s via Lil Jon and the [[Ying Yang Twins]]. Looped, stripped-down [[drum machine]] rhythms are usually used. The [[Roland TR-808]] and [[Roland TR-909|909]] are among the most popular. The drum machine loops are usually accompanied by simple, repeated synthesizer melodies and heavy bass "stabs". The tempo of the music is somewhat slower than hip-hop, around the speed of [[reggaeton]]. The focal point of crunk is more often the beats and instrumental music rather than the lyrics. Crunk rappers, however, often shout and scream their lyrics, creating an aggressive, almost heavy, style of hip-hop. While other subgenres of hip-hop address sociopolitical or personal concerns, crunk is almost exclusively "party music", favoring call and response hip-hop slogans in lieu of more substantive approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernspaces.org/2008/dirty-decade-rap-music-and-us-south-1997-2007|first=Matt|last=Miller|title=Dirty Decade: Rap Music from the South: 1997–2007|publisher=Southernspaces.org|date=June 10, 2008|access-date=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918045732/http://www.southernspaces.org/2008/dirty-decade-rap-music-and-us-south-1997-2007|archive-date=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crunk helped southern hip hop gain mainstream prominence during this period, as the classic East and West Coast styles of the 1990s gradually lost power.

===Snap music and influence of the Internet===
{{Main|Snap music}}
[[File:Soulja.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Soulja Boy in an interview with [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] at [[E3 2018]].]]
Snap rap (also known as ringtone rap) is a subgenre of crunk that emerged from [[Atlanta]], Georgia in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Vibe Jun 2006, Oh Snap!"&gt;''Vibe'', June 2006, "Oh Snap!"&lt;/ref&gt; The genre gained mainstream popularity in the mid-late 2000s, and artists from other Southern states such as [[Tennessee]] also began to emerge performing in this style. Tracks commonly consist of a [[Roland TR-808]] [[bass drum]], [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]], [[bass (instrument)|bass]], finger [[snap (fingers)|snapping]], a main [[groove (music)|groove]], and a simplistic vocal [[hook (music)|hook]]. Hit snap songs include "[[Lean wit It, Rock wit It]]" by [[Dem Franchize Boyz]], "[[Laffy Taffy (song)|Laffy Taffy]]" by [[D4L]], "[[It's Goin' Down (Yung Joc song)|It's Goin' Down]]" by [[Yung Joc]], and "[[Crank That (Soulja Boy)]]" by [[Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]]. In retrospect, Soulja Boy has been credited with setting trends in hip hop, such as self-publishing his songs through the Internet (which helped them go [[Viral video|viral]]) and paving the way for a new wave of younger artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/music/2019/01/23/soulja-boy-opinion.html|title=5 Reasons Soulja Boy Is The Most Influential Rapper Of His Generation|date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603021958/https://www.bet.com/music/2019/01/23/soulja-boy-opinion.html|access-date=February 25, 2021|archive-date=June 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://djbooth.net/features/2016-03-24-soulja-boy-myspace-internet| title=How Soulja Boy &amp; Myspace Brought Hip-Hop into the Internet Era |website=Djbooth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline in sales===
[[File:Flo Rida (6924266548).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|While hip hop music sales dropped a great deal in the mid-late 2000s, rappers like [[Flo Rida]] were successful online and with singles, despite low album sales.]]
Starting in 2005, sales of hip hop music in the United States began to severely wane, leading ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to question if mainstream hip-hop was "dying." ''Billboard'' magazine found that, since 2000, rap sales dropped 44%, and declined to 10% of all music sales, which, while still a commanding figure when compared to other genres, is a significant drop from the 13% of all music sales where rap music regularly placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremusic.com/news/april2007/musictrends-hiphop.html|title=After 21% Decline In Sales, Rap Industry Takes A Hard Look At Itself|publisher=Futuremusic.com|date=April 9, 2006|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ta-Nehisi Coates Friday, August 17, 2007|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1653639,00.html|title=Hip-Hop's Down Beat|date=August 17, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2010|journal=Time|archive-date=April 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414043615/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1653639,00.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Courtland Milloy]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', for the first time on five years, no rap albums were among the top 10 sellers in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Milloy, Courtland.

The Washington Post, September 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]] culture critic Elizabeth Blair noted that, "some industry experts say young people are fed up with the violence, degrading imagery and lyrics." However, the 2005 report ''Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year-Olds'' found that hip hop music is by far the most popular music genre for children and teenagers with 65 percent of 8- to-18-year-olds listening to it on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rideout|first1=Victoria|first2=Donald F.|last2=Roberts|first3=Ulla F.|last3=Foehr|url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Executive-Summary-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf|access-date=May 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307122252/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Executive-Summary-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf|archive-date=March 7, 2006|title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year-Olds|year=2005|issue=March|location=Menlo Park, CA|journal=[[Kaiser Family Foundation|The Henry J.

Other journalists say the music is just as popular as it ever was, but that fans have found other means to consume the music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7834732|title=Is Hip-Hop Dying Or Has It Moved Underground?|publisher=National Public Radio – All Things Considered|first=Elizabeth|last=Blair|date=March 11, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as illegally downloading music through P2P networks, instead of purchasing albums and singles from legitimate stores. For example, [[Flo Rida]] is known for his low album sales regardless of his singles being mainstream and having digital success. His second album ''[[R.O.O.T.S.]]'' sold only 200,000+ total units in the U.S., which could not line up to the sales of the album's lead single "[[Right Round]]". This also happened to him in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/04/better-as-a-song-or-a-ring-tone.html|title=Better as a song or a ring tone|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Todd|last=Martens|access-date=April 30, 2009|date=April 30, 2009|archive-date=February 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206221407/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/04/better-as-a-song-or-a-ring-tone.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some put the blame on hip hop becoming less lyrical over time, such as Soulja Boy's 2007 debut album ''[[souljaboytellem.com]]'' which was met with negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/soulja-boy-tell-em-souljaboytellemcom-1002072/|title=Soulja Boy Tell 'Em – Souljaboytellem.com – Hip Hop Album Review|publisher=Djbooth.net|access-date=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209084323/http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/soulja-boy-tell-em-souljaboytellemcom-1002072/|archive-date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of sampling, a key element of early hip hop, has also been noted for the decrease in quality of modern albums. For example, there are only four samples used in 2008's ''[[Paper Trail]]'' by [[T.I.]], while there are 35 samples in 1998's ''[[Moment of Truth (Gang Starr album)|Moment of Truth]]'' by [[Gang Starr]]. The decrease in sampling is in part due to it being too expensive for producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://matthewnewton.us/node/775|title=Is Sampling Dead? &amp;#124; by Matthew Newton|publisher=Matthew Newton|first=Matthew|last=Newton|date=December 1, 2008|access-date=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925055433/http://matthewnewton.us/node/775|archive-date=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyewestdec2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kanye West]] performing in 2008]]
By the late 2000s, alternative hip hop had secured its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap. Industry observers view the [[Graduation (album)#Sales|sales race]] between Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' and [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' as a turning point for hip hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sexton, Paul|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049223/kanye-defeats-50-cent-on-uk-album-chart|title=Kanye Defeats 50 Cent On U.K. Album Chart|work=Billboard|date=September 17, 2007|access-date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he designed it as a melancholic pop album rather than a rap album, Kanye's following ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album was predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Common Praises Kanye's Singing; Lupe Fiasco Plays CEO: Mixtape Monday|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596254/20081003/common.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=October 3, 2008|access-date=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Urban Review: Kanye West, ''808s and Heartbreak''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/kanye-west-hip-hop-808s-heartbreak|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd|date=November 9, 2008|access-date=November 24, 2008|location=London|archive-date=December 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201103614/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/09/kanye-west-hip-hop-808s-heartbreak|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the release of ''[[The Blueprint 3]]'', New York rap mogul [[Jay-Z]] revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, "... it's not gonna be a #1 album.

Due in part to the increasing use of music distribution through social media and blogging, many alternative and non-alternative rappers found acceptance by far-reaching audiences, hence why this era of hip hop is sometimes termed the "blog era".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trapital.co/2020/05/28/why-hip-hop-fans-miss-the-blog-era/|title=Why Hip-Hop Fans Miss the Blog Era - Trapital by Dan Runcie|date=September 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919225511/https://trapital.co/2020/05/28/why-hip-hop-fans-miss-the-blog-era/|access-date=February 25, 2021|archive-date=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/where-are-they-now-20-icons-of-the-hip-hop-blog-era-news.82448.html|title=Where Are They Now? 20 Icons Of The "Hip Hop Blog" Era|date=April 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429034125/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/where-are-they-now-20-icons-of-the-hip-hop-blog-era-news.82448.html|access-date=February 25, 2021|archive-date=April 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several artists, such as [[Kid Cudi]] and [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], managed to attain chart-topping hit songs, "[[Day 'n' Nite]]" and "[[Best I Ever Had (Drake song)|Best I Ever Had]]" respectively, by releasing their music on free online [[mixtape]]s without the help of a major record label.

Other artists not within the hip hop genre have also experimented with trap, such as "[[7/11 (song)|7/11]]" by [[Beyoncé]] and "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]" by [[Katy Perry]] featuring [[Juicy J]].

Major artists to arise from the genre in the 2010s include [[Waka Flocka Flame]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Chief Keef]], [[Migos]], [[Young Thug]], [[Travis Scott]], [[Kodak Black]], [[21 Savage]], [[Yung Lean]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], [[Juice Wrld]], [[Trippie Redd]], [[Lil Pump]], [[Smokepurpp]], [[Rae Sremmurd]], [[Tekashi 6ix9ine]], [[NBA YoungBoy]], [[Lil Baby]], [[Fetty Wap]], among others. Female rappers [[Cardi B]] and [[Megan Thee Stallion]] also entered the mainstream. Trap artists that originated in the 2000s were able to recapture mainstream success in the 2010s with the rise of trap, including [[2 Chainz]], [[Gucci Mane]] and [[Juicy J]], becoming more successful in the latter part of their career than when they debuted. Trap producers to reach mainstream success include [[Metro Boomin]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], [[London on da Track]], and [[Mike WiLL Made-It]].

Critics of the trap genre have used the term "[[mumble rap]]" to describe the heavily auto-tuned, and sometimes hard to understand, delivery of verses from a majority of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mumble Rap: cultural laziness or a true reflection of contemporary times?|url=http://theconversation.com/mumble-rap-cultural-laziness-or-a-true-reflection-of-contemporary-times-85550|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists longstanding within the genre have had their own comments regarding the rise of mumble rap, such as [[Rick Rubin]] stating that Eminem was confused by it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rick Rubin Says Eminem Is Frustrated With 'Mumble Rap'|date=November 11, 2017|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8031293/eminem-rick-rubin-mumble-rap-broken-record-podcast|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snoop Dogg claiming that he can't differentiate between artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg says new generation of rappers sound identical|date=May 15, 2015|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/snoop-dogg-31-1218611|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Thought]], lead rapper from [[The Roots]], stated that the "game has changed.

The online audio distribution platform [[SoundCloud]] played a massive role in the creation of various artists' careers in the latter half of the 2010s. Mainstream acts to start on SoundCloud include [[Post Malone]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Russ (rapper)|Russ]], [[Bryson Tiller]], [[Lil Xan]], [[Lil Pump]], [[Lil Peep]], [[Lil Skies]], [[Smokepurpp]], [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[Trippie Redd]], [[Playboi Carti]], [[YBN Nahmir]], [[Tay-K]], [[ZillaKami]], [[Ugly God]], [[Nav (rapper)|NAV]] among others. These songs are usually closely related to trap, but have also been labeled separately as [[SoundCloud rap]]. They have been characterized as usually having moody, sad undertones, and usually feature lo-fi rough production.

=== Female hip hop artists ===
In today's society hip-hop or even rap, recognizes mostly male artists. Often times the female artists are overlooked. There are many women that have notably influenced the hip-hop culture. But a few names that cannot go unsaid are MC Sha-rock, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliot, Lil Kim, Erykah Badu, Foxy Brown, Nicki Minaj and many more. Of this list MC Sha-rock is considered the historian/pioneer of female hip-hop culture. She started her career as a break-dancer in the Bronx, New York and later became "The hip-hop's culture's first female emcee/rapper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biography and History of MC Sha-Rock|url=http://mcsharockonline.com/Biography/biography.html|access-date=December 5, 2020|website=mcsharockonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career has been long-lived. From being a former member of the Funky 4+1 more to having MC rhyming battles with groups such as Grandmaster Flash and Furious 5. Another notable pioneer of female hip-hop is the famous Queen Latifah, Born Dana Elaine Owens in Newark,NJ. Queen Latifah started her career from a young age, as early as 17. But, not long after it began it soon took-off. She released her first full length album, ''All Hail the Queen'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pelton|first=Tristan Michael|title=Queen Latifah (1970– )|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/queen-latifah-1970/|access-date=December 5, 2020|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she continued to release music she grew more and more popular, and her fame increased amidst the hip-hop culture. However, Queen Latifah was not an ordinary rapper. She rapped about the issues surrounding being a black woman and overall social injustice issues that appear in the music industry. In 1993, she recorded an album called ''Black Reign'' that featured the song ''U.N.I.T.Y'' that confronted the anti-feminist rhetoric and domestic violence, which was prominent among male acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pelton|first=Tristan Michael|title=Queen Latifah (1970– )|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/queen-latifah-1970/|access-date=December 5, 2020|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passes, Queen Latifah has been recognized as a popular songwriter, actress, and producer. These early pioneers have led female rap culture and impacted today's popular female hip-hop artists. For example, such popular artists may include Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Miss Mulatto, Flo Milli, and many others. Each artists has their own identity in the rap game, however as hip-hop evolves so does the style of music.

==World hip hop music==
[[File:Pete Rock @ The Brookyln Bowl in 2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pete Rock]] performing at Razel and Friends – Brooklyn Bowl, 2016]]
Hip-hop music has reached the cultural corridors of the globe and has been absorbed and reinvented around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2004-12-09-where-youre-at_x.htm|title=The globalization of hip-hop starts and ends with 'Where You're At'|last=Nawotka|first=Edward|date=December 10, 2004|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop music expanded beyond the US, often blending local styles with hip hop. Hip hop has globalized into many cultures worldwide, as evident through the emergence of numerous regional scenes. It has emerged globally as a movement based upon the main tenets of hip hop culture. The music and the art continue to embrace, even celebrate, its transnational dimensions while staying true to the local cultures to which it is rooted. Hip-hop's impact differs depending on each culture. Still, the one thing virtually all hip hop artists worldwide have in common is that they acknowledge their debt to those African-American people in New York who launched the global movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/kelley-foreword-vinyl-aint-final.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latinos and people from the Caribbean played an integral role in the early development of hip hop in New York, and the style spread to almost every country in that region. Hip hop first developed in the South Bronx, which had a high Latino, particularly Puerto Rican, population in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781403960443|title=New York Ricans from the hip hop zone|last=Rivera|first=Raquel Z.|date=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1403960445|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=51031024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous rappers from New York City of Puerto Rican origin are the late [[Big Pun]], [[Fat Joe]], and [[Angie Martinez]]. With Latino rap groups like [[Cypress Hill]] on the American charts, Mexican rap rock groups, such as [[Control Machete]], rose to prominence in their native land.

In many Latin American countries, as in the U.S., hip hop has been a tool with which marginalized people can articulate their struggle. Hip hop grew steadily more popular in Cuba in the 1980s and 1990s through Cuba's [[Special Period]] that came with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negro soy yo : hip hop and raced citizenship in neoliberal Cuba|author=Perry, Marc D.|isbn=9780822358855|location=Durham|oclc=903675195|date = December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of economic crisis, which the country's poor and black populations especially hard, hip hop became a way for the country's Afro-descended population to embrace their blackness and articulate a demand for racial equality for black people in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negro soy yo : hip hop and raced citizenship in neoliberal Cuba|last=Perry|first=Marc D.|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780822358855|location=Durham|pages=78–80|oclc=903675195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of blackness and black liberation was not always compatible with the goals of the Cuban government, which was still operating under the idea that a raceless society was the correct realization of the Cuban Revolution. When hip-hop emerged, the Cuban government opposed the vulgar image that rappers portrayed, but later accepted that it might be better to have hip-hop under the influence of the Ministry of Culture as an authentic expression of Cuban Culture.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/22/hln.hot.hit.cuban.hip.hop/|title=CNN.com – Cuban hip-hop: The rebellion within the revolution – Nov. 25, 2002|date=November 22, 2002|access-date=February 24, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827064116/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/22/hln.hot.hit.cuban.hip.hop/|archive-date=August 27, 2009|url-status=dead|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappers who explicitly speak about race or racism in Cuba are still under scrutiny by the government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black in Latin America|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=9780814738184|location=New York|pages=219|oclc=692291843}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual Cuban hip hop concert, beginning in 1995, held at [[Alamar]] in [[Havana]] helped popularize Cuban hip hop. Famous Cuban rap groups include [[Krudas Cubensi]] and Supercrónica Obsesión.

Black and indigenous people in Latin America and Caribbean islands have been using hip hop for decades to discuss race and class issues in their respective countries. [[Brazilian hip hop]] is heavily associated with racial and economic issues in the country, where a lot of [[Afro-Brazilians]] live in economically disadvantaged communities, known in Brazil as [[favela]]s. [[São Paulo]] is where [[hip hop]] began in the country, but it soon spread all over Brazil, and today, almost every big Brazilian city, including [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Recife]] and [[Brasilia]], has a [[hip hop]] scene. Some notable artists include [[Racionais MC's]], Thaide, and [[Marcelo D2]]. One of Brazil's most popular rappers, [[MV Bill]], has spent his career advocating for black youth in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[Reggaeton]], a Puerto Rican style of music, has a lot of similarities with U.S.-based hip hop. Both were influenced by [[Jamaican music]], and both incorporate [[rapping]] and call and response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La verdad : an international dialogue on hip hop Latinidades|year=2016|isbn=9780814213155|location=Columbus|pages=84|oclc=945948404|last1 = Castillo-Garsow|first1 = Melissa|last2 = Planas|first2 = Melissa Castillo|last3 = Nichols|first3 = Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancehall music and hip from the United States are both popular music in Puerto Rico, and reggaeton is the cumulation of different musical traditions founded by Afro-descended people in the Caribbean and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La verdad : an international dialogue on hip hop Latinidades|year=2016|isbn=9780814213155|location=Columbus|pages=85|oclc=945948404|last1 = Castillo-Garsow|first1 = Melissa|last2 = Planas|first2 = Melissa Castillo|last3 = Nichols|first3 = Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of reggaeton's most popular artists include [[Don Omar]], [[Tego Calderón]], and [[Daddy Yankee]].

In Venezuela, social unrest at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s coincided with the rise of [[gangsta rap]] in the United States and led to the rise of that music in Venezuela as well. Venezuelan rappers in the 1990s generally modeled their music after gangsta rap, embracing and attempting to redefine negative stereotypes about poor and black youth as dangerous and materialistic and incorporating socially conscious critique of Venezuela's criminalization of young, poor, Afro-descended people into their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandes|first=Sujatha|year=2012|editor-last=Kwame Dixon|editor-first=John Burdick|title=Comparative Perspectives on Afro-Latin America|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/595928|language=en|pages=89|access-date=December 2, 2017|archive-date=December 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203013804/https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/595928|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haiti]], hip hop developed in the early 1980s. Master Dji and his songs "Vakans" and "Politik Pa m" are mostly credited with the rise of Haitian hip hop. What later became known as "Rap Kreyòl" grew in popularity in the late 1990s with King Posse and Original Rap Stuff. Due to cheaper recording technology and flows of equipment to Haiti, more Rap Kreyòl groups are recording songs, even after the January 12 earthquake. Haitian hip hop has recently become a way for artists of Haitian backgrounds in the Haiti and abroad to express their national identity and political opinions about their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La verdad : an international dialogue on hip hop Latinidades|year=2016|isbn=9780814213155|location=Columbus|pages=253|oclc=945948404|last1 = Castillo-Garsow|first1 = Melissa|last2 = Planas|first2 = Melissa Castillo|last3 = Nichols|first3 = Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rappers have embraced the red and blue of the [[Flag of Haiti]] and rapping in [[Haitian Creole]] to display their national origin. In the [[Dominican Republic]], a recording by Santi Y Sus Duendes and [[Lisa M]] became the first single of [[merenrap]], a fusion of hip hop and [[Merengue music|merengue]].

In Europe, Africa, and Asia, hip hop began to move from the underground to mainstream audiences. In Europe, hip hop was the domain of both ethnic nationals and immigrants. [[British hip hop]], for example, became a genre of its own and spawned artists such as [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[The Streets]] and many more. Germany produced the well-known [[Die Fantastischen Vier]] as well as several [[Turkish people|Turkish]] performers like the controversial [[Cartel (rap group)|Cartel]], [[Kool Savas|Kool Savaş]], and [[Azad (rapper)|Azad]]. Similarly, France has produced a number of native-born stars, such as [[IAM (band)|IAM]] and [[Suprême NTM]], [[MC Solaar]], [[Rohff]], [[Rim'K]] or [[Booba]]. In the Netherlands, important nineties rappers include The [[Osdorp Posse]], a crew from [[Amsterdam]], [[Extince]], from [[Oosterhout]], and [[Postmen]]. Italy found its own rappers, including [[Jovanotti]] and [[Articolo 31]], grow nationally renowned, while the Polish scene began in earnest early in the decade with the rise of [[PM Cool Lee]]. In [[Romania]], [[B.U.G. Mafia]] came out of [[Bucharest]]'s [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]] neighborhood, and their brand of gangsta rap underlines the parallels between life in Romania's Communist-era apartment blocks and in the housing projects of America's ghettos.

[[File:Blockfest 2017.jpg|thumb|left|The annual Blockfest in [[Tampere]], [[Finland]] is the largest hip hop music event in the [[Nordic countries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visittampere.fi/article/blockfest | title=Blockfest 2016 | work=Visit Tampere | publisher=Visit Tampere Matkailuneuvonta | access-date=2021-04-19 | language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also one of the best-selling festivals in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10858876|title=Hiphop-festivaali Blockfest myytiin loppuun ennätysajassa|work=[[YLE]]|access-date=2021-04-19|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picture of Blockfest in 2017.]]
One of the countries outside the US where hip-hop is most popular is the United Kingdom. [[Grime (music)|Grime]], a genre of music derived from [[UK Garage]] and [[drum and bass]] and influenced by hip hop, emerged in the early 2000s with artists such as [[Dizzee Rascal]] becoming successful. Although it is immensely popular, many British politicians criticize the music for what they see as promoting theft and murder, similar to gangsta rap in America. These criticisms have been deemed racist by the mostly [[Black British]] grime industry. Despite its controversial nature, grime has had a major effect on British fashion and pop music, with many young working-class youth emulating the clothing worn by grime stars like Dizzee Rascal and Wiley. There are many subgenres of grime, including "Rhythm and Grime," a mix of R&amp;B and grime, and [[grindie]], a mix of [[indie rock]] and grime popularized by indie rock band [[Hadouken!]]

In Germany and France, [[gangsta rap]] has become popular among youths who like the violent and aggressive lyrics. Some German rappers openly or comically flirt with Nazism; for example, [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]] (born Anis Mohamed Youssef Ferchichi) raps "Salutiert, steht stramm, Ich bin der Leader wie A" (Salute, stand to attention, I am the leader like 'A') and [[Fler]] had a hit with the record ''Neue Deutsche Welle'' (New German Wave) complete with the title written in Third Reich style Gothic print and advertised with an [[Adolf Hitler]] quote. These references also spawned great controversy in Germany. Meanwhile, in France, artists like [[Kery James]]' Idéal J maintained a radical, anti-authoritarian attitude and released songs like ''[[Le Combat Continue|Hardcore]]'' which attacked the growth of the French far right. In the Netherlands, MC [[Brainpower]] went from being an underground battle rapper to mainstream recognition in the [[Benelux]], thus influencing numerous rap artists in the region. In Israel, rapper [[Subliminal (rapper)|Subliminal]] reaches out to Israeli youth with political and religious-themed lyrics, usually with a [[Zionist]] message.

[[File:Fler 2011 by NicoJenner.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The German rapper [[Fler]] caused significant controversy with his music.]]
In Asia, mainstream stars rose to prominence in the [[Philippines]], led by [[Francis Magalona]], Rap Asia, MC Lara and Lady Diane. In Japan, where underground rappers had previously found a limited audience, and popular [[teen idol]]s brought a style called J-rap to the top of the charts in the middle of the 1990s. Of particular importance is the influence on East Asian nations, where hip hop music has become fused with local popular music to form different styles such as [[K-pop]], [[C-pop]] and [[J-pop]].

Israel's hip hop grew greatly in popularity at the end of the decade, with several stars both [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ([[Tamer Nafar]]) and [[Israeli people|Israeli]] ([[Subliminal (rapper)|Subliminal]]). In Portugal hip hop has his own kind of rapping, which is more political and underground scene, they are known for [[Valete]], [[Dealema]] and [[Halloween]]. [[Russian hip hop]] emerged during last years of [[Soviet Union]] and cemented later, with groups like [[Malchishnik]] and [[Bad Balance]] enjoying mainstream popularity in the 1990s, while [[Ligalize]] and [[Kasta]] were popular in the 2000s. In former [[Yugoslavia]] hip hop first appeared during the 1980s mostly with [[Serbian hip hop]] with performers such as [[B-boy]], [[The Master Scratch Band]], Badvajzer, and others. During the late 1990s hip hop had a boom, with [[Rambo Amadeus]] and later [[Beogradski sindikat]] becoming a major performer. [[Bosnian and Herzegovinian hip hop]] is nowadays dominated by [[Edo Maajka]]. In the region hip hop is often used as a political and social message in song themes such as war, profiteering, corruption, etc. [[Frenkie]], another Bosnian rapper, is associated with Edo Maajka, and has collaborated beyond Bosnian borders.

In [[Tanzania]] in the early 2000s, local hip hop artists became popular by infusing local styles of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Arabesque (Turkish music)|arabesque]] melodies, dancehall and hip-hop beats with Swahili lyrics.
