'''Afghanistan''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Afghanistan.ogg|æ|f|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n|ᵻ|s|t|æ|n|,_|æ|f|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|ᵻ|s|t|ɑː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;These pronunciations involve assimilation, wherein /f/ becomes its assimilated allophone [v] before a voiced consonant.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dari]]: {{lang|ps|افغانستان}}, Dari: {{lang|prs-Latn|Afġānestān}} {{IPA-fa|avɣɒnesˈtɒn|}}), officially the '''Islamic Republic of Afghanistan''', is a mountainous [[landlocked country]] at the crossroads of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. Afghanistan is bordered by [[Pakistan]] to the east and south, [[Iran]] to the west, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] to the north, and [[People's Republic of China|China]] to the northeast. Occupying {{convert|652000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest. [[Kabul]] is the capital and largest city. Its population is around 39&amp;nbsp;million, composed mostly of ethnic [[Pashtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]], and [[Uzbeks]].

Humans lived in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="JFS"/&gt; [[Neolithic|Settled life]] emerged in the region 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the [[Indus civilization]] ([[Shortugai]] site), the [[Oxus civilization]] (Dashlyji site), and the [[Helmand civilization]] ([[Mundigak]] site) of the 3rd millennium BCE.&lt;ref name="Combined-2"&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] migrated through [[Bactria]]-[[Margiana]] area to [[Gandhara]], followed by the rise of the [[Iron Age]] [[Yaz culture|Yaz I culture]] (ca. 1500–1100 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Anthony|first=David W.|title=The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0691058870|author-link=David W.

[[Alexander the Great]] invaded the region in the 4th century BCE, and married [[Roxana]] in Bactria before his [[Cophen campaign|Kabul Valley campaign]], where he faced resistance from [[Aspasioi]] and Assakan tribes. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] became the eastern end of the [[Hellenistic world]]. Following the conquest by [[Mauryan]] Indians, [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Hinduism]] flourished in the region for centuries. The [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka]], who ruled from his twin capitals of [[Kapisi]] and [[Puruṣapura]], played an important role in the spread of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism to China and Central Asia. Various other Buddhist dynasties originated from this region as well, including the [[Kidarites]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Alkhons]], [[Nezak]]s, [[Zunbils]] and [[Turk Shahi]]s.

[[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan|Muslims brought Islam]] to [[Sassanian]]-held [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in the mid-7th century, while fuller Islamization was achieved between the 9th and 12th centuries under the [[Saffarid]], [[Samanid]], [[Ghaznavid]], and [[Ghurid]] dynasties. Parts of the region were later ruled by the [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarazmian]], [[Khalji]], [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]], [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]], [[Sur Empire|Sur]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], and [[Safavid]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LclscNCTz9oC&amp;pg=PA52|title=The Far East and Australasia 2003|date=14 June 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the [[Hotak dynasty]], whose founder [[Mirwais Hotak]] declared southern Afghanistan independent in 1709. In 1747, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] established the [[Durrani Empire]] with its capital at [[Kandahar]]. In 1776, the Durrani capital was moved to Kabul while [[Peshawar]] became the winter capital;&lt;ref name="cap1"/&gt; the latter was [[Battle of Nowshera|lost to Sikhs in 1823]]. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in "[[the Great Game]]" between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=41–2|title=The Wars of Afghanistan|last1=Tomsen|first1=Peter |date=2014 |isbn=978-1610392624}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=187|title=Taliban |first1=Ahmed |last1=Rashid |date=2000|isbn=1-86064-417-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], the [[East India Company]] briefly seized control of Afghanistan, but following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919 the country was able to become independent from foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under [[Amanullah Khan]], until almost 50 years later when [[Zahir Shah]] was [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|overthrown]] and a [[Republic of Afghanistan|republic]] was established. In 1978, after a second coup, Afghanistan first became a socialist state, evoking the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in the 1980s against [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|mujahideen]] rebels. By 1996, most of the country was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist [[Taliban]], who ruled as a totalitarian regime; they were removed from power after the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|US invasion]] in 2001 but still control a significant portion of the country. The [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|ongoing war]] between the government and the Taliban has perpetuated Afghanistan's problematic [[Human rights in Afghanistan|human rights]] and [[Women's rights in Afghanistan|women's rights]] records, with numerous abuses committed by both sides, such as the killing of civilians, kidnapping and torture.

Afghanistan is a unitary presidential [[Islamic Republic]]. The country has high levels of [[terrorism]], poverty, child malnutrition, and corruption. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]], the [[Group of 77]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9&amp;nbsp;billion by [[purchasing power parity]]; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Afghanistan}}
The [[root (linguistics)|root]] name "[[Afghan (ethnonym)|''Afghān'']]" is, according to some scholars, derived from the name of the ''[[Aśvaka]]n'' or ''Assakan'', ancient inhabitants of the [[Hindu Kush]] region.&lt;ref&gt;''"The name Afghan has evidently been derived from Asvakan, the Assakenoi of Arrian... "'' (Megasthenes and Arrian, p 180. See also: Alexander's Invasion of India, p 38; J.W. McCrindle).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Even the name Afghan is Aryan being derived from Asvakayana, an important clan of the Asvakas or horsemen who must have derived this title from their handling of celebrated breeds of horses"'' (See: Imprints of Indian Thought and Culture abroad, p 124, Vivekananda Kendra Prakashan).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf: ''"Their name (Afghan) means "cavalier" being derived from the [[Sanskrit]], ''Asva'', or ''Asvaka'', a horse, and shows that their country must have been noted in ancient times, as it is at the present day, for its superior breed of horses. Asvaka was an important tribe settled north to Kabul river, which offered a gallant resistance but ineffectual resistance to the arms of Alexander "''(Ref: Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1999, p 275, Royal Scottish Geographical Society).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Afghans are Assakani of the [[Greeks]]; this word being the [[Sanskrit]] [[Ashvaka]] meaning 'horsemen' " ''  (Ref: Sva, 1915, p 113, Christopher Molesworth Birdwood).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf: ''"The name represents Sanskrit Asvaka in the sense of a ''cavalier'', and this reappears scarcely modified in the Assakani or Assakeni of the historians of the expedition of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]" '' (Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial [[Anglo-Indian]] words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological..by Henry Yule, AD Burnell).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aśvakan'' literally means "horsemen", "horse breeders", or "[[cavalry]]men" (from ''[[aśva]]'' or ''aspa'', the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Avestan]] words for "[[horse]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient India |first=Ramesh Chandra |last=Majumdar |author-link=Ramesh Chandra Majumdar |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1977 |orig-year=1952 |isbn=978-8-12080-436-4 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNxiN5tzKOgC&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the ethnonym ''Afghān'' was used to refer to ethnic [[Pashtuns]].&lt;ref name="Afghan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ch.

Therefore, "Afghanistan" translates to "land of the Afghans", or "land of the Pashtuns" in a historical sense. According to the third edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{EI3|last=Nölle-Karimi|first=Christine|title=Afghanistan until 1747|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/*-COM_24776|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The name Afghanistan (Afghānistān, land of the Afghans/Pashtuns, ''afāghina'', sing. ''afghān'') can be traced to the early eighth/fourteenth century, when it designated the easternmost part of the [[Kartid]] realm. This name was later used for certain regions in the Ṣafavid and Mughal empires that were inhabited by Afghans. While based on a state-supporting elite of [[Durrani|Abdālī/Durrānī]] Afghans, the [[Durrani Empire|Sadūzāʾī Durrānī polity]] that came into being in 1160/1747 was not called Afghanistan in its own day. The name became a state designation only during the colonial intervention of the nineteenth century.}}

Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrians]], [[Indo-Scythians]], [[Kushan]]s, [[Kidarites]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Alkhons]], [[Nezaks]], [[Zunbils]], [[Turk Shahi]]s, [[Hindu Shahi]]s, [[Lawiks]], [[Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurids]], [[Khwarazmians]], [[Khalji]]s, [[Kartids]], [[Lodi dynasty|Lodis]], [[Sur Empire|Surs]], [[Mughals]], and finally, the [[Hotak dynasty|Hotak]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties, which marked the political origins of the modern state.{{sfn|Runion|2007|page=44-49}} Throughout millennia several cities within the modern day Afghanistan served as capitals of various empires, namely Bactra ([[Balkh]]), Alexandria on the Oxus ([[Ai-Khanoum]]), [[Kapisi]], [[Sigal, Sakastan|Sigal]], [[Kabul]], [[Kunduz]], [[Zaranj]], [[Firozkoh]], [[Herat]], Ghazna ([[Ghazni]]), Binban ([[Bamyan]]), and [[Kandahar]].

The country has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region.

===Prehistory and antiquity===
{{Main|Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan}}
Excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [[Egypt]] in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="JFS"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |title=Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska |publisher=Encarta |access-date=19 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717092902/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |archive-date=17 July 2004 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |title=Afghanistan: A Treasure Trove for Archaeologists |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=26 February 2009 |access-date=13 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726153721/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1881896-1%2C00.html |archive-date=26 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron Age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) was a center of the [[Helmand culture]]. More recent findings established that the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilization today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Indus pp.1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society|page=1|author=Rita Wright|date=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAgFPQAACAAJ|isbn=978-0521576529|access-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628065355/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAgFPQAACAAJ|archive-date=28 June 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998).

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].&lt;ref name="JFS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]]. Ancient [[Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au | date=15 February 1989 |access-date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region of [[Arachosia]], around Kandahar in modern-day southern Afghanistan, used to be primarily Zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the Avesta to [[Persis|Persia]] and is thus considered by some to be the "second homeland of Zoroastriansm".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gnoli|first=Gherado|title=The Idea of Iran, an Essay on its Origin|publisher=Istituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente|year=1989|pages=133|quote=... he would have drawn inspiration from a ireligious policy which intended to counteract the Median Magi's influence and transfer the 'Avesta-Schule' from Arachosia to Persia: thus the Avesta would have arrived in Persia through Arachosia in the 6th century B.C.

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived in Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="LoC-pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan | date=August 2008 |access-date=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Runion|2007|page=44}}

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]]s who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. They were replaced by the [[Turk Shahi]] in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called [[Hindu Shahi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wink|first=André|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7Th-11th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=0-391-04173-8|page=125|access-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201142728/https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA125|archive-date=1 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by [[Buddhist]] culture.&lt;ref name="Habibi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023100306/http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|archive-date=23 October 2008 |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|access-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Higham|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&amp;pg=PA141|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&amp;nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted.

The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&amp;nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the [[Hindu]] Kush.

By the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]] in the west and the [[Sikh Empire]] in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzai tribe]], had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire.

During [[World War I]], when Afghanistan was neutral, Habibullah Khan was met by officials of the Central Powers in the [[Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition]], to declare full independence from the United Kingdom, join them and attack British India, as part of the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy]]. Their efforts to bring Afghanistan into the Central Powers failed, but it caused discontent among the population for keeping neutrality against the British. Habibullah was assassinated during a hunting trip in 1919, and [[Amanullah Khan]] eventually assumed power.

Some of the reforms that were put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of several co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders, and this led to the [[Afghan Civil War (1928–1929)]].

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. The [[Afghan tribal revolts of 1944–1947|tribal revolts of 1944–1947]] saw Zahir Shah's reign challenged by [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], [[Safi (Pashtun tribe)|Safi]], [[Mangal (Pashtun tribe)|Mangal]], and [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazir]] tribesmen led by [[Mazrak Zadran]], [[Salemai]], and [[Faqir Ipi|Mirzali Khan]], among others, many of whom were [[Amanullah loyalist]]s. Close relations with the Muslim states Turkey, the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] and [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran/Persia]] were also pursued, while further international relations were sought by joining the [[League of Nations]] in 1934. The 1930s saw the development of roads, infrastructure, the founding of a [[Da Afghanistan Bank|national bank]], and increased education. Road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry.&lt;ref name="Eur2002"/&gt; The country built close relationships with the [[Axis powers]], with Germany having the largest share in Afghan development at the time, along with Italy and Japan.&lt;ref name="Hyman2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Afghanistan under Soviet Domination, 1964–91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvO-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-21948-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law, and a [[Pashtun]] nationalist who sought the creation of a [[Pashtunistan]], leading to highly tense relations with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1103837.html|title=Afghanistan: History Of 1973 Coup Sheds Light On Relations With Pakistan|access-date=6 July 2019|date=18 July 2003|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|author=Ron Synovitz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626230602/https://www.rferl.org/a/1103837.html|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his ten years at the post until 1963, Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]]. Afterward, the [[1964 Constitution of Afghanistan|1964 constitution]] was formed, and the first non-royal Prime Minister was sworn in.&lt;ref name="Eur2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eur|title=The Far East and Australasia 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LclscNCTz9oC&amp;pg=PA62|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85743-133-9|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the United Kingdom. However, Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]] thereafter. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure in the post-war period. On a per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. Afghanistan had, therefore, good relations with both Cold War enemies. In 1973, while the King was in Italy, Daoud Khan launched a [[1973 Afghan coup|bloodless coup]] and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]], abolishing the monarchy.

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], in what is called the [[Saur Revolution]]. The PDPA declared the establishment of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], with its first leader named as [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|People's Democratic Party]] general secretary [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]].{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=186-88}} This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit peaceful) country to a hotbed of international terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0FvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR16|title=Afghanistan War: A Documentary and Reference Guide|first=Ryan|last=Wadle|date=1 October 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781440857478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents. This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] by 1979, waged by guerrilla ''[[mujahideen]]'' (and smaller [[Maoist]] guerillas) against regime forces countrywide.

Several types of [[mammal]]s exist throughout Afghanistan. [[Snow leopard]]s, [[Siberian tiger]]s and [[brown bear]]s live in the high elevation [[alpine tundra]] regions. The [[Marco Polo sheep]] exclusively live in the [[Wakhan Corridor]] region of north-east Afghanistan. [[Fox]]es, [[wolves]], [[otter]]s, [[deer]], [[wild sheep]], [[lynx]] and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east. In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, [[hedgehog]]s, [[gopher]]s, and large carnivores such as [[jackal]]s and [[hyena]]s.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5QY3vCg338C&amp;pg=PA22|title=Afghanistan, Second Edition|first1=Jeffrey A.|last1=Gritzner|first2=John F.|last2=Shroder|date=14 June 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438104805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanisation===
As estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020. This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than [[Cambodia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital [[Kabul]], due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/20/can-cities-save-afghanistan/|title=Can Cities Save Afghanistan?|first=Ali|last=Karimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/unraveling-afghan-art-carpet-weaving-201410917826901821.html|title=Unravelling the Afghan art of carpet weaving|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul, located in the east of the country. The other large cities are located generally in the "ring" around the Central Highlands, namely [[Kandahar]] in the south, [[Herat]] in the west, [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] and [[Kunduz]] in the north, and [[Jalalabad]] in the east.&lt;ref name="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/afghanistan-population/" /&gt;

Different regions of Afghanistan have distinctive cultures, partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a [[patriarch]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afghanistans.com/Information/People/WayofLife.htm|title=Afghanistan Way of Life &amp;#124; Afghanistan's Web Site|website=www.afghanistans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the [[Pashtun culture]] by following [[Pashtunwali]] (the Pashtun way).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aftoc.html|archive-url=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041017061103/lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aftoc.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 October 2004|title=Afghanistan: a country study|date=1998|publisher=[[Library of Congress]], [[Federal Research Division]]|editor-last=Blood|editor-first=Peter R.|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=904447770|postscript=. {{PD-notice}}|entry=Pashtun|entry-url=https://webharvest.gov/peth04/20041031011222/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037)|access-date=23 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key tenets of Pashtunwali include [[melmastia|hospitality]], the provision of [[nanawatai|sanctuary]] to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood.{{sfn|Dupree|1997|page=126}} The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of [[Central Asia]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. The remaining Afghans are culturally [[Persianization|Persian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]. Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called [[Pashtunization]], while some Pashtuns have been [[Persianization|Persianized]]. Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations. The Afghan people are known to be strongly religious.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Afghans, particularly Pashtuns, are noted for their tribal solidarity and high regard for personal honor.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=59}} One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Heathcote"&gt;Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839–1919", Sellmount Staplehurst.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various [[ethnic groups in Afghanistan|Afghan tribes]], and an estimated 2–3&amp;nbsp;million [[Kochi people|nomads]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76794 Afghanistan: Kuchi nomads seek a better deal]".

[[File:Kuchi Village.jpg|thumb|A house occupied by nomadic ''kochi'' people in [[Nangarhar Province]]]]
In the villages, families typically occupy [[mudbrick]] houses, or compounds with mudbrick or [[stone wall]]ed houses. Villages typically have a headman (''malik''), a master for water distribution (''mirab'') and a religious teacher (''mullah''). Men would typically work on the fields, joined by women during harvest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; About 15% of the population are [[nomadic]], locally called ''[[kochi]]s''.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; When nomads pass villages they often buy supplies such as tea, wheat and [[kerosene]] from the villagers; villagers buy [[wool]] and milk from the nomads.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Old men of Herat, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Old men in [[Herat]] wearing ''perahan tunban'' with a turban (''lungi'')]]
[[Afghan clothing]] for both men and women typically consists of various forms of [[shalwar kameez]], especially ''[[perahan tunban]]'' and ''[[khet partug]]''. Women would normally wear a ''[[chador]]'' for head covering; some women, typically from highly conservative communities, wear the ''[[burqa]]'', a full body covering. These were worn by some women of the Pashtun community well before Islam came to the region, but the [[Taliban]] enforced this dress on women when they were in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7ATBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|title=What Is Veiling?|first=Sahar|last=Amer|date=2 September 2014|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469617763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular dress is the ''[[chapan]]'' which acts as a coat. The ''[[Karakul (hat)|karakul]]'' is a hat made from the fur of a specific regional breed of sheep.

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Afghanistan}}
The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. Afghanistan contains many remnants from all ages, including [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Buddhist]] stupas, monasteries, monuments, temples and Islamic minarets. Among the most well known are the [[Great Mosque of Herat]], the [[Blue Mosque (Mazar-i-Sharif)|Blue Mosque]], the [[Minaret of Jam]], the [[Chil Zena]], the Qala-i Bost in [[Lashkargah]], the ancient Greek city of [[Ai-Khanoum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afghanistans.com/Information/People/ArtArchitecture.htm|title=Afghanistan Art and Architecture &amp;#124; Afghanistan's Web Site|website=www.afghanistans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;G.V. Brandolini. ''Afghanistan [[cultural heritage]]''. Orizzonte terra, [[Bergamo]]. 2007. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The two famous [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[idolatrous]]. Despite that, archaeologists are still finding Buddhist relics in different parts of the country, some of them dating back to the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre67g1cn-us-afghanistan-buddhist-relics/ |title=Afghan archaeologists find Buddhist site as war rages |access-date=16 August 2010 |work=Sayed Salahuddin | date=17 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818151642/http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre67g1cn-us-afghanistan-buddhist-relics/ |archive-date=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare; most notably the Victory Arch at [[Paghman]], and the [[Darul Aman Palace]] in Kabul, were built in this style in the 1920s by the Afghans themselves.

=== Literature ===
{{main|Poetry of Afghanistan}}

Classic [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Pashto poetry]] are a cherished part of Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/10/567862-feature-western-afghanistan-ancient-love-poetry-thrives-again|title=FEATURE: In Western Afghanistan, an ancient love of poetry thrives again|date=5 October 2017|website=UN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the poetic styles is called [[Landay (poetry)|landay]]. A popular theme in Afghan folklore and mythology are [[Dev (mythology)|devs]], monstrous creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXnEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|title=American Myths, Legends, and Tall Tales: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore (3 Volumes)|first1=Christopher R.|last1=Fee|first2=Jeffrey B.|last2=Webb|date=29 August 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thursdays are traditionally "poetry night" in the city of [[Herat]] when men, women and children gather and recite both ancient and modern poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13931608|title=Afghanistan: 10 facts you may not know|work=BBC News|date=6 July 2011|via=BBC|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304072803/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13931608|archive-date=4 March 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afghan region has produced countless Persian-speaking poets and writers from the Middle Ages to the present day, among which three mystical authors are considered true national glories (although claimed with equal ardor by Iran), namely: [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]] of Herat, a great mystic and [[Sufi]] saint in the 11th century, [[Sanai]] of Ghazni, author of mystical poems in the 12th century, and, finally, [[Rumi]] of Balkh, in the 13th century, considered the persophonist throughout the world as the greatest mystical poet of the entire Muslim world. The Afghan Pashto literature, although quantitatively remarkable and in great growth in the last century, has always had an essentially local meaning and importance, feeling the influence of both Persian literature and the contiguous literatures of India. Both main literatures, from the second half of the nineteenth century, have shown themselves to be sensitive to genres (novel, theater), movements and stylistic features imported from Europe.

[[Khushal Khan Khattak]] of the 17th century is considered the national poet. Other notable poets include [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Jami]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Khalilullah Khalili]], and [[Parween Pazhwak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html |title=Classical Dari and Pashto Poets |publisher=Afghan-web.com |access-date=4 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412113451/http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html|archive-date=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
