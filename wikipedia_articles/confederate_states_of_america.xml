The Confederacy was formed on February 8, 1861 by an initial seven [[Slave states and free states|slave states]]: [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]], [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana]], and [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; All seven of the states were located in the [[Deep South]] region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture—particularly cotton—and a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation system]] that relied upon [[Slavery in the United States|slaves of African descent]] for labor.&lt;ref name="IndEcon" /&gt; Convinced that [[white supremacy]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the [[Slavery in the United States|institution of slavery]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confederate-States-of-America|title=Confederate States of America|last=Editors|date=July 20, 1998|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=June 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|title-link=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|last=M.

Before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861, a provisional Confederate government was established on February 8, 1861. It was considered illegal by the United States federal government, and many Northerners thought of the Confederates as [[traitor]]s. After war began in April, four slave states of the [[Upper South]]—[[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]]—also joined the Confederacy. The Confederacy later accepted the slave states of [[Confederate government of Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Kentucky]] as members, accepting rump state assembly declarations of secession as authorization for full delegations of representatives and senators in the Confederate Congress; they were never substantially controlled by Confederate forces, despite the efforts of Confederate [[wikt:shadow government|shadow governments]], which were eventually expelled. The government of the United States (the Union) rejected the claims of secession as illegitimate.

The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederates attacked Fort Sumter]], a Union fort in the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. No foreign government ever recognized the Confederacy as an independent country,&lt;ref name="history-state-gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McPherson"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195313666 |url-access=registration |title=This mighty scourge: perspectives on the Civil War |first=James M. |last=McPherson |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2007 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195313666/page/65 65]|isbn=9780198042761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas256"&gt;[[Emory M.

In 1865, the Confederacy's civilian government disintegrated in a chaotic manner: the [[Confederate States Congress]] [[adjournment sine die|adjourned sine die]], effectively ceasing to exist as a legislative body on March 18. After four years of heavy fighting and 620,000–850,000 military deaths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/pdfs/civil-was-curriculum-medicine.pdf|title=Learn – Civil War Trust|website=www.civilwar.org|date=October 29, 2013|access-date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/recounting-the-dead/|title=Recounting the Dead|last=Hacker|first=J.

The war lacked a formal end, with Confederate forces surrendering or disbanding sporadically throughout most of 1865. The most significant capitulation was Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender to [[Ulysses S. Grant]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] on April 9, after which any lingering doubt regarding the war's outcome and/or the Confederacy's prospect for survival was extinguished, although another sizable force under Confederate general [[Joseph E. Johnston]] did not formally surrender to [[William T. Sherman]] until April 26.

However, May 5, 1865 was the last day anyone holding a Confederate office recognized by the secessionist governments attempted to exercise executive, legislative, or judicial power under the C.S. Constitution. For this reason, that date is generally recognized to be the day the Confederate States of America formally dissolved.&lt;/ref&gt; and Davis himself acknowledged in later writings that the Confederacy "disappeared" in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis|first=Jefferson|url=https://archive.org/stream/ashorthistoryco00davigoog#page/n544/mode/2up/search/disappeared|title=Short History of the Confederate States of America|page=503|date=1890|access-date=February 10, 2015|publisher=Belford co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 1865, US president [[Andrew Johnson]] officially called an end to the armed resistance in the South.

After the war, Confederate states were readmitted to the Congress during the [[Reconstruction era]], after each ratified the [[13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] outlawing slavery. "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]" ideology was an idealized view of the Confederacy, valiantly fighting for a just cause. It emerged in the [[Reconstruction era|decades after the war]] among former Confederate generals and politicians, as well as organizations such as the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] and the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]]. Particularly intense periods of Lost Cause activity developed around the time of [[World War I]], and during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s in [[Reactionary|reaction]] to growing public support for [[racial equality]]. Lost Cause advocates sought to ensure future generations of Southern [[White Americans|whites]] would continue to support white supremacist policies such as the [[Jim Crow laws]] through activities such as building prominent [[List of Confederate monuments and memorials|Confederate monuments]] and writing school history [[textbook]]s to paint the Confederacy in a favorable light.&lt;ref name="Blight2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David W.

Uncolored areas were U.S. territories, with the exception of the [[Indian Territory]] (later [[Oklahoma]]).]] 
On February 22, 1862, the Confederate States Constitution of seven state signatories – [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]], [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]], [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana]], and [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]] – replaced the [[Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States|Provisional Constitution]] of February 8, 1861, with one stating in its preamble a desire for a "permanent federal government". Four additional slave-holding states – [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] – declared their secession and joined the Confederacy following [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|a call]] by U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] for troops from each state to recapture [[Fort Sumter|Sumter]] and other seized federal properties in the South.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;David R. Zimring, "'Secession in Favor of the Constitution': How West Virginia Justified Separate Statehood during the Civil War." ''West Virginia History'' 3.2 (2009): 23–51. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/361971/summary online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]] and [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] were represented by partisan factions adopting the forms of state governments without control of substantial territory or population in either case. The [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] state governments in both maintained their representation in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Also fighting for the Confederacy were two of the "[[Five Civilized Tribes]]" – the [[Choctaw]] and the [[Chickasaw]] – in [[Indian Territory]] and a new, but uncontrolled, [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]]. Efforts by certain factions in [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]] to secede were halted by federal imposition of [[martial law]]; [[Delaware in the American Civil War|Delaware]], though of divided loyalty, did not attempt it. A Unionist government was formed in opposition to the secessionist state government in Richmond and administered the western parts of Virginia that had been occupied by Federal troops. The [[Restored Government of Virginia]] later recognized the new state of [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]], which was admitted to the Union during the war on June 20, 1863, and relocated to [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name="online"/&gt;

Confederate control over its claimed territory and population in congressional districts steadily shrank from three-quarters to a third during the [[American Civil War]] due to the Union's successful overland campaigns, its control of inland waterways into the South, and its [[Union blockade|blockade]] of the southern coast.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, Kenneth C., op. cit., 1994, pp. 43–53.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, the Union made abolition of slavery a war goal (in addition to reunion). As Union forces moved southward, large numbers of plantation slaves were freed. Many joined the Union lines, enrolling in service as soldiers, teamsters and laborers. The most notable advance was Sherman's "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]" in late 1864. Much of the Confederacy's infrastructure was destroyed, including telegraphs, railroads and bridges. Plantations in the path of Sherman's forces were severely damaged. Internal movement within the Confederacy became increasingly difficult, weakening its economy and limiting army mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Burke Davis, ''Sherman's march'' (2016) ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

These losses created an insurmountable disadvantage in men, [[materiel]], and finance. Public support for Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]'s administration eroded over time due to repeated military reverses, economic hardships, and allegations of autocratic government. After four years of campaigning, Richmond was captured by Union forces in April 1865. A few days later General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered to Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], effectively signalling the collapse of the Confederacy. President Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, and jailed for treason, but no trial was ever held.&lt;ref&gt;Weigley (2000), p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:CSA states evolution.gif|thumb|upright=1.8|Evolution of the Confederate States, December 20, 1860 – July 15, 1870]]
The Confederacy was established in the [[Montgomery Convention]] in February 1861 by seven states ([[South Carolina in the Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Alabama in the Civil War|Alabama]], [[Florida in the Civil War|Florida]], [[Georgia in the Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the Civil War|Louisiana]], adding [[Texas in the Civil War|Texas]] in March before Lincoln's inauguration), expanded in May–July 1861 (with [[Virginia in the Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the Civil War|Tennessee]], [[North Carolina in the Civil War|North Carolina]]), and disintegrated in April–May 1865. It was formed by delegations from seven slave states of the [[Lower South]] that had proclaimed their secession from the Union. After the fighting began in April, four additional slave states seceded and were admitted. Later, two slave states (Missouri and Kentucky) and two territories were given seats in the Confederate Congress.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis, 1848–1861'' (1976) pp. 484–514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern nationalism was swelling and pride supported the new founding.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pp 448–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Emory M. Thomas |title= The Confederate Nation: 1861 to 1865 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_vM2r5CXP3kC&amp;pg=PT44 |year=1979|publisher= HarperCollins |page=44|isbn= 9780062069467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate nationalism prepared men to fight for "the Cause". For the duration of its existence, the Confederacy underwent trial by war.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas. ''The Confederate Nation''. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Southern Cause" transcended the ideology of [[states' rights]], tariff policy, and internal improvements. This "Cause" supported, or derived from, cultural and financial dependence on the South's slavery-based economy. The convergence of race and slavery, politics, and economics raised almost all South-related policy questions to the status of moral questions over way of life, commingling love of things Southern and hatred of things Northern. Not only did national political parties split, but national churches and interstate families as well divided along sectional lines as the war approached.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas. ''The Confederate Nation''. pp. 4–5 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian John M. Coski,
{{quote|The statesmen who led the secession movement were unashamed to explicitly cite the defense of [[slavery]] as their prime motive&amp;nbsp;...

Southern Democrats had chosen [[John C. Breckinridge|John Breckinridge]] as their candidate during the U.S. presidential election of 1860, but in no Southern state (other than South Carolina, where the legislature chose the electors) was support for him unanimous; all the other states recorded at least some popular votes for one or more of the other three candidates (Abraham Lincoln, [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]). Support for these candidates, collectively, ranged from significant to an outright majority, with extremes running from 25% in Texas to 81% in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1860|title=1860 Presidential General Election Results |access-date= September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were minority views everywhere, especially in the upland and plateau areas of the South, being particularly concentrated in western Virginia and eastern Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;The first six signatory states establishing the Confederacy counted about one-fourth its population. They voted 43% for pro-Union candidates. The four states which entered after the attack on Fort Sumter held almost half the population of the Confederacy and voted 53% for pro-Union candidates. The three big turnout states voted extremes. Texas, with 5% of the population, voted 20% for pro-Union candidates. Kentucky and Missouri, with one-fourth the Confederate population, voted a combined 68% for the pro-Union Lincoln, Douglas and Bell. See Table of election returns at [[1860 United States presidential election]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following South Carolina's unanimous 1860 secession vote, no other Southern states considered the question until 1861, and when they did none had a unanimous vote. All had residents who cast significant numbers of Unionist votes in either the legislature, conventions, popular referendums, or in all three. Voting to remain in the Union did not necessarily mean that individuals were sympathizers with the North. Once hostilities began, many of these who voted to remain in the Union, particularly in the Deep South, accepted the majority decision, and supported the Confederacy.&lt;ref name="personal.tcu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/Crofts.htm |title=Reluctant Confederates |publisher= Personal.tcu.edu |access-date= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers have evaluated the Civil War as an American tragedy—a "Brothers' War", pitting "brother against brother, father against son, kin against kin of every degree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Coulter |first=E.

===A revolution in disunion===
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War}}
{{See also|Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War}}
According to historian Avery O. Craven in 1950, the Confederate States of America nation, as a state power, was created by [[Secession in the United States|secessionists]] in Southern slave states, who believed that the federal government was making them second-class citizens and refused to honor their belief – that [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was beneficial to the [[African American|Negro]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated350"&gt;Craven, Avery O., ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism. 1848–1861'' (1953). p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; They judged the agents of change to be [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and anti-slavery elements in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], whom they believed used repeated insult and injury to subject them to intolerable "humiliation and degradation".&lt;ref name="autogenerated350"/&gt; The "Black Republicans" (as the Southerners called them) and their allies soon dominated the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency. On the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] (a presumed supporter of slavery) was 83 years old and ailing.

During [[1860 United States presidential election|the campaign for president in 1860]], some secessionists threatened disunion should Lincoln (who opposed the expansion of slavery into the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]) be elected, including [[William L. Yancey]]. Yancey toured the North calling for secession as [[Stephen A. Douglas]] toured the South calling for union if Lincoln was elected.&lt;ref name="disunion_v_ii"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Freehling |first1= William W. |title= The Road to Disunion: Volume II, Secessionists Triumphant |year=1990 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York }} p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; To the secessionists the Republican intent was clear: to contain slavery within its present bounds and, eventually, to eliminate it entirely. A Lincoln victory presented them with a momentous choice (as they saw it), even before his inauguration – "the Union without slavery, or slavery without the Union".&lt;ref&gt;Craven. ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism''. p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causes of secession====

{{quote box
|quote=
The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the "rock upon which the old Union would split." He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.

The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the [[Racial equality|assumption of the equality of races.]] This was an error. It was a [[Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders|sandy foundation]], and [[United States of America|the idea of a Government built upon it]]—when the [[Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders|"storm came and the wind blew, it fell."]]

Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, [[racism|upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man]]; that [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, [[white supremacy|based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.]]

The immediate catalyst for secession was the victory of the Republican Party and the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in the 1860 elections. American Civil War historian [[James M. McPherson]] suggested that, for Southerners, the most ominous feature of the Republican victories in the congressional and presidential elections of 1860 was the magnitude of those victories: Republicans captured over 60 percent of the Northern vote and three-fourths of its Congressional delegations. The Southern press said that such Republicans represented the anti-slavery portion of the North, "a party founded on the single sentiment&amp;nbsp;... of hatred of African slavery", and now the controlling power in national affairs. The "Black Republican party" could overwhelm conservative Yankees. ''The New Orleans Delta'' said of the Republicans, "It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party" to overthrow slavery.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson. pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South concerned primarily the maintenance or expansion of [[slavery in the United States]]. Historian [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] observed that "leaders of the secession movement across the South cited slavery as the most compelling reason for southern independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faust |first= Drew Gilpin |author-link= Drew Gilpin Faust |title= The Creation of Confederate Nationalism: Ideology and Identity in the Civil War South |year=1988 |publisher= Louisiana State University Press |location= Baton Rouge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most white Southerners did not own slaves, the majority supported the institution of slavery and benefited indirectly from the slave society. For struggling yeomen and subsistence farmers, the slave society provided a large class of people ranked lower in the social scale than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Murrin |first=John |title= Liberty, Equality, Power |year=2001 |page=1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary differences related to issues of free speech, runaway slaves, expansion into Cuba, and [[states' rights]].

Historian [[Emory Thomas]] assessed the Confederacy's self-image by studying correspondence sent by the Confederate government in 1861–62 to foreign governments. He found that Confederate diplomacy projected multiple contradictory self-images:

{{quote|The Southern nation was by turns a guileless people attacked by a voracious neighbor, an 'established' nation in some temporary difficulty, a collection of [[wikt:bucolic|bucolic]] aristocrats making a romantic stand against the banalities of [[industrial democracy]], a cabal of commercial farmers seeking to make a pawn of [[King Cotton]], an apotheosis of nineteenth-century nationalism and revolutionary liberalism, or the ultimate statement of social and economic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Emory M. Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation: 1861–1865'' (1979), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In what later became known as the [[Cornerstone Speech]], Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens]] declared that the "cornerstone" of the new government "rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery – subordination to the superior race – is his natural and normal condition.

Georgia also claimed a general Federal policy of favoring Northern over Southern economic interests. Texas mentioned slavery 21 times, but also listed the failure of the federal government to live up to its obligations, in the original annexation agreement, to protect settlers along the exposed western frontier. Texas resolutions further stated that governments of the states and the nation were established "exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity". They also stated that although equal civil and political rights applied to all white men, they did not apply to those of the "African race", further opining that the end of racial enslavement would "bring inevitable calamities upon both [races] and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states".&lt;ref name="Thetext" /&gt;

Alabama did not provide a separate declaration of causes. Instead, the Alabama ordinance stated "the election of Abraham Lincoln&amp;nbsp;... by a sectional party, avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama, preceded by many and dangerous infractions of the Constitution of the United States by many of the States and people of the northern section, is a political wrong of so insulting and menacing a character as to justify the people of the State of Alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security". The ordinance invited "the slaveholding States of the South, who may approve such purpose, in order to frame a provisional as well as a permanent Government upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States" to participate in a February 4, 1861 [[Montgomery Convention|convention]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/history/constitutions/1861/1861ord1_20.html#anchor588392 |title=Constitution of 1861, Ordinances 1 – 20 |publisher=Legislature.state.al.us |access-date= April 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426223827/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/history/constitutions/1861/1861ord1_20.html#anchor588392 |archive-date= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas's secession ordinance encompassed a strong objection to the use of military force to preserve the Union as its motivating reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#Arkansas |title=Ordinances of Secession |publisher=Constitution.org |access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the outbreak of war, the Arkansas Convention had on March 20 given as their first resolution: "The people of the Northern States have organized a political party, purely sectional in its character, the central and controlling idea of which is hostility to the institution of African slavery, as it exists in the Southern States; and that party has elected a President&amp;nbsp;... pledged to administer the Government upon principles inconsistent with the rights and subversive of the interests of the Southern States."&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Both Sessions of the Conventions of the State of Arkansas: Which Were Begun and Held in the Capitol, in the City of Little Rock'', 1861, pp. 51–54&lt;/ref&gt;

North Carolina and Tennessee limited their ordinances to simply withdrawing, although Tennessee went so far as to make clear they wished to make no comment at all on the "abstract doctrine of secession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#North%20Carolina |title=Ordinances of Secession |publisher=Constitution.org |access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#Tennessee |title=Ordinances of Secession |publisher=Constitution.org |access-date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a message to the Confederate Congress on April 29, 1861 [[Jefferson Davis]] cited both the tariff{{Clarify|reason=specify tariff|date=July 2021}} and slavery for the South's secession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=524-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22annual+register,+1861%22#v=onepage Annual Register... for 1861] (1862) pp. 233–239&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secessionists and conventions====
The pro-slavery "[[Fire-Eaters]]" group of Southern Democrats, calling for immediate secession, were opposed by two factions. "[[Cooperationists]]" in the Deep South would delay secession until several states left the union, perhaps in a Southern Convention. Under the influence of men such as Texas Governor [[Sam Houston]], delay would have the effect of sustaining the Union.&lt;ref name="Freehling, pp. 448"&gt;Freehling, pp. 448+&lt;/ref&gt; "Unionists", especially in the Border South, often former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], appealed to sentimental attachment to the United States. Southern Unionists' favorite presidential candidate was [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee, sometimes running under an "Opposition Party" banner.&lt;ref name="Freehling, pp. 448"/&gt;

&lt;gallery style="float:right; text-align:center;" perrow="2"&gt;

File:William Henry Gist.jpg|[[William Henry Gist]], {{small|Governor of South Carolina, called the Secessionist Convention}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Many secessionists were active politically. Governor [[William Henry Gist]] of South Carolina corresponded secretly with other Deep South governors, and most southern governors exchanged clandestine commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Charleston]]'s secessionist "1860 Association" published over 200,000 pamphlets to persuade the youth of the South. The most influential were: "The Doom of Slavery" and "The South Alone Should Govern the South", both by John Townsend of South Carolina; and James D. B. De Bow's "The Interest of Slavery of the Southern Non-slaveholder".&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 391–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in South Carolina started a chain of events. The foreman of a jury refused the legitimacy of federal courts, so [[Andrew Magrath|Federal Judge Andrew Magrath]] ruled that U.S. judicial authority in South Carolina was vacated. A mass meeting in Charleston celebrating the Charleston and Savannah railroad and state cooperation led to the South Carolina legislature to call for a Secession Convention. [[James Chesnut, Jr.|U.S. Senator James Chesnut, Jr.]] resigned, as did [[James Henry Hammond|Senator James Henry Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections for Secessionist conventions were heated to "an almost raving pitch, no one dared dissent", according to historian [[William W. Freehling]]. Even once–respected voices, including the Chief Justice of South Carolina, [[John Belton O'Neall]], lost election to the Secession Convention on a Cooperationist ticket. Across the South mobs expelled Yankees and (in Texas) executed [[German-Americans]] suspected of loyalty to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 418+&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, seceding conventions which followed did not call for a referendum to ratify, although Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee did, as well as Virginia's second convention. Kentucky declared neutrality, while Missouri had its own civil war until the Unionists took power and drove the Confederate legislators out of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Young|title=Dissent: The History of an American Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUWbBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193|year=2015|publisher=NYU Press|page=193|isbn=9781479814527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts to thwart secession====
In the antebellum months, the [[Corwin Amendment]] was an unsuccessful attempt by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to bring the seceding states back to the Union and to convince the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Eliot Morison|title=The Oxford History of the American People|year=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=609|author-link=Samuel Eliot Morison}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution by [[Thomas Corwin|Ohio Congressman Thomas Corwin]] that would shield "domestic institutions" of the states (which in 1861 included slavery) from the constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress.&lt;ref name='AmendmentsNotRatified'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|title=Constitutional Amendments Not Ratified|access-date=2013-11-21|publisher=United States House of Representatives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702135703/http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|archive-date=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostamendment.com/|title=Ghost Amendment: The Thirteenth Amendment That Never Was|last=Walter|first=Michael|year=2003|access-date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was passed by the [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress|36th Congress]] on March 2, 1861. The House approved it by a vote of 133 to 65 and the United States Senate adopted it, with no changes, on a vote of 24 to 12. It was then submitted to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gettysburgcompiler.org/2017/04/10/the-corwin-amendment-the-last-last-minute-attempt-to-save-the-union/|title=The Corwin Amendment: The Last Last-Minute Attempt to Save the Union|last=Christensen|first=Hannah|date=April 2017|website=The Gettysburg Compiler|access-date=November 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014256/https://gettysburgcompiler.org/2017/04/10/the-corwin-amendment-the-last-last-minute-attempt-to-save-the-union/|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his inaugural address Lincoln endorsed the proposed amendment.

The text was as follows:

{{quote|No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.}}

Had it been ratified by the required number of states prior to 1865, it would have made institutionalized slavery immune to the constitutional amendment procedures and to interference by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/failure-compromise/resources/proposed-thirteenth-amendment-prevent-secession-1861|title=A proposed Thirteenth Amendment to prevent secession, 1861|website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=R.

====Inauguration and response====
[[File:1861 Davis Inaugural.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The inauguration of [[Jefferson Davis]] in Montgomery, Alabama]]
The first secession state conventions from the Deep South sent representatives to meet at the [[Montgomery Convention]] in Montgomery, Alabama, on February 4, 1861. There the fundamental documents of government were promulgated, a provisional government was established, and a representative Congress met for the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name="Freehling"&gt;Freehling, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 'provisional' Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] issued a call for 100,000 men from the various states' militias to defend the newly formed Confederacy.&lt;ref name="Freehling" /&gt; All Federal property was seized, along with gold bullion and coining dies at the U.S. mints in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], North Carolina; [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], Georgia; and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="Freehling" /&gt; The Confederate capital was moved from Montgomery to Richmond, Virginia, in May 1861. On February 22, 1862, Davis was inaugurated as president with a term of six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Wright|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Civil War Era Biographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_wpKWzSmvUC&amp;pg=PA150|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=150|isbn=9780415878036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly inaugurated Confederate administration pursued a policy of national territorial integrity, continuing earlier state efforts in 1860 and early 1861 to remove U.S. government presence from within their boundaries. These efforts included taking possession of U.S. courts, custom houses, post offices, and most notably, arsenals and forts. But after the Confederate attack and capture of [[Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, Lincoln called up [[75,000 volunteers|75,000 of the states' militia]] to muster under his command. The stated purpose was to re-occupy U.S. properties throughout the South, as the U.S. Congress had not authorized their abandonment. The resistance at Fort Sumter signaled his change of policy from that of the Buchanan Administration. Lincoln's response ignited a firestorm of emotion. The people of both North and South demanded war, and young men rushed to their colors in the hundreds of thousands. Four more states (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) refused Lincoln's call for troops and declared secession, while Kentucky maintained an uneasy "neutrality".&lt;ref name="Freehling" /&gt;

===Secession===
Secessionists argued that the United States Constitution was a contract among sovereign states that could be abandoned at any time without consultation and that each state had a right to secede. After intense debates and statewide votes, seven [[Deep South]] cotton states passed secession ordinances by February 1861 (before Abraham Lincoln took office as president), while secession efforts failed in the other eight slave states. Delegates from those seven formed the CSA in February 1861, selecting [[Jefferson Davis]] as the provisional president. Unionist talk of reunion failed and Davis began raising a 100,000 man army.&lt;ref&gt;February 28, 1861, Congress authorized Davis to accept state militias into national service. Confederate Act of Congress for "provisionals" on March 6, 1861, authorized 100,000 militia and volunteers under Davis' command. May 6, Congress empowered Davis to accept volunteers directly without state intermediaries. Keegan, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7O0FYunvPwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=confederate+called+up+100,00+militia#v=onepage The American Civil War: a military history] 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26343-8}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

====States====
Initially, some secessionists may have hoped for a peaceful departure.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Emory T., ''The Confederate Nation: 1861–1865'', 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-090703-7}} Chapter 3. "Foundations of the Southern Nation". pp. 59, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Moderates in the Confederate Constitutional Convention included a provision against importation of slaves from Africa to appeal to the Upper South. Non-slave states might join, but the radicals secured a two-thirds requirement in both houses of Congress to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Emory T., ''The Confederate Nation: 1861–1865'', 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-090703-7}} Chapter 3. "Foundations of the Southern Nation".&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven states declared their secession from the United States before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. After the Confederate attack on [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] April 12, 1861, and Lincoln's subsequent call for troops on April 15, four more states declared their secession:&lt;ref&gt;Some southern unionists blamed Lincoln's call for troops as the precipitating event for the second wave of secessions. Historian James McPherson argues that such claims have "a self-serving quality" and regards them as misleading. He wrote:
{{quote|As the telegraph chattered reports of the attack on Sumter April 12 and its surrender next day, huge crowds poured into the streets of Richmond, Raleigh, Nashville, and other upper South cities to celebrate this victory over the Yankees. These crowds waved Confederate flags and cheered the glorious cause of southern independence. They demanded that their own states join the cause. Scores of demonstrations took place from April 12 to 14, before Lincoln issued his call for troops. Many conditional unionists were swept along by this powerful tide of southern nationalism; others were cowed into silence.| McPherson p. 278}}
Historian Daniel W. Crofts disagrees with McPherson. Crofts wrote:
{{quote|The bombardment of Fort Sumter, by itself, did not destroy Unionist majorities in the upper South. Because only three days elapsed before Lincoln issued the proclamation, the two events viewed retrospectively, appear almost simultaneous. Nevertheless, close examination of contemporary evidence&amp;nbsp;... shows that the proclamation had a far more decisive impact.|Crofts p. 336}}
Crofts further noted that, {{quote|Many concluded&amp;nbsp;... that Lincoln had deliberately chosen "to drive off all the Slave states, in order to make war on them and annihilate slavery".| Crofts pp. 337–338, quoting the North Carolina politician [[Jonathan Worth (Governor)|Jonathan Worth]] (1802–1869).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] declared neutrality but after Confederate troops moved in, the state government asked for Union troops to drive them out. The splinter Confederate [[Confederate government of Kentucky|state government]] relocated to accompany western Confederate armies and never controlled the state population. By the end of the war, 90,000 Kentuckians had fought on the side of the Union, compared to 35,000 for the Confederate States.&lt;ref name="Why?"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 1, 2015 |author=James W.

In [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], a [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861–63)|constitutional convention]] was approved and delegates elected by voters. The convention rejected secession 89–1 on March 19, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal and Proceedings of the Missouri State Convention Held at Jefferson City and St. Louis, March 1861'', George Knapp &amp; Co., 1861, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The governor maneuvered to take control of the [[St. Louis Arsenal]] and restrict Federal movements. This led to confrontation, and in June Federal forces drove him and the [[Missouri General Assembly|General Assembly]] from Jefferson City. The executive committee of the constitutional convention called the members together in July. The convention declared the state offices vacant, and appointed a Unionist interim state government.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Morrow Violette, ''A History of Missouri'' (1918). pp. 393–395&lt;/ref&gt; The exiled governor called a rump session of the former General Assembly together in [[Neosho, Missouri|Neosho]] and, on October 31, 1861, passed an [[Missouri secession|ordinance of secession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/secessionacts.html|title=Secession Acts of the Thirteen Confederate States|access-date=September 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308171406/http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/secessionacts.html|archive-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigley (2000) p. 43 See also, [http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/misouord.htm Missouri's Ordinance of Secession] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012190940/http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/misouord.htm |date=October 12, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still a matter of debate as to whether a quorum existed for this vote. The Confederate state government was unable to control very much Missouri territory. It had its capital first at Neosho, then at [[Cassville, Missouri|Cassville]], before being driven out of the state. For the remainder of the war, it operated as a government in exile at [[Marshall, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. C.

Neither Kentucky nor Missouri was declared in rebellion in Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The Confederacy recognized the pro-Confederate claimants in both Kentucky (December 10, 1861) and Missouri (November 28, 1861) and laid claim to those states, granting them Congressional representation and adding two stars to the Confederate flag. Voting for the representatives was mostly done by Confederate soldiers from Kentucky and Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilfred Buck Yearns|title=The Confederate Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rV-XNj4eJ3wC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2010|publisher=University of Georgia Press|pages=42–43|isbn=9780820334769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia took two steps toward secession, first by secession convention vote on April 17, 1861, and then by ratification of this by a popular vote conducted on May 23, 1861. A Unionist [[Restored government of Virginia]] also operated. Virginia did not turn over its military to the Confederate States until June 8, 1861.

In Virginia, the populous counties along the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders rejected the Confederacy. Unionists held a [[Wheeling Convention|Convention]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia#Industrialization and anti-secession sentiment|Wheeling]] in June 1861, establishing a "restored government" with a [[Restored government of Virginia|rump legislature]], but sentiment in the region remained deeply divided. In the 50 counties that would make up the state of [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]], voters from 24 counties had voted for disunion in Virginia's May 23 referendum on the ordinance of secession.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Richard Orr, ''A House Divided, A Study of Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860 [[1860 United States presidential election|Presidential election]] "Constitutional Democrat" Breckenridge had outpolled "Constitutional Unionist" Bell in the 50 counties by 1,900 votes, 44% to 42%.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Otis K. and Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia, A History'', Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1993, 2nd edition, p. 112. Another way of looking at the results would note the pro-union candidates winning 56% with Bell 20,997, Douglas 5,742, and Lincoln 1,402 versus Breckenridge 21,908. But the "deeply divided sentiment" point remains.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of scholarly disputes over election procedures and results county by county, altogether they simultaneously supplied over 20,000 soldiers to each side of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/wvcivilwar.html The Civil War in West Virginia]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015135703/http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvcivilwar.html |date=2004-10-15 }} "No other state serves as a better example of this than West Virginia, where there was relatively equal support for the northern and southern causes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Mark A., ''West Virginia and the Civil War, Mountaineers Are Always Free'', History Press, Charleston, South Carolina, 2011, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives for most of the counties were seated in both state legislatures at Wheeling and at Richmond for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Cynthia Miller, ''The General Assembly of Virginia, July 30, 1619 – January 11, 1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members'', Virginia State Library, Richmond, Virginia, 1978, pp. 478–493&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to secede from the Confederacy by some counties in [[East Tennessee]] were checked by martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aotc.net/Marxen.htm |title=Marx and Engels on the American Civil War |publisher=Army of the Cumberland and George H.

Delaware never produced a full regiment for the Confederacy, but neither did it emancipate slaves as did Missouri and West Virginia. District of Columbia citizens made no attempts to secede and through the war years, referendums sponsored by President Lincoln approved systems of compensated emancipation and slave confiscation from "disloyal citizens".&lt;ref&gt;Freedmen &amp; Southern Society Project, [http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm Chronology of Emancipation during the Civil War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011224131/http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm |date=October 11, 2007 }}, University of Maryland.

====Territories====
{{Main|Confederate Arizona|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Elias Boudinot2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elias Cornelius Boudinot|Elias Boudinot]], Cherokee secessionist, Rep. Indian Territory]]

Citizens at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the southern part of [[New Mexico Territory]] formed a secession convention, which voted to join the Confederacy on March 16, 1861, and appointed Dr. [[Lewis S. Owings]] as the new territorial governor. They won the [[First Battle of Mesilla|Battle of Mesilla]] and established a territorial government with Mesilla serving as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy proclaimed the Confederate [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]] on February 14, 1862, north to the [[34th parallel north|34th parallel]]. [[Marcus H. MacWillie]] served in both Confederate Congresses as Arizona's delegate. In 1862 the Confederate [[New Mexico Campaign]] to take the northern half of the U.S. territory failed and the Confederate territorial government in exile relocated to San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Arizona |volume=2 |first=Thomas Edwin |last=Farish |year=1915 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HkUAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Act+to+organize+the+Territory+of+Arizona%22++Jefferson+Davis&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate supporters in the trans-Mississippi west also claimed portions of the [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] after the United States evacuated the federal forts and installations. Over half of the American Indian troops participating in the Civil War from the Indian Territory supported the Confederacy; troops and one general were enlisted from each tribe. On July 12, 1861, the Confederate government signed a treaty with both the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indian nations. After several battles Union armies took control of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Troy Smith. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v059/59.3.smith.html "The Civil War Comes to Indian Territory"], ''Civil War History'' (2013) 59#3 pp. 279–319.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Territory]] never formally joined the Confederacy, but it did receive representation in the Confederate Congress. Many Indians from the Territory were integrated into regular Confederate Army units. After 1863 the tribal governments sent representatives to the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]]: [[Elias Cornelius Boudinot]] representing the [[Cherokee]] and [[Samuel Benton Callahan]] representing the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]. The [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] aligned with the Confederacy. They practiced and supported slavery, opposed abolition, and feared their lands would be seized by the Union. After the war, the Indian territory was disestablished, their black slaves were freed, and the tribes lost some of their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence M. Between Hauptman, ''Two Fires: American Indians in the Civil War'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capitals====
[[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery, Alabama]], served as the capital of the Confederate States of America from February 4 until May 29, 1861, in the [[Alabama State Capitol]]. Six states created the Confederate States of America there on February 8, 1861. The Texas delegation was seated at the time, so it is counted in the "original seven" states of the Confederacy; it had no roll call vote until after its referendum made secession "operative".&lt;ref&gt;The Texas delegation was seated with full voting rights after its statewide referendum of secession on March 2, 1861. It is generally counted as an "original state" of the Confederacy. Four upper south states declared secession following Lincoln's call for volunteers: Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina. "The founders of the Confederacy desired and ideally envisioned a peaceful creation of a new union of all slave-holding states, including the border states of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri." Kentucky and Missouri were seated in December 1861. Kenneth C. Martis, ''The Historical Atlas of the Congresses of the Confederate States of America 1861–1865'' (1994) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Two sessions of the Provisional Congress were held in Montgomery, adjourning May 21.&lt;ref&gt;The sessions of the Provisional Congress were in Montgomery, Alabama, (1) First Session February 4 – March 10, and (2) Second Session April 29 – May 21, 1861. The Capital was moved to Richmond May 30. The (3) Third Session was held July 20 – August 31. The (4) Fourth Session called for September 3 was never held. The (5) Fifth Session was held November 18, 1861 – February 17, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; The Permanent Constitution was adopted there on March 12, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William T Sutherlin Mansion Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|[[William T. Sutherlin]] mansion, [[Danville, Virginia]], temporary residence of Jefferson Davis and dubbed "Last Capitol of the Confederacy"]]

The permanent capital provided for in the Confederate Constitution called for a state cession of a ten-miles square (100 square mile) district to the central government. Atlanta, which had not yet supplanted [[Milledgeville, Georgia#Life in the antebellum capital|Milledgeville]], Georgia, as its state capital, put in a bid noting its central location and rail connections, as did [[Opelika, Alabama]], noting its strategically interior situation, rail connections and nearby deposits of coal and iron.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond, Virginia]], was chosen for the interim capital at the [[Virginia State Capitol]]. The move was used by Vice President Stephens and others to encourage other border states to follow Virginia into the Confederacy. In the political moment it was a show of "defiance and strength". The war for Southern independence was surely to be fought in Virginia, but it also had the largest Southern military-aged white population, with infrastructure, resources, and supplies required to sustain a war. The Davis Administration's policy was that, "It must be held at all hazards."&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 101. Virginia was practically promised as a condition of secession by Vice President Stephens. It had rail connections south along the east coast and into the interior, and laterally west into Tennessee, parallel the U.S. border, a navigable river to the Hampton Roads to menace ocean approaches to Washington DC, trade via the Atlantic Ocean, an interior canal to North Carolina sounds. It was a great storehouse of supplies, food, feed, raw materials, and infrastructure of ports, drydocks, armories and the established Tredegar Iron Works. Nevertheless, Virginia never permanently ceded land for the capital district. A local homeowner donated his home to the City of Richmond for use as the Confederate White House, which was in turn rented to the Confederate government for the Jefferson Davis presidential home and administration offices.&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of Richmond as the new capital took place on May 30, 1861, and the last two sessions of the Provisional Congress were held in the new capital. The Permanent Confederate Congress and President were elected in the states and army camps on November 6, 1861. The First Congress met in four sessions in Richmond from February 18, 1862, to February 17, 1864. The Second Congress met there in two sessions, from May 2, 1864, to March 18, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As war dragged on, Richmond became crowded with training and transfers, logistics and hospitals. Prices rose dramatically despite government efforts at price regulation. A movement in Congress led by [[Henry S. Foote]] of Tennessee argued for moving the capital from Richmond. At the approach of Federal armies in mid-1862, the government's archives were readied for removal. As the [[Overland Campaign|Wilderness Campaign]] progressed, Congress authorized Davis to remove the executive department and call Congress to session elsewhere in 1864 and again in 1865. Shortly before the end of the war, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, planning to relocate farther south. Little came of these plans before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and most of his cabinet fled to [[Danville, Virginia]], which served as their headquarters for eight days.

Support for the Confederacy was perhaps weakest in Texas; Claude Elliott estimates that only a third of the population actively supported the Confederacy. Many Unionists supported the Confederacy after the war began, but many others clung to their Unionism throughout the war, especially in the northern counties, the German districts, and the Mexican areas.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claude |last=Elliott |title=Union Sentiment in Texas 1861–1865 |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |year=1947 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=449–477 |jstor=30237490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ernest Wallace: "This account of a dissatisfied Unionist minority, although historically essential, must be kept in its proper perspective, for throughout the war the overwhelming majority of the people zealously supported the Confederacy&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernest |last=Wallace |title=Texas in Turmoil |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph B.

He characterizes Texas Civil War history as "a morose story of intragovernmental rivalries coupled with wide-ranging disaffection that prevented effective implementation of state wartime policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Baum |title=The Shattering of Texas Unionism: Politics in the Lone Star State during the Civil War Era |publisher=LSU Press |year=1998 |page=83 |isbn=0-8071-2245-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, local officials harassed and murdered Unionists and Germans. In [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke County]], 150 suspected Unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico. Confederate officials hunted down and killed potential draftees who had gone into hiding.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"/&gt;

Civil liberties were of small concern in both the North and South. Lincoln and Davis both took a hard line against dissent. Neely explores how the Confederacy became a virtual police state with guards and patrols all about, and a domestic passport system whereby everyone needed official permission each time they wanted to travel. Over 4,000 suspected Unionists were imprisoned without trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark E.

===Diplomacy===

====United States, a foreign power====
During the four years of its existence under trial by war, the Confederate States of America asserted its independence and appointed dozens of diplomatic agents abroad. None were ever officially recognized by a foreign government. The United States government regarded the Southern states as being in rebellion or insurrection and so refused any formal recognition of their status.

Even before [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] issued formal instructions to the American minister to Britain, [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]]:
{{quote|[Make] no expressions of harshness or disrespect, or even impatience concerning the seceding States, their agents, or their people, [those States] must always continue to be, equal and honored members of this Federal Union, [their citizens] still are and always must be our kindred and countrymen.&lt;ref name=SewardToAdams1861 &gt;William Seward to Charles Francis Adams, April 10, 1861 in Marion Mills Miller, (ed.) ''Life And Works Of Abraham Lincoln'' (1907) Vol 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seward instructed Adams that if the British government seemed inclined to recognize the Confederacy, or even waver in that regard, it was to receive a sharp warning, with a strong hint of war:
{{quote|[if Britain is] tolerating the application of the so-called seceding States, or wavering about it, [they cannot] remain friends with the United States&amp;nbsp;... if they determine to recognize [the Confederacy], [Britain] may at the same time prepare to enter into alliance with the enemies of this republic.&lt;ref name=SewardToAdams1861 /&gt;}}

The United States government never declared war on those "kindred and countrymen" in the Confederacy, but conducted its military efforts beginning with a presidential proclamation issued April 15, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Sandburg|title=Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years and the War Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nL5xCYLFs0C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1940|page=151|isbn=9781402742880}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for troops to recapture forts and suppress what Lincoln later called an "insurrection and rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Lincoln|title=Abraham Lincoln; Complete Works, Comprising His Speeches, State Papers, and Miscellaneous Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX8_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA542|year=1920|publisher=Century|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-war parleys between the two sides occurred without formal political recognition, though the [[laws of war]] predominantly governed military relationships on both sides of uniformed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Violations of the rules of law were precipitated on both sides and can be found in historical accounts of guerrilla war, units in cross-racial combat and captives held in prisoner of war camps, brutal, tragic accounts against both soldiers and civilian populations.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the part of the Confederacy, immediately following Fort Sumter the Confederate Congress proclaimed that "war exists between the Confederate States and the Government of the United States, and the States and Territories thereof". A state of war was not to formally exist between the Confederacy and those states and territories in the United States allowing slavery, although Confederate Rangers were compensated for destruction they could effect there throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rebellion Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKB2AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Moore,%20Frank,%20|last=Moore|first=Frank|volume=I|publisher=G.P. Putnam|year=1861|pages=195–197|isbn=0-405-10877-X}} Doc. 140. The places excepted in the Confederate States proclamation that "a war exists" were the places where slavery was allowed: States of Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, and Delaware, and the Territories of Arizona, and New Mexico, and the Indian Territory south of Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--I find nowhere on these pages, nor anywhere in the volume that the war is given a name--&gt;

Concerning the international status and nationhood of the Confederate States of America, in 1869 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in {{ussc|name=Texas v. White|74|700|1869|Wall.|7|el=no}} ruled Texas' declaration of secession was [[Void (law)|legally null and void]].&lt;ref&gt;

White''], 74 U.S. 700 (1868) at [[Cornell University Law School]] Supreme Court collection.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jefferson Davis]], former President of the Confederacy, and Alexander H. Stephens, its former vice-president, both wrote postwar arguments in favor of secession's legality and the international legitimacy of the Government of the Confederate States of America, most notably Davis' ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]''.

====International diplomacy====
The Confederacy's biggest foreign policy successes were with Spain's Caribbean colonies and Brazil, the "peoples most identical to us in Institutions",&lt;ref name=Spain/&gt; in which slavery remained legal until the 1880s.

After the end of the war, Brazil was the primary destination of those Southerners who wanted to continue living in a slave society, where, as one immigrant remarked, slaves were cheap (see [[Confederados]]).

However, militarily this meant little. Once war with the United States began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes for survival on military intervention by Great Britain and/or [[Second French Empire|France]]. The Confederate government sent [[James M. Mason]] to London and [[John Slidell]] to Paris. On their way to Europe in 1861, the U.S. Navy intercepted their ship, the ''Trent,'' and forcibly detained them in Boston, an international episode known as the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. The diplomats were eventually released and continued their voyage to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Carroll, "The American Civil War and British Intervention: The Threat of Anglo-American Conflict." ''Canadian Journal of History'' (2012) 47#1 pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their diplomacy was unsuccessful; historians give them low marks for their poor diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal (1966) p. 151; Jones (2009) p. 321; Owsley (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page number needed|date=December 2020}} Neither secured [[diplomatic recognition]] for the Confederacy, much less military assistance.

The Confederates who had believed that "[[King Cotton|cotton is king]]", that is, that Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton, proved mistaken. The British had stocks to last over a year and had been developing alternative sources of cotton, most notably [[British Raj|India]] and [[Egypt]]. Britain had so much cotton that it was exporting some to France.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|title=James Murray Mason : defender of the old South|first=Robert W.|last=Young|author-link= Robert W.

Aside from the purely economic questions, there was also the clamorous ethical debate. Great Britain took pride in being a leader in suppressing slavery, ending it in its empire in 1833, and the end of the Atlantic slave trade was enforced by British vessels. Confederate diplomats found little support for American slavery, cotton trade or no. A series of [[slave narratives]] about American slavery was being published in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Slave Narratives, the Romantic Imagination and Transatlantic Literature|first=Helen|last=Thomas|title=The Oxford Handbook of the African American Slave Narrative|editor-first=Johnt|editor-last=Ernest|year=2014|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731480.013.013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in London that the first [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] had been held in 1840; it was followed by regular smaller conferences.

Throughout the early years of the war, British foreign secretary [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], Emperor [[Napoleon III]] of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war.

''American foreign relations: A history, to 1920: Volume 1'' (2009) pp. 149–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to Britain of a war with the U.S. would have been high: the immediate loss of American grain-shipments, the end of British exports to the U.S., and the seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes in Britain, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet. Outright recognition would have meant certain war with the United States; in mid-1862 fears of race war (as had transpired in the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791–1804) led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons. Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] did not lead to interracial violence, let alone a bloodbath, but it did give the friends of the Union strong talking points in the arguments that raged across Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jones, ''Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War'' (2002), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Slidell]], the Confederate States emissary to France, did succeed in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from [[Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger|Erlanger]] and other French capitalists. The money went to buy ironclad warships, as well as military supplies that came in with blockade runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2205869|title = A Confederate Success in Europe: The Erlanger Loan|journal = The Journal of Southern History|volume = 36|issue = 2|pages = 157–188|last1 = Gentry|first1 = Judith Fenner|year = 1970|doi = 10.2307/2205869}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government did allow the construction of [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] in Britain; they were owned and operated by British financiers and ship owners; a few were owned and operated by the Confederacy.

Several European nations maintained diplomats in place who had been appointed to the U.S., but no country appointed any diplomat to the Confederacy. Those nations recognized the Union and Confederate sides as [[belligerent]]s. In 1863 the Confederacy expelled European diplomatic missions for advising their resident subjects to refuse to serve in the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander DeConde, ed. ''Encyclopedia of American foreign policy'' (2001) vol. 1 p. 202 and Stephen R.

Some state governments in northern Mexico negotiated local agreements to cover trade on the Texas border.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Stephen R.

An example of agents working openly occurred in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] in Bermuda, where a Confederate agent openly worked to help blockade runners.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy appointed [[Ambrose Dudley Mann]] as special agent to the Holy See on September 24, 1863. But the [[Holy See]] never released a formal statement supporting or recognizing the Confederacy. In November 1863, Mann met [[Pope Pius IX]] in person and received a letter supposedly addressed "to the Illustrious and Honorable Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America"; Mann had mistranslated the address. In his report to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself, asserting the letter was "a positive recognition of our Government". The letter was indeed used in propaganda, but Confederate Secretary of State [[Judah P. Benjamin]] told Mann it was "a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations" and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The American Catholic Historical Researches|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m7c7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA227|year= 1901|pages= 27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014) pp. 257–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Confederacy was seen internationally as a serious attempt at nationhood, and European governments sent military observers, both official and unofficial, to assess whether there had been a ''de facto'' establishment of independence. These observers included [[Arthur Lyon Fremantle]] of the British [[Coldstream Guards]], who entered the Confederacy via Mexico, Fitzgerald Ross of the Austrian [[Hussars]], and [[Justus Scheibert]] of the [[Prussian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'', pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; European travelers visited and wrote accounts for publication. Importantly in 1862, the Frenchman [[Charles Frédéric Girard|Charles Girard]]'s ''Seven months in the rebel states during the North American War'' testified "this government&amp;nbsp;... is no longer a trial government&amp;nbsp;... but really a normal government, the expression of popular will".&lt;ref&gt;Scholars such as Emory M. Thomas have characterized Girard's book as "more propaganda than anything else, but Girard caught one essential truth", the quote referenced. (Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'', p. 220.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Fremantle went on to write in his book ''Three Months in the Southern States'' that he had
{{quote|not attempted to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the Southern people. Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove of some of their customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but I think no generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds. And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which can never have been surpassed in the history of the world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fremantle |first= Arthur |date= 1864 |title= Three Months in the Southern States|publisher= University of Nebraska Press|page= 124 |isbn= 9781429016667}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

French Emperor Napoleon III assured Confederate diplomat [[John Slidell]] that he would make "direct proposition" to Britain for joint recognition. The Emperor made the same assurance to British Members of Parliament [[John A. Roebuck]] and John A. Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Roebuck in turn publicly prepared a bill to submit to Parliament June 30 supporting joint Anglo-French recognition of the Confederacy. "Southerners had a right to be optimistic, or at least hopeful, that their revolution would prevail, or at least endure."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 219, 220, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the double disasters at Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July 1863, the Confederates "suffered a severe loss of confidence in themselves", and withdrew into an interior defensive position. There would be no help from the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1864, Davis considered sacrificing slavery in order to enlist recognition and aid from Paris and London; he secretly sent [[Duncan F. Kenner]] to Europe with a message that the war was fought solely for "the vindication of our rights to self-government and independence" and that "no sacrifice is too great, save that of honor". The message stated that if the French or British governments made their recognition conditional on anything at all, the Confederacy would consent to such terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A compilation of the messages and papers of the Confederacy: including the diplomatic correspondence, 1861–1865 |url= https://archive.org/details/acompilationmes74richgoog |editor= Richardson, James D. |others= Volume II |publisher= United States Publishing Company |location= Nashville |year= 1905 |page =[https://archive.org/details/acompilationmes74richgoog/page/n715 697] |access-date= March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis's message could not explicitly acknowledge that slavery was on the bargaining table due to still-strong domestic support for slavery among the wealthy and politically influential.

===Confederacy at war===

====Motivations of soldiers====
{{Main|Confederate States Army#Morale and motivations}}
Most young white men voluntarily joined Confederate national or state military units. Perman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:
{{quote|Some historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Michael Perman|editor2=Amy Murrell Taylor|title=Major Problems in the Civil War and Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rPbZT_hrncC&amp;pg=PA178|year= 2010|publisher=Cengage |page=178|isbn=978-0618875207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, ''For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Military strategy====
Civil War historian [[E. Merton Coulter]] wrote that for those who would secure its independence, "The Confederacy was unfortunate in its failure to work out a general strategy for the whole war". Aggressive strategy called for offensive force concentration. Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors. The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination "dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond". The Davis administration considered the war purely defensive, a "simple demand that the people of the United States would cease to war upon us".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 342–343&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[James M. McPherson]] is a critic of Lee's offensive strategy: "Lee pursued a faulty military strategy that ensured Confederate defeat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James M. McPherson Professor of American History Princeton University|title=Drawn with the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War: Reflections on the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KejHFo7A8eQC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1996|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=152|isbn=9780199727834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Confederate government lost control of territory in campaign after campaign, it was said that "the vast size of the Confederacy would make its conquest impossible". The enemy would be struck down by the same elements which so often debilitated or destroyed visitors and transplants in the South. Heat exhaustion, sunstroke, endemic diseases such as malaria and typhoid would match the destructive effectiveness of the Moscow winter on the [[French invasion of Russia|invading armies]] of Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 348. "The enemy could not hold territory, a hostile people would close in behind. The Confederacy still existed wherever there was an army under her unfurled banners."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of the Confederate States of America.svg|thumb|The Seal&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not add the word "Great" as it would be historically inaccurate. The word was not in the 1863 law passed by the C.S. Congress establishing the Seal.

Like Washington's equestrian statue honoring him at [[Union Square (New York City)#Union Square Partnership|Union Square]] NYC 1856, slaveholding Washington is pictured in his uniform of the Revolution securing American independence. While armed, he does not have his sword drawn as he is depicted in the [[Washington Monument (Richmond, Virginia)|equestrian statue at the Virginia Capitol, Richmond, Virginia]]. The plates for the Seal were engraved in England but never received due to the Union Blockade.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Early in the war both sides believed that one great battle would decide the conflict; the Confederates won a surprise victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], also known as [[First Manassas]] (the name used by Confederate forces). It drove the Confederate people "insane with joy"; the public demanded a forward movement to capture Washington, relocate the Confederate capital there, and admit [[Maryland in the Civil War|Maryland]] to the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; A council of war by the victorious Confederate generals decided not to advance against larger numbers of fresh Federal troops in defensive positions. Davis did not countermand it. Following the Confederate incursion into Maryland halted at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in October 1862, generals proposed concentrating forces from state commands to re-invade the north. Nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; Again in mid-1863 at his incursion into Pennsylvania, Lee requested that Davis Beauregard simultaneously attack Washington with troops taken from the Carolinas. But the troops there remained in place during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]].

The eleven states of the Confederacy were outnumbered by the North about four-to-one in white men of military age. It was overmatched far more in military equipment, industrial facilities, railroads for transport, and wagons supplying the front.

Confederates slowed the Yankee invaders, at heavy cost to the Southern infrastructure. The Confederates burned bridges, laid [[Land mine|land mines]] in the roads, and made harbors inlets and inland waterways unusable with sunken mines (called "torpedoes" at the time). Coulter reports:
{{quote|Rangers in twenty to fifty-man units were awarded 50% valuation for property destroyed behind Union lines, regardless of location or loyalty. As Federals occupied the South, objections by loyal Confederate concerning Ranger horse-stealing and indiscriminate scorched earth tactics behind Union lines led to Congress abolishing the Ranger service two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 333–338.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Confederacy relied on external sources for war materials. The first came from trade with the enemy. "Vast amounts of war supplies" came through Kentucky, and thereafter, western armies were "to a very considerable extent" provisioned with illicit trade via Federal agents and northern private traders.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 286. After capture by Federals, [[Memphis, Tennessee#19th century|Memphis]], TN became a major source of supply for Confederate armies, comparable to Nassau and its [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]].&lt;/ref&gt; But that trade was interrupted in the first year of war by [[David Dixon Porter|Admiral Porter]]'s river gunboats as they gained dominance along navigable rivers north–south and east–west.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 306. Confederate units harassed them throughout the war years by laying torpedo mines and loosing barrages from shoreline batteries.&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas blockade running then came to be of "outstanding importance".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287–288. The principal ports on the Atlantic were [[Wilmington, North Carolina in the American Civil War|Wilmington]], North Carolina, [[Charleston, South Carolina#Civil War (1861–1865)|Charleston]], South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia for supplies from Europe via Bermuda and Nassau. On the Gulf were Galveston, Texas and [[New Orleans in the American Civil War|New Orleans]], Louisiana for those from Havana, Cuba and Mexican ports of Tampico and Vera Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, President Davis called on privateer raiders, the "militia of the sea", to wage war on U.S. seaborne commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 296, 304. Two days later Lincoln proclaimed a blockade, declaring them pirates. Davis responded with [[letters of marque]] to protect privateers from outlaw status. Some of the early raiders were converted merchantmen seized in Southern ports at the outbreak of the war&lt;/ref&gt; Despite noteworthy effort, over the course of the war the Confederacy was found unable to match the Union in ships and seamanship, materials and marine construction.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 299–302. The [[Confederate Secret Service#Torpedo Bureau|Torpedo Bureau]] seeded defensive water-borne mines in principal harbors and rivers to compromise the Union naval superiority. These "torpedoes" were said to have caused more loss in U.S. naval ships and transports than by any other cause. Despite a rage for Congressional appropriations and public "subscription ironclads", armored platforms constructed in blockaded ports lacked the requisite marine engines to become ironclad warships. The armored platforms intended to become ironclads were employed instead as floating batteries for port city defense.&lt;/ref&gt;

An inescapable obstacle to success in the warfare of mass armies was the Confederacy's lack of manpower, and sufficient numbers of disciplined, equipped troops in the field at the point of contact with the enemy. During the winter of 1862–63, Lee observed that none of his famous victories had resulted in the destruction of the opposing army. He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done. Lee explained, "More than once have most promising opportunities been lost for want of men to take advantage of them, and victory itself had been made to put on the appearance of defeat, because our diminished and exhausted troops have been unable to renew a successful struggle against fresh numbers of the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Armed forces====
{{Main|Military of the Confederate States of America}}

The military armed forces of the Confederacy comprised three branches: [[Confederate States Army|Army]], [[Confederate States Navy|Navy]] and [[Confederate States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].

The Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] who had resigned their Federal commissions and were appointed to senior positions. Many had served in the [[Mexican–American War]] (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but some such as [[Leonidas Polk]] (who graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] but did not serve in the Army) had little or no experience.

&lt;gallery style="float:right; text-align:center;" perrow="2"&gt;
File:Conf Navy Jack (light blue).svg |{{small|Navy Jack – light blue cross; also square [[Flag terminology|canton]], white [[Flag terminology|fly]]}}
File:North Virginia Third Bunting.svg |{{small|Battle Flag – square}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, some colleges (such as [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] and [[Virginia Military Institute]]) maintained cadet corps that trained Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at [[Drewry's Bluff]], Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862blackCSN.htm|title=1862blackCSN}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.

Most soldiers were white males aged between 16 and 28. The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Glatthaar, ''Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee'' (2011) p. 3, ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1862, the Confederate Army was allowed to disintegrate for two months following expiration of short-term enlistments. Most of those in uniform would not re-enlist following their one-year commitment, so on April 16, 1862, the Confederate Congress enacted the first mass [[conscription]] on the North American continent. (The U.S. Congress followed a year later on March 3, 1863, with the [[Enrollment Act]].) Rather than a universal draft, the initial program was a selective service with physical, religious, professional and industrial exemptions. These were narrowed as the war progressed. Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed. In September 1862 the age limit was increased from 35 to 45 and by February 1864, all men under 18 and over 45 were conscripted to form a reserve for state defense inside state borders. By March 1864, the Superintendent of Conscription reported that all across the Confederacy, every officer in constituted authority, man and woman, "engaged in opposing the enrolling officer in the execution of his duties".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, E. Merton, ''The Confederate States of America: 1861–1865'', op. cit., pp. 313–315, 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred L.

Many thousands of slaves served as personal servants to their owner, or were hired as laborers, cooks, and pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen V. Ash|title=The Black Experience in the Civil War South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6BURiBt340C&amp;pg=PA43|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=43|isbn=9780275985240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for "local defense, not combat".&lt;ref&gt;Rubin p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In early 1865, the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee's and Davis's recommendations, the Congress refused "to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers". No more than two hundred black combat troops were ever raised.&lt;ref&gt;Levine pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Raising troops=====
[[File:To Arms Confederate Enlistment Poster 1862.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Recruitment poster: "Do not wait to be drafted". Under half re-enlisted.]]

The immediate onset of war meant that it was fought by the "Provisional" or "Volunteer Army". State governors resisted concentrating a national effort. Several wanted a strong state army for self-defense. Others feared large "Provisional" armies answering only to Davis.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 308–311. The patchwork recruitment was (a) with and without state militia enrolment, (b) state Governor sponsorship and direct service under Davis, (c) for under six months, one year, three years and the duration of the war. Davis proposed recruitment for some period of years or the duration. Congress and the states equivocated. Governor Brown of Georgia became "the first and most persistent critic" of Confederate centralized military and civil power.&lt;/ref&gt; When filling the Confederate government's call for 100,000 men, another 200,000 were turned away by accepting only those enlisted "for the duration" or twelve-month volunteers who brought their own arms or horses.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt;

It was important to raise troops; it was just as important to provide capable officers to command them. With few exceptions the Confederacy secured excellent general officers. Efficiency in the lower officers was "greater than could have been reasonably expected". As with the Federals, political appointees could be indifferent. Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted. Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 328, 330–332. About 90% of West Pointers in the U.S. Army resigned to join the Confederacy. Notably, of Virginia's West Pointers, not 90% but 70% resigned for the Confederacy. Exemplary officers without military training included [[John B. Gordon]], [[Nathan B. Forrest]], [[J. Johnston Pettigrew|James J. Pettigrew]], [[John Hunt Morgan|John H. Morgan]], [[Turner Ashby]] and [[John S. Mosby]]. Most preliminary officer training was had from Hardee's "Tactics", and thereafter by observation and experience in battle. The Confederacy had no officers training camps or military academies, although early on, cadets of the Virginia Military Institute and other military schools drilled enlisted troops in battlefield evolutions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating the need for more "duration" men, in January 1862 Congress provided for company level recruiters to return home for two months, but their efforts met little success on the heels of Confederate battlefield defeats in February.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 310–311. Early 1862 "dried up the enthusiasm to volunteer" due to the impact of victory's battle casualties, the humiliation of defeats and the dislike of camp life with its monotony, confinement and mortal diseases. Immediately following the great victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]], many believed the war was won and there was no need for more troops. Then the new year brought defeat over February 6–23: [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]], [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]], [[Fort Donelson]], Nashville – the first capital to fall. Among some not yet in uniform, the less victorious "Cause" seemed less glorious.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress allowed for Davis to require numbers of recruits from each governor to supply the volunteer shortfall. States responded by passing their own draft laws.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 312. The government funded parades and newspaper ad campaigns, $2,000,000 for recruitment in Kentucky alone. With a state-enacted draft, Governor Brown with a quota of 12,000 raised 22,000 Georgia militia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The veteran Confederate army of early 1862 was mostly twelve-month volunteers with terms about to expire. Enlisted reorganization elections disintegrated the army for two months. Officers pleaded with the ranks to re-enlist, but a majority did not. Those remaining elected majors and colonels whose performance led to officer review boards in October. The boards caused a "rapid and widespread" thinning out of 1,700 incompetent officers. Troops thereafter would elect only second lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 313, 332. Officially dropping 425 officers by board review in October was followed immediately by 1,300 "resignations". Some officers who resigned then served honorably as enlisted for the duration or until they were made casualties, others resigned and returned home until conscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1862, the popular press suggested the Confederacy required a million men under arms. But veteran soldiers were not re-enlisting, and earlier secessionist volunteers did not reappear to serve in war. One [[Macon, Georgia]], newspaper asked how two million brave fighting men of the South were about to be overcome by four million northerners who were said to be cowards.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Conscription=====
[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|Unionists throughout the Confederate States resisted the 1862 conscription|alt=]]
The Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862. The white males of the Confederate States from 18 to 35 were declared members of the Confederate army for three years, and all men then enlisted were extended to a three-year term. They would serve only in units and under officers of their state. Those under 18 and over 35 could substitute for conscripts, in September those from 35 to 45 became conscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 313–314. Military officers including Joseph E. Johnston and Robert E. Lee, advocated conscription. In the circumstances they persuaded Congressmen and newspaper editors. Some editors advocating conscription in early 1862 later became "savage critics of conscription and of Davis for his enforcement of it: Yancey of Alabama, Rhett of the Charleston 'Mercury', Pollard of the Richmond 'Examiner', and Senator Wigfall of Texas".&lt;/ref&gt; The cry of "rich man's war and a poor man's fight" led Congress to abolish the substitute system altogether in December 1863. All principals benefiting earlier were made eligible for service. By February 1864, the age bracket was made 17 to 50, those under eighteen and over forty-five to be limited to in-state duty.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 313–314, 319. Apart from their respective system exemptions, populations under Federal administration were subject to a "wheel of fortune" draft by aggregate number from each state in each draft, rather than the Confederate's universal selection by age. Overrun areas such as Kentucky and Missouri were not subject to the draft, these areas expanded as the war progressed. The act abolishing the substitute system and nullifying the principal's exemption was challenged in court as a violation of contract, but "no court of importance so held".&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate conscription was not universal; it was a selective service. The First Conscription Act of April 1862 exempted occupations related to transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching and physical fitness. The Second Conscription Act of October 1862 expanded exemptions in industry, agriculture and conscientious objection. Exemption fraud proliferated in medical examinations, army furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 315–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich men's sons were appointed to the socially outcast "overseer" occupation, but the measure was received in the country with "universal odium". The legislative vehicle was the controversial [[Twenty Negro Law]] that specifically exempted one white overseer or owner for every plantation with at least 20 slaves. Backpedalling six months later, Congress provided overseers under 45 could be exempted only if they held the occupation before the first Conscription Act.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 320. One such exemption was allowed for every 20 slaves on a plantation, the May 1863 reform required previous occupation and that the plantation of 20 slaves (or group of plantations within a five-mile area) had not been subdivided after the first exemption of April 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of officials under state exemptions appointed by state Governor patronage expanded significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 317–318. There were no organized political parties, but elective offices were also exempted. Virtually every position was contested with as many as twenty candidates for each office. Some scholars such as Martis interpret this as robust democratic society in wartime. Coulter attributes the widely new found enthusiasm for political careers as a means to "get out of the army or keep from getting into it". State Governor patronage expanded most notably in the tens of thousands in Georgia and North Carolina. In Greene County, Georgia, two dozen men ran for three offices; in protest, the women of the county ran a ticket of three men older than the 45 years conscription age.&lt;/ref&gt; By law, substitutes could not be subject to conscription, but instead of adding to Confederate manpower, unit officers in the field reported that over-50 and under-17-year-old substitutes made up to 90% of the desertions.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Conscription Act of February 1864 "radically changed the whole system" of selection. It abolished industrial exemptions, placing detail authority in President Davis. As the shame of conscription was greater than a felony conviction, the system brought in "about as many volunteers as it did conscripts." Many men in otherwise "bombproof" positions were enlisted in one way or another, nearly 160,000 additional volunteers and conscripts in uniform. Still there was shirking.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 322–324, 326. The Conscription Bureau was run by Brigadier General [[Gabriel J. Rains]] until May 1863, Brigadier General [[Charles W. Field]] until July 1864, Colonel [[John S. Preston]] until "the bitter end". The "odium and disgrace" of conscription led many to volunteer. The Bureau was "undoubtedly very inefficient" as officers were culled from those unwanted for field service. Virginia had 26,000 volunteers to 9,000 conscripts. Governor Vance NC "vigorously supported conscription", uncharacteristically netting 21,343 conscripts to 8,000 volunteers. Necessary railroad positions once demeaned as "blacks only" were in 1864 taken by whites of military age.&lt;/ref&gt; To administer the draft, a Bureau of Conscription was set up to use state officers, as state Governors would allow. It had a checkered career of "contention, opposition and futility". Armies appointed alternative military "recruiters" to bring in the out-of-uniform 17–50-year-old conscripts and deserters. Nearly 3,000 officers were tasked with the job. By late 1864, Lee was calling for more troops. "Our ranks are constantly diminishing by battle and disease, and few recruits are received; the consequences are inevitable." By March 1865 conscription was to be administered by generals of the state reserves calling out men over 45 and under 18 years old. All exemptions were abolished. These regiments were assigned to recruit conscripts ages 17–50, recover deserters, and repel enemy cavalry raids. The service retained men who had lost but one arm or a leg in home guards. Ultimately, conscription was a failure, and its main value was in goading men to volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 323–325, 327. Those governors with constitutional reservations refused to participate in conscription. In Fall 1864, Lee required of Davis a total number of 150,000 to match Grant's numbers, "else I fear a great calamity will befall us". This led to Davis appointing officers such as General Pillow to recruiting positions. As a military recruiting officer, [[Gideon J. Pillow]] for whom [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow]], was named, brought in 25,000 for [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Joseph E. Johnston]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted in the last year of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861–62, seem to have lost faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, "This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed [[libertarianism]]; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment."&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victories: 1861====
The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with a Confederate victory at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Charleston]].

In January, President [[James Buchanan]] had attempted to resupply the garrison with the steamship, ''[[Star of the West]]'', but Confederate artillery drove it away. In March, President Lincoln notified South Carolina Governor [[Francis W. Pickens|Pickens]] that without Confederate resistance to the resupply there would be no military reinforcement without further notice, but Lincoln prepared to force resupply if it were not allowed. Confederate President Davis, in cabinet, decided to seize Fort Sumter before the relief fleet arrived, and on April 12, 1861, General Beauregard forced its surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Alexander H.|author-link=Alexander Stephens|title=A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalview02steprich|format=PDF|volume=2|year=1870|page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalview02steprich/page/36 36]|quote=I maintain that it was inaugurated and begun, though no blow had been struck, when the hostile fleet, styled the 'Relief Squadron', with eleven ships, carrying two hundred and eighty-five guns and two thousand four hundred men, was sent out from New York and Norfolk, with orders from the authorities at Washington, to reinforce Fort Sumter peaceably, if permitted 'but forcibly if they must'&amp;nbsp;...|publisher=Philadelphia, Pa. : National Pub. Co.; Chicago, Ill. : Zeigler, McCurdy}} After the war, Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens maintained that Lincoln's attempt to resupply Sumter was a disguised reinforcement and had provoked the war.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sumter, [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|Lincoln directed states to provide 75,000 troops]] for three months to recapture the Charleston Harbor forts and all other federal property.&lt;ref name=LincolnCallToArms&gt;
[http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolntroops.htm Lincoln's proclamation calling for troops from the remaining states] (bottom of page); Department of War details to States (top).&lt;/ref&gt; This emboldened secessionists in Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina to secede rather than provide troops to march into neighboring Southern states. In May, Federal troops crossed into Confederate territory along the entire border from the Chesapeake Bay to New Mexico. The first battles were Confederate victories at Big Bethel ([[Battle of Big Bethel|Bethel Church, Virginia]]), First Bull Run ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]) in Virginia July and in August, Wilson's Creek ([[Battle of Wilson's Creek|Oak Hills]]) in Missouri. At all three, Confederate forces could not follow up their victory due to inadequate supply and shortages of fresh troops to exploit their successes. Following each battle, Federals maintained a military presence and occupied Washington, DC; Fort Monroe, Virginia; and Springfield, Missouri. Both North and South began training up armies for major fighting the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Union General [[George B. McClellan]]'s forces gained possession of much of northwestern Virginia in mid-1861, concentrating on towns and roads; the interior was too large to control and became the center of guerrilla activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar;cc=moawar;q1=red%20house;rgn=full%20text;idno=waro0005;didno=waro0005;view=image;seq=0580|title= The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies; Series 1|volume= 5|page=56}}4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Otis K. and Stephen W.

Lee]] was defeated at [[Cheat Mountain]] in September and no serious Confederate advance in western Virginia occurred until the next year.

Meanwhile, the Union Navy seized control of much of the Confederate coastline from Virginia to South Carolina. It took over plantations and the abandoned slaves. Federals there began a war-long policy of burning grain supplies up rivers into the interior wherever they could not occupy.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Navy began a blockade of the major southern ports and prepared an invasion of Louisiana to capture New Orleans in early 1862.

====Incursions: 1862====
The victories of 1861 were followed by a series of defeats east and west in early 1862. To restore the Union by military force, the Federal strategy was to (1) secure the Mississippi River, (2) seize or close Confederate ports, and (3) march on Richmond. To secure independence, the Confederate intent was to (1) repel the invader on all fronts, costing him blood and treasure, and (2) carry the war into the North by two offensives in time to affect the mid-term elections.

Much of northwestern Virginia was under Federal control.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, Charles, ''Francis H. Pierpont: Union War Governor of Virginia and Father of West Virginia'', Univ. of North Carolina, 1937, p. 419, note 36. Letter of Adjutant General Henry L. Samuels, August 22, 1862, to Gov. Francis Pierpont listing 22 of 48 counties under sufficient control for soldier recruitment.&lt;br /&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsb&amp;fileName=037/llsb037.db&amp;recNum=1996 ''Congressional Globe,'' 37th Congress, 3rd Session, Senate Bill S.531, February 14, 1863] "A bill supplemental to the act entitled 'An act for the Admission of the State of 'West Virginia' into the Union, and for other purposes' which would include the counties of "Boone, Logan, Wyoming, Mercer, McDowell, Pocahontas, Raleigh, Greenbrier, Monroe, Pendleton, Fayette, Nicholas, and Clay, now in the possession of the so-called confederate government".&lt;/ref&gt;
In February and March, most of Missouri and Kentucky were Union "occupied, consolidated, and used as staging areas for advances further South". Following the repulse of Confederate counter-attack at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], Tennessee, permanent Federal occupation expanded west, south and east.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', p. 27. In the Mississippi River Valley, during the first half of February, central Tennessee's [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] was lost and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]] fell with a small army. By the end of the month, [[Tennessee in the american civil war#Twin Rivers Campaign of 1862|Nashville]], Tennessee was the first conquered Confederate state capital. On April 6–7, Federals turned back the Confederate offensive at the Battle of Shiloh, and three days later [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island Number 10]], controlling the upper Mississippi River, fell to a combined Army and Naval gunboat siege of three weeks.&lt;p&gt;Federal occupation of Confederate territory expanded to include northwestern Arkansas, south down the Mississippi River and east up the Tennessee River. The Confederate River Defense fleet sank two Union ships at [[Battle of Plum Point Bend|Plum Point Bend]] (naval Fort Pillow), but they withdrew and [[Fort Pillow, Tennessee|Fort Pillow]] was captured downriver.&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate forces repositioned south along the Mississippi River to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where at the naval [[Battle of Memphis]], its River Defense Fleet was sunk. Confederates withdrew from northern Mississippi and northern Alabama. [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] was captured April 29 by a combined Army-Navy force under U.S. Admiral [[David Farragut]], and the Confederacy lost control of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It had to concede extensive agricultural resources that had supported the Union's sea-supplied logistics base.&lt;ref name="Martis28"&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Confederates had suffered major reverses everywhere, as of the end of April the Confederacy still controlled territory holding 72% of its population.&lt;ref name="Martis27"&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', p. 27. Federal occupation expanded into northern Virginia, and their control of the Mississippi extended south to Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal forces disrupted Missouri and Arkansas; they had broken through in western Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Louisiana. Along the Confederacy's shores, Union forces had closed ports and made garrisoned lodgments on every coastal Confederate state except Alabama and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 354. Federal sea-based amphibious forces captured [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]], North Carolina along with a large garrison in February. In March, Confederates abandoned forts at [[Amelia Island|Fernandia]] and [[St. Augustine in the American Civil War#Early war|St. Augustine]] Florida, and lost [[Battle of New Berne|New Berne]], North Carolina. In April, [[Capture of New Orleans|New Orleans]] fell and Savannah, Georgia was closed by the [[Battle of Fort Pulaski]]. In May retreating Confederates burned their two pre-war Navy yards at Norfolk and Pensacola. See Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287, 306, 302&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars sometimes assess the Union blockade as ineffectual under international law until the last few months of the war, from the first months it disrupted Confederate privateers, making it "almost impossible to bring their prizes into Confederate ports".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 294, 296–7. Europeans refused to allow captured U.S. shipping to be sold for the privateers 95% share, so through 1862, Confederate privateering disappeared. The CSA Congress authorized a Volunteer Navy to man cruisers the following year.&lt;/ref&gt; British firms developed small fleets of [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade running]] companies, such as [[George Trenholm|John Fraser and Company]], and the Ordnance Department secured its own blockade runners for dedicated munitions cargoes.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 288–291. As many as half the Confederate blockade runners had British nationals serving as officers and crew. Confederate regulations required one-third, then one-half of the cargoes to be munitions, food and medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War fleets of [[Ironclad warship|armored warships]] were deployed for the first time in sustained blockades at sea. After some success against the Union blockade, in March the ironclad [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] was forced into port and burned by Confederates at their retreat. Despite several attempts mounted from their port cities, CSA naval forces were unable to break the Union blockade. Attempts were made by Commodore [[Josiah Tattnall III]]'s ironclads from Savannah in 1862 with the [[USS Atlanta (1861)|CSS ''Atlanta'']].&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287, 306, 302, 306 and [http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org11-2.htm CSS Atlanta, USS Atlanta. Navy Heritage]. In both events, as with the CSS ''Virginia'', the Navy's bravery and fighting skill was compromised in combat by mechanical failure in the engines or steering. The joint combined Army-Navy defense by General [[Robert E. Lee]], and his successor and Commodore [[Josiah Tattnall III]], repelled amphibious assault of Savannah for the duration of the war. Union General [[Tecumseh Sherman]] captured Savannah from the land side in December 1864. The British blockade runner [[USS Atlanta (1861)#As Fingal|''Fingal'']] was purchased and converted to the ironclad [[USS Atlanta (1861)|CSS ''Atlanta'']]. It made two sorties, was captured by Union forces, repaired, and returned to service as the ironclad USS ''Atlanta'' supporting Grant's [[Siege of Petersburg]].&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of the Navy [[Stephen Mallory]] placed his hopes in a European-built ironclad fleet, but they were never realized. On the other hand, four new English-built commerce raiders served the Confederacy, and several fast blockade runners were sold in Confederate ports. They were converted into commerce-raiding cruisers, and manned by their British crews.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 303. French shipyards built four corvettes, and two ironclad rams for the Confederacy, but the American minister prevented their delivery. British firms contracted to build two additional ironclad rams, but under threat from the U.S., the British government bought them for their own navy. Two of the converted blockade runners effectively raided up and down the Atlantic coast until the end of the war.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east, Union forces could not close on Richmond. General McClellan landed his army on the [[Peninsula Campaign|Lower Peninsula]] of Virginia. Lee subsequently ended that threat from the east, then Union General John Pope attacked overland from the north only to be repulsed at Second Bull Run ([[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Manassas]]). Lee's strike north was turned back at Antietam MD, then Union [[Ambrose Burnside|Major General Ambrose Burnside's]] offensive was disastrously ended at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] VA in December. Both armies then turned to winter quarters to recruit and train for the coming spring.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 354–356. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign caused the surprised Confederates to destroy their winter camp to mobilize against the threat to their Capital. They burned "a vast amount of supplies" to keep them from falling into enemy hands.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to seize the initiative, reprovision, protect farms in mid-growing season and influence U.S. Congressional elections, two major Confederate incursions into Union territory had been launched in August and September 1862. Both [[Braxton Bragg]]'s invasion of Kentucky and [[Battle of Antietam|Lee's invasion]] of Maryland were decisively repulsed, leaving Confederates in control of but 63% of its population.&lt;ref name="Martis27"/&gt; Civil War scholar [[Allan Nevins]] argues that 1862 was the strategic [[Ordinary high water mark|high-water mark]] of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Nevin's analysis of the strategic highpoint of Confederate military scope and effectiveness is in contra-distinction to the conventional "last chance" battlefield imagery of the [[High-water mark of the Confederacy]] found at "The Angle" of the Battle of Gettysburg.&lt;/ref&gt; The failures of the two invasions were attributed to the same irrecoverable shortcomings: lack of manpower at the front, lack of supplies including serviceable shoes, and exhaustion after long marches without adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''War for the Union'' (1960) pp. 289–290. Weak national leadership led to disorganized overall direction in contrast to improved organization in Washington. With another 10,000 men Lee and Bragg might have prevailed in the border states, but the local populations did not respond to their pleas to recruit additional soldiers.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September Confederate General [[William W. Loring]] pushed Federal forces from [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston, Virginia]], and the Kanawha Valley in western Virginia, but lacking reinforcements Loring abandoned his position and by November the region was back in Federal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rice |first1=Otis K. |first2=Stephen W. |last2=Brown |title=West Virginia, A History |publisher=Univ. of Kentucky Press |year=1993 |edition=2nd |pages=[https://archive.org/details/westvirginiahist00rice_0/page/134 134–135] |isbn=0-8131-1854-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/westvirginiahist00rice_0/page/134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh23-1.html|title=The Civil War Comes to Charleston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anaconda: 1863–64====
The failed Middle [[Tennessee in the Civil War|Tennessee]] campaign was ended January 2, 1863, at the inconclusive Battle of Stones River ([[Battle of Stones River|Murfreesboro]]), both sides losing the largest percentage of casualties suffered during the war. It was followed by another strategic withdrawal by Confederate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy won a significant victory April 1863, repulsing the Federal advance on Richmond at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], but the Union consolidated positions along the Virginia coast and the Chesapeake Bay.

Without an effective answer to Federal gunboats, river transport and supply, the Confederacy lost the Mississippi River following the capture of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, and [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] in July, ending Southern access to the trans-Mississippi West. July brought short-lived counters, [[Morgan's Raid]] into Ohio and the [[New York City draft riots]]. Robert E. Lee's strike into Pennsylvania was repulsed at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], Pennsylvania despite Pickett's famous charge and other acts of valor. Southern newspapers assessed the campaign as "The Confederates did not gain a victory, neither did the enemy."

September and November left Confederates yielding [[Chattanooga Campaign|Chattanooga]], Tennessee, the gateway to the lower south.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the war fighting was restricted inside the South, resulting in a slow but continuous loss of territory. In early 1864, the Confederacy still controlled 53% of its population, but it withdrew further to reestablish defensive positions. Union offensives continued with [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] to take Savannah and Grant's [[Overland Campaign|Wilderness Campaign]] to encircle Richmond and besiege Lee's army at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Martis28"/&gt;

In April 1863, the C.S. Congress authorized a uniformed Volunteer Navy, many of whom were British.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 297–298. They were required to supply their own ships and equipment, but they received 90% of their captures at auction, 25% of any U.S. warships or transports captured or destroyed.

In December, the [[Battle of Nashville]] ended Confederate operations in the western theater.

Large numbers of families relocated to safer places, usually remote rural areas, bringing along household slaves if they had any. Mary Massey argues these elite exiles introduced an element of defeatism into the southern outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey, ''Refugee Life in the Confederacy'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collapse: 1865====
The first three months of 1865 saw the Federal [[Carolinas Campaign]], devastating a wide swath of the remaining Confederate heartland. The "breadbasket of the Confederacy" in the Great Valley of Virginia was occupied by [[Philip Sheridan]]. The Union Blockade captured [[Fort Fisher]] in North Carolina, and Sherman finally [[Second Battle of Charleston Harbor|took Charleston, South Carolina]], by land attack.&lt;ref name="Martis28"/&gt;

The Confederacy controlled no ports, harbors or navigable rivers. Railroads were captured or had ceased operating. Its major food producing regions had been war-ravaged or occupied. Its administration survived in only three pockets of territory holding only one-third of its population. Its armies were defeated or disbanding. At the February 1865 [[Hampton Roads Conference]] with Lincoln, senior Confederate officials rejected his invitation to restore the Union with compensation for emancipated slaves.&lt;ref name="Martis28"/&gt; The three pockets of unoccupied Confederacy were southern Virginia – North Carolina, central Alabama – Florida, and Texas, the latter two areas less from any notion of resistance than from the disinterest of Federal forces to occupy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foote |first=Shelby |date=1974 |title=The Civil War, a narrative: Vol III |page=967 |quote=Sherman was closing in on Raleigh, whose occupation tomorrow would make it the ninth of the eleven seceded state capitals to feel the tread of the invader.

The Confederacy's last remaining blockade-running port, [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], [[Battle of Wilmington|was lost]]. When the Union broke through Lee's lines at Petersburg, [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]] fell immediately. Lee surrendered a remnant of 50,000 from the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Virginia, on April 9, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 323–325, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Surrender" marked the end of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Japanese ironclad Kōtetsu#American career as CSS Stonewall|CSS ''Stonewall'']] sailed from Europe to break the Union blockade in March; on making Havana, Cuba, it surrendered. Some high officials escaped to Europe, but President Davis was captured May 10; all remaining Confederate land forces surrendered by June 1865. The U.S. Army took control of the Confederate areas without post-surrender insurgency or [[guerrilla warfare]] against them, but peace was subsequently marred by a great deal of local violence, feuding and revenge killings.&lt;ref&gt;The French-built ironclad [[Japanese ironclad Kōtetsu#American career as CSS Stonewall|CSS ''Stonewall'']] had been purchased from Denmark and set sail from Spain in March.

Historian [[Gary Gallagher]] concluded that the Confederacy capitulated in early 1865 because northern armies crushed "organized southern military resistance". The Confederacy's population, soldier and civilian, had suffered material hardship and social disruption. They had expended and extracted a profusion of blood and treasure until collapse; "the end had come".&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson Davis' assessment in 1890 determined, "With the capture of the capital, the dispersion of the civil authorities, the surrender of the armies in the field, and the arrest of the President, the Confederate States of America disappeared&amp;nbsp;... their history henceforth became a part of the history of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jefferson.

===Postwar history===

====Amnesty and treason issue====
{{Main|Pardons for ex-Confederates}}
When the war ended over 14,000 Confederates petitioned President Johnson for a pardon; he was generous in giving them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. T. |last=Dorris |title=Pardoning the Leaders of the Confederacy |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |year=1928 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |jstor=1891664 |doi=10.2307/1891664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He issued a general amnesty to all Confederate participants in the "late Civil War" in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Andrew. [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=72360 "Proclamation 179 – Granting full pardon and amnesty for the offense of treason against the United States during the late Civil War"], December 25, 1868. Accessed July 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed additional Amnesty Acts in May 1866 with restrictions on office holding, and the [[Amnesty Act]] in May 1872 lifting those restrictions. There was a great deal of discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis. There was no consensus in President Johnson's cabinet, and no one was charged with treason. An acquittal of Davis would have been humiliating for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Roy Franklin |last=Nichols |title=United States vs. Jefferson Davis, 1865–1869 |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |year=1926 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=266–284 |jstor=1838262 |doi=10.2307/1838262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was indicted for treason but never tried; he was released from prison on bail in May 1867. The amnesty of December 25, 1868, by President Johnson eliminated any possibility of Jefferson Davis (or anyone else associated with the Confederacy) standing trial for treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jefferson Davis|title=The Papers of Jefferson Davis: June 1865 – December 1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCFFUrkgy60C&amp;pg=PA96|year=2008|publisher=Louisiana State UP|page=96|isbn=9780807133415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, "United States vs. Jefferson Davis, 1865–1869".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Henry Wirz]], the [[commandant]] of a notorious [[prisoner-of-war]] camp near [[Andersonville, Georgia]], was tried and convicted by a military court, and executed on November 10, 1865. The charges against him involved conspiracy and cruelty, not treason.

The U.S. government began a decade-long process known as [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] which attempted to resolve the political and constitutional issues of the Civil War. The priorities were: to guarantee that Confederate nationalism and slavery were ended, to ratify and enforce the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] which outlawed slavery; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] which guaranteed dual U.S. and state citizenship to all native-born residents, regardless of race; and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], which made it illegal to deny the right to vote because of race.&lt;ref&gt;John David Smith, ed. ''Interpreting American History: Reconstruction'' (Kent State University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1877, the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended Reconstruction in the former Confederate states. Federal troops were withdrawn from the South, where conservative white Democrats had already regained political control of state governments, often through extreme violence and fraud to suppress black voting. The prewar South had many rich areas; the war left the entire region economically devastated by military action, ruined infrastructure, and exhausted resources. Still dependent on an agricultural economy and resisting investment in infrastructure, it remained dominated by the planter elite into the next century. Confederate veterans had been temporarily disenfranchised by Reconstruction policy, and Democrat-dominated legislatures passed new constitutions and amendments [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|to now exclude]] most blacks and many poor whites. This exclusion and a weakened Republican Party remained the norm until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The [[Solid South]] of the early 20th century did not achieve national levels of prosperity until long after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=William J.|author-link1 = William J.

====''Texas v. White''====
In ''[[Texas v. White]]'', {{ussc|74|700|1869}} the United States Supreme Court ruled – by a 5–3 majority – that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the Confederate States of America. In this case, the court held that the Constitution did not permit [[United States states|a state]] to unilaterally secede from the United States. Further, that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were "absolutely [[Void (law)|null]]", under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Robert Bruce |title=Legal Cases of the Civil War |year=2003 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=0-8117-0059-3 |pages=155–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This case settled the law that applied to all questions regarding state legislation during the war. Furthermore, it decided one of the "central constitutional questions" of the Civil War: The Union is perpetual and indestructible, as a matter of constitutional law. In declaring that no state could leave the Union, "except through revolution or through consent of the States", it was "explicitly repudiating the position of the Confederate states that the United States was a voluntary compact between sovereign states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuczek |first=Richard |title=Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H80eQweo0V4C&amp;pg=PA649 |chapter=Texas v.

===Theories regarding the Confederacy's demise===

===="Died of states' rights"====
Historian [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]] argued that the Confederacy "died of states' rights".&lt;ref name="Frank L. Owsley 1925"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank L. |last=Owsley |title=State Rights in the Confederacy |location=Chicago |year=1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |title=The Confederate Nation |page=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owsley |title=Local Defense and the Overthrow of the Confederacy |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=1925 |pages=492–525 |jstor=1895910 |doi=10.2307/1895910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government was denied requisitioned soldiers and money by governors and state legislatures because they feared that Richmond would encroach on the rights of the states. Georgia's governor [[Joseph E. Brown|Joseph Brown]] warned of a secret conspiracy by Jefferson Davis to destroy states' rights and individual liberty. The first conscription act in North America authorizing Davis to draft soldiers was said to be the "essence of military despotism".&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) 257. For a detailed criticism of Owsley's argument see {{cite book |first1=Richard E. |last1=Beringer |first2=William N. Jr. |last2=Still |first3=Archer |last3=Jones |first4=Herman |last4=Hattaway |title=Why the South Lost the Civil War |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=1986 |pages=443–57 }} Brown declaimed against Davis Administration policies: "Almost every act of usurpation of power, or of bad faith, has been conceived, brought forth and nurtured in secret session."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book |first=Richard |last=Beringer |display-authors=etal |title=Why the South Lost the Civil War |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=1986 |pages=64–83, 424–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Vice President Alexander H. Stephens feared losing the very form of republican government. Allowing President Davis to threaten "arbitrary arrests" to draft hundreds of governor-appointed "bomb-proof" bureaucrats conferred "more power than the English Parliament had ever bestowed on the king. History proved the dangers of such unchecked authority."&lt;ref name="google258"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rable |year=1994 |url=https://archive.org/details/confederaterepub00geor |url-access=registration |title=The Confederate Republic: A Revolution Against Politics |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/confederaterepub00geor/page/258 258], 259 |isbn=9780807821442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolishment of draft exemptions for newspaper editors was interpreted as an attempt by the Confederate government to muzzle presses, such as the Raleigh NC ''Standard'', to control elections and to suppress the peace meetings there. As Rable concludes, "For Stephens, the essence of patriotism, the heart of the Confederate cause, rested on an unyielding commitment to traditional rights" without considerations of military necessity, pragmatism or compromise.&lt;ref name="google258"/&gt;

In 1863 governor [[Pendleton Murrah]] of Texas determined that state troops were required for defense against Plains Indians and Union forces that might attack from Kansas. He refused to send his soldiers to the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Moretta |title=Pendleton Murrah and States Rights in Civil War Texas |journal=Civil War History |year=1999 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=126–146 |doi=10.1353/cwh.1999.0101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Zebulon Vance]] of North Carolina showed intense opposition to conscription, limiting recruitment success. Vance's faith in states' rights drove him into repeated, stubborn opposition to the Davis administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Albert Burton |last=Moore |title=Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy |year=1924 |page=295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate. "Anti-partyism became an article of political faith."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (2000) p. 462. Rable (1994) pp. 2–3. Rable wrote, "But despite heated arguments and no little friction between the competing political cultures of unity and liberty, antiparty and broader fears about politics in general shaped civic life. These beliefs could obviously not eliminate partisanship or prevent Confederates from holding on to and exploiting old political prejudices.&amp;nbsp;... Even the most bitter foes of the Confederate government, however, refused to form an opposition party, and the Georgia dissidents, to cite the most prominent example, avoided many traditional political activities. Only in North Carolina did there develop anything resembling a party system, and there the central values of the Confederacy's two political cultures had a far more powerful influence on political debate than did organizational maneuvering."&lt;/ref&gt; Without a system of political parties building alternate sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, "negative, carping and petty". The [[1863 Confederate States House of Representatives elections|1863 mid-term elections]] became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, the lack of a functioning two-party system caused "real and direct damage" to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=David Herbert |editor-last=Donald |title=Why the North Won the Civil War |year=1996 |pages=112–113 }} Potter wrote in his contribution to this book, "Where parties do not exist, criticism of the administration is likely to remain purely an individual matter; therefore the tone of the criticism is likely to be negative, carping, and petty, as it certainly was in the Confederacy. But where there are parties, the opposition group is strongly impelled to formulate real alternative policies and to press for the adoption of these policies on a constructive basis.&amp;nbsp;... But the absence of a two-party system meant the absence of any available alternative leadership, and the protest votes which were cast in the [1863 Confederate mid-term] election became more expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction rather than implements of a decision to adopt new and different policies for the Confederacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Died of Davis"====
The enemies of President Davis proposed that the Confederacy "died of Davis". He was unfavorably compared to [[George Washington]] by critics such as [[Edward Alfred Pollard]], editor of the most influential newspaper in the Confederacy, the ''[[Richmond Examiner|Richmond (Virginia) Examiner]]''. E. Merton Coulter summarizes, "The American Revolution had its Washington; the Southern Revolution had its Davis&amp;nbsp;... one succeeded and the other failed." Beyond the early honeymoon period, Davis was never popular. He unwittingly caused much internal dissension from early on. His ill health and temporary bouts of blindness disabled him for days at a time.&lt;ref name="Coulter pp 105-06"&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter, viewed by today's historians as a Confederate apologist,&lt;ref name="Bailey, 2001"&gt;Fred A. Bailey, "E. Merton Coulter," in ''Reading Southern History: Essays on Interpreters and Interpretations'', ed. Glenn Feldman (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Eric Foner, ''Freedom's Lawmakers: A Directory Of Black Officeholders During Reconstruction'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993; Revised, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1996, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Foner, ''Freedom's Lawmakers'', p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Eric Foner, ''Black Legislators'', pp. 119–20, 180&lt;/ref&gt; says Davis was heroic and his will was indomitable. But his "tenacity, determination, and will power" stirred up lasting opposition from enemies that Davis could not shake. He failed to overcome "petty leaders of the states" who made the term "Confederacy" into a label for tyranny and oppression, denying the "[[Flags of the Confederate States of America#First flag: the "Stars and Bars" (1861–1863)|Stars and Bars]]" from becoming a symbol of larger patriotic service and sacrifice. Instead of campaigning to develop nationalism and gain support for his administration, he rarely courted public opinion, assuming an aloofness, "almost like an [[John Adams|Adams]]".&lt;ref name="Coulter pp 105-06" /&gt;

Escott argues that Davis was unable to mobilize Confederate nationalism in support of his government effectively, and especially failed to appeal to the small farmers who comprised the bulk of the population. In addition to the problems caused by states rights, Escott also emphasizes that the widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would speak up when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Escott |title=After Secession: Jefferson Davis and the Failure of Confederate Nationalism |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-8071-1807-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Coulter, Davis was not an efficient administrator as he attended to too many details, protected his friends after their failures were obvious, and spent too much time on military affairs versus his civic responsibilities. Coulter concludes he was not the ideal leader for the Southern Revolution, but he showed "fewer weaknesses than any other" contemporary character available for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 108, 113, 103&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Lee]]'s assessment of Davis as president was, "I knew of none that could have done as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Virginia |url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Davis_Jefferson_1808-1889 |title=Jefferson Davis (1808–1889) |access-date=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitution ===
{{Main|Constitution of the Confederate States}}
{{Wikisource|Constitution of the Confederate States of America}}

The Southern leaders met in Montgomery, Alabama, to write their constitution. Much of the Confederate States Constitution replicated the United States Constitution verbatim, but it contained several explicit protections of the institution of slavery including provisions for the recognition and protection of slavery in any territory of the Confederacy. It maintained the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|ban on international slave-trading]], though it made the ban's application explicit to ''"Negroes of the African race"'' in contrast to the U.S. Constitution's reference to ''"such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit"''. It protected the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|existing internal trade]] of slaves among slaveholding states.

In certain areas, the Confederate Constitution gave greater powers to the states (or curtailed the powers of the central government more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a [[commerce clause]], the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding [[internal improvement]]s in another state. The Confederate Constitution's equivalent to the U.S. Constitution's [[General Welfare clause|general welfare clause]] prohibited [[protective tariff]]s (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of "carry[ing] on the Government of the Confederate States" rather than providing for the "general welfare". State legislatures had the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] and a [[Supremacy Clause]] that essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.

The Confederate Constitution did not specifically include a provision allowing states to secede; the Preamble spoke of each state "acting in its sovereign and independent character" but also of the formation of a "permanent federal government". During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy. The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate Constitution also explicitly denied States the power to bar slaveholders from other parts of the Confederacy from bringing their slaves into any state of the Confederacy or to interfere with the property rights of slave owners traveling between different parts of the Confederacy. In contrast with the secular language of the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution overtly asked God's blessing ("...&amp;nbsp;invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God&amp;nbsp;...").

====Executive====
{{main|President of the Confederate States of America}}

The Montgomery Convention to establish the Confederacy and its executive met on February 4, 1861. Each state as a sovereignty had one vote, with the same delegation size as it held in the U.S. Congress, and generally 41 to 50 members attended.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 22. The Texas delegation had four in the U.S. Congress, seven in the Montgomery Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; Offices were "provisional", limited to a term not to exceed one year. One name was placed in nomination for president, one for vice president. Both were elected unanimously, 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 23. While the Texas delegation was seated, and is counted in the "original seven" states of the Confederacy, its referendum to ratify secession had not taken place, so its delegates did not yet vote on instructions from their state legislature.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jefferson Davis]], President of the Confederacy from 1861 to 1865]]

Jefferson Davis was elected provisional president. His U.S. Senate resignation speech greatly impressed with its clear rationale for secession and his pleading for a peaceful departure from the Union to independence. Although he had made it known that he wanted to be commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies, when elected, he assumed the office of Provisional President. Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election. All were from Georgia, and the various delegations meeting in different places determined two would not do, so Alexander H. Stephens was elected unanimously provisional Vice President, though with some privately held reservations. Stephens was inaugurated February 11, Davis February 18.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis and Stephens were elected president and vice president, unopposed [[Confederate States presidential election, 1861|on November 6, 1861]]. They were inaugurated on February 22, 1862.

Historian and Confederate apologist&lt;ref name="Bailey, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; E. M. Coulter stated, "No president of the U.S. ever had a more difficult task." Washington was inaugurated in peacetime. Lincoln inherited an established government of long standing. The creation of the Confederacy was accomplished by men who saw themselves as fundamentally conservative. Although they referred to their "Revolution", it was in their eyes more a counter-revolution against changes away from their understanding of U.S. founding documents. In Davis' inauguration speech, he explained the Confederacy was not a French-like revolution, but a transfer of rule. The Montgomery Convention had assumed all the laws of the United States until superseded by the Confederate Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Constitution provided for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected to serve a six-year term but without the possibility of re-election. Unlike the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution gave the president the ability to subject a bill to a [[line item veto]], a power also held by some state governors.

The Confederate Congress could overturn either the general or the line item vetoes with the same two-thirds votes required in the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. The only person to serve as president was [[Jefferson Davis]], as the Confederacy was defeated before the completion of his term.

====Legislative====
{{Main|Provisional Confederate States Congress|Confederate States Congress}}
[[File:Confederate congress.jpg|thumb|'''[[Provisional Confederate Congress|Provisional Congress]]''', Montgomery, Alabama]]

The only two "formal, national, functioning, civilian administrative bodies" in the Civil War South were the Jefferson Davis administration and the Confederate Congresses. The Confederacy was begun by the Provisional Congress in Convention at Montgomery, Alabama on February 28, 1861. The Provisional Confederate Congress was a unicameral assembly, each state received one vote.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book| last=Martis |first=Kenneth C. |title=The Historical Atlas of the Congresses of the Confederate States of America: 1861–1865 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |year=1994 |isbn=0-13-389115-1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Confederate Congress was elected and began its first session February 18, 1862. The Permanent Congress for the Confederacy followed the United States forms with a bicameral legislature. The Senate had two per state, twenty-six Senators. The House numbered 106 representatives apportioned by free and slave populations within each state. Two Congresses sat in six sessions until March 18, 1865.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

The political influences of the civilian, soldier vote and appointed representatives reflected divisions of political geography of a diverse South. These in turn changed over time relative to Union occupation and disruption, the war impact on the local economy, and the course of the war. Without political parties, key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln's call for volunteers to retake Federal property. Previous party affiliation played a part in voter selection, predominantly secessionist Democrat or unionist Whig.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of political parties made individual roll call voting all the more important, as the Confederate "freedom of roll-call voting [was] unprecedented in American legislative history."&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues throughout the life of the Confederacy related to (1) suspension of habeas corpus, (2) military concerns such as control of state militia, conscription and exemption, (3) economic and fiscal policy including impressment of slaves, goods and scorched earth, and (4) support of the Jefferson Davis administration in its foreign affairs and negotiating peace.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Confederate Constitution outlined a judicial branch of the government, but the ongoing war and resistance from states-rights advocates, particularly on the question of whether it would have appellate jurisdiction over the state courts, prevented the creation or seating of the "Supreme Court of the Confederate States;" the state courts generally continued to operate as they had done, simply recognizing the Confederate States as the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=821 |title="Legal Materials on the Confederate States of America in the Schaffer Law Library", Albany Law School |publisher=Albanylaw.edu |access-date=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103033519/http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=821 |archive-date=November 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate district courts were authorized by Article III, Section 1, of the Confederate Constitution,&lt;ref name="ReferenceJud"&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a3-s1|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;. Retrieved July 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and President Davis appointed judges within the individual states of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name="Moise, E. Warren 2003"&gt;[Moise, E. Warren, Rebellion in the Temple of Justice (iUniverse 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the same US Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges. Confederate district courts began reopening in early 1861, handling many of the same type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts heard many cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (seized) by Confederate Receivers.

When the matter came before the Confederate court, the property owner could not appear because he was unable to travel across the [[front line]]s between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred.&lt;ref name="Moise, E. Warren 2003" /&gt; Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, US district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/021.html |title=Records of District Courts of the United States, National Archives |publisher=Archives.gov |access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post Office====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When the Confederacy was formed and its seceding states broke from the Union, it was at once confronted with the arduous task of providing its citizens with a mail delivery system, and, in the midst of the [[American Civil War]], the newly formed Confederacy created and established the Confederate Post Office. One of the first undertakings in establishing the Post Office was the appointment of [[John H. Reagan]] to the position of Postmaster General, by [[Jefferson Davis]] in 1861, making him the first Postmaster General of the Confederate Post Office as well as a member of Davis' presidential cabinet. Writing in 1906, historian Walter Flavius McCaleb praised Reagan's "energy and intelligence... in a degree scarcely matched by any of his associates."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Flavius McCaleb, "The Organization of the Post-Office Department of the Confederacy." ''American Historical Review'' 12#1 (1906), pp. 66–74 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1832885 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the war began, the US Post Office still delivered mail from the secessionist states for a brief period of time. Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state's admission into the Confederacy through May 31, 1861, and bearing US postage was still delivered.&lt;ref name="U.S. Postal used in the Confederacy "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;mode=&amp;tid=2040514 |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |title=U.S. Postal Issue Used in the Confederacy (1893)|access-date=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines. Later, mail that crossed lines had to be sent by [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Covers|'Flag of Truce']] and was allowed to pass at only two specific points. Mail sent from the Confederacy to the U.S. was received, opened and inspected at [[Fortress Monroe]] on the Virginia coast before being passed on into the U.S. mail stream. Mail sent from the North to the South passed at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], also in Virginia, where it was also inspected before being sent on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1832885|title = The Organization of the Post-Office Department of the Confederacy|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 12|issue = 1|pages = 66–74|last1 = McCaleb|first1 = Walter Flavius|year = 1906|doi = 10.2307/1832885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

With the chaos of the war, a working postal system was more important than ever for the Confederacy. The Civil War had divided family members and friends and consequently letter writing increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade runners]] who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail in and out of the Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is ''[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|Prisoner of War mail]]'' and ''[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade mail]]'' as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities. The postal history of the Confederacy along with [[:File:Pow cover 19May1865.jpg|surviving Confederate mail]] has helped historians document the various people, places and events that were involved in the American Civil War as it unfolded.&lt;ref name="Confederate States Post Office"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2027888 |title=Confederate States Post Office |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |access-date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties===
The Confederacy actively used the army to arrest people suspected of loyalty to the United States. Historian [[Mark E. Neely, Jr.|Mark Neely]] found 4,108 names of men arrested and estimated a much larger total.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1999) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy arrested pro-Union civilians in the South at about the same rate as the Union arrested pro-Confederate civilians in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1999) p. 172. Neely notes that. "Most surprising of all, the Confederacy at a greater rate than the North arrested persons who held opposition political views at least in part because they held them, despite the Confederacy's vaunted lack of political parties. Such arrests were more common before 1863 while memories of the votes on secession remained fresh."&lt;/ref&gt; Neely argues:

{{quote|The Confederate citizen was not any freer than the Union citizen – and perhaps no less likely to be arrested by military authorities. In fact, the Confederate citizen may have been in some ways less free than his Northern counterpart. For example, freedom to travel within the Confederate states was severely limited by a domestic passport system.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1993) pp. 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Confederate States of America}}

===Slaves===
Across the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection. Patrols were stepped up. The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections. In the invaded areas, insubordination was more the norm than was loyalty to the old master; [[Bell I. Wiley|Bell Wiley]] says, "It was not disloyalty, but the lure of freedom." Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bell Irvin |last=Wiley |title=Southern Negroes, 1861–1865 |year=1938 |pages=21, 66–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], an executive order of the U.S. government on January 1, 1863, changed the legal status of three million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from "slave" to "free". The long-term effect was that the Confederacy could not preserve the institution of slavery, and lost the use of the core element of its plantation labor force. Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation, and became free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Over 200,000 freed slaves were hired by the federal army as teamsters, cooks, launderers and laborers, and eventually as soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha S.

The former slaves never received compensation and, unlike British policy, neither did the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Vorenberg |title=The Emancipation Proclamation: A Brief History with Documents |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Kolchin |title=Reexamining Southern Emancipation in Comparative Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |year=2015 |pages=7–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===
Most whites were subsistence farmers who traded their surpluses locally. The plantations of the South, with white ownership and an enslaved labor force, produced substantial wealth from cash crops. It supplied two-thirds of the world's cotton, which was in high demand for textiles, along with tobacco, sugar, and naval stores (such as [[turpentine]]). These [[raw material]]s were exported to factories in Europe and the Northeast. Planters reinvested their profits in more slaves and fresh land, as cotton and tobacco depleted the soil. There was little manufacturing or mining; shipping was controlled by non-southerners.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Douglas Hurt, ''Agriculture and the Confederacy: Policy, Productivity, and Power in the Civil War South'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The plantations that enslaved over three million black people were the principal source of wealth. Most were concentrated in "[[Black Belt (geological formation)|black belt]]" plantation areas (because few white families in the poor regions owned slaves). For decades, there had been widespread fear of slave revolts. During the war, extra men were assigned to "home guard" patrol duty and governors sought to keep militia units at home for protection. Historian William Barney reports, "no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War." Nevertheless, slaves took the opportunity to enlarge their sphere of independence, and when union forces were nearby, many ran off to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Barney|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6BpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291|year=2011|publisher=Oxford Up|page=291|isbn=9780199878147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA351|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=351|isbn=9781851097746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave labor was applied in industry in a limited way in the Upper South and in a few port cities. One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution. Mass production requires mass markets, and [[Economics of slavery|slaves]] living in small cabins, using self-made tools and outfitted with one suit of work clothes each year of inferior fabric, did not generate consumer demand to sustain local manufactures of any description in the same way as did a mechanized family farm of [[free labor]] in the North. The Southern economy was "pre-capitalist" in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor markets. That labor system as practiced in the American South encompassed paternalism, whether abusive or indulgent, and that meant labor management considerations apart from productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 12–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 85% of both the North and South white populations lived on family farms, both regions were predominantly agricultural, and mid-century industry in both was mostly domestic. But the Southern economy was pre-capitalist in its overwhelming reliance on the agriculture of cash crops to produce wealth, while the great majority of farmers fed themselves and supplied a small local market. Southern cities and industries grew faster than ever before, but the thrust of the rest of the country's exponential growth elsewhere was toward urban industrial development along transportation systems of canals and railroads. The South was following the dominant currents of the American economic mainstream, but at a "great distance" as it lagged in the all-weather modes of transportation that brought cheaper, speedier freight shipment and forged new, expanding inter-regional markets.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

A third count of the pre-capitalist Southern economy relates to the cultural setting. The South and southerners did not adopt a [[work ethic]], nor the habits of thrift that marked the rest of the country. It had access to the tools of capitalism, but it did not adopt its culture. The Southern Cause as a national economy in the Confederacy was grounded in "slavery and race, planters and patricians, plain folk and folk culture, cotton and plantations".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====National production====
[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war; the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union]]
The Confederacy started its existence as an agrarian economy with exports, to a world market, of cotton, and, to a lesser extent, tobacco and [[sugarcane]]. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The cash came from exports but the Southern people spontaneously stopped exports in early 1861 to hasten the impact of "[[King Cotton]]", a failed strategy to coerce international support for the Confederacy through its cotton exports. When the blockade was announced, commercial shipping practically ended (the ships could not get insurance), and only a trickle of supplies came via blockade runners. The cutoff of exports was an economic disaster for the South, rendering useless its most valuable properties, its plantations and their enslaved workers. Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled up everywhere, but most turned to food production. All across the region, the lack of repair and maintenance wasted away the physical assets.

The eleven states had produced $155&amp;nbsp;million in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local grist-mills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and [[naval stores]] such as turpentine. The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control. The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South. Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons. The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots. Shortages were much worse for civilians, and the prices of necessities steadily rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Conn Bryan|title=Confederate Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeZr20kWbiAC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2009|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|pages=105–9|isbn=9780820334998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy adopted a [[tariff]] or tax on imports of 15%, and imposed it on all imports from other countries, including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/tariff/tariff.html Tariff of the Confederate States of America, May 21, 1861].&lt;/ref&gt; The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, and very few people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the North. The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5&amp;nbsp;million in tariff revenue. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The Confederacy underwent an economic revolution by centralization and standardization, but it was too little too late as its economy was systematically strangled by blockade and raids.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Drury, ed. ''American Civil War: Naval &amp; Economic Warfare'' (2003) p. 138. {{ISBN|0-00-716458-0}}. "The Confederacy underwent a government-led industrial revolution during the war, but its economy was slowly strangled."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation systems===
{{Main|Confederate railroads in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Railroad of Confederacy-1861.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|Main railroads of Confederacy, 1861; colors show the different gauges (track width); the top railroad shown in the upper right is the Baltimore and Ohio, which was at all times a Union railroad]]

In peacetime, the South's extensive and connected systems of navigable rivers and coastal access allowed for cheap and easy transportation of agricultural products. The railroad system in the South had developed as a supplement to the navigable rivers to enhance the all-weather shipment of cash crops to market. Railroads tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport and so made supply more dependable, lowered costs and increased profits. In the event of invasion, the vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union. Wherever Union armies invaded, they assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines.

At the onset of the Civil War the South had a rail network disjointed and plagued by changes in [[track gauge]] as well as lack of interchange. Locomotives and freight cars had fixed axles and could not use tracks of different gauges (widths). Railroads of different gauges leading to the same city required all freight to be off-loaded onto wagons for transport to the connecting railroad station, where it had to await freight cars and a [[locomotive#Motive power|locomotive]] before proceeding. Centers requiring off-loading included Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Wilmington and Richmond.&lt;ref name="Trains1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hankey|first1= John P.|year= 2011|title= The Railroad War|journal= Trains|publisher= Kalmbach Publishing Company|volume= 71|issue= 3|pages= 24–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. Because of this design limitation, the relatively primitive railroads of the Confederacy were unable to overcome the Union naval blockade of the South's crucial intra-coastal and river routes.

The Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or encourage its railroads. Southerners' refusal to export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1836241|doi = 10.2307/1836241|title = The Confederate Government and the Railroads|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 794–810|year = 1917|last1 = Ramsdell|first1 = Charles W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service. In the early years of the war the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate a national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.&lt;ref name="Ersatz"&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey. ''Ersatz in the Confederacy'' (1952) p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Railroads came under the ''de facto'' control of the military. In contrast, the U.S. Congress had authorized military administration of Union-controlled railroad and telegraph systems in January 1862, imposed a standard gauge, and built railroads into the South using that gauge. Confederate armies successfully reoccupying territory could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced. The C.S. Congress formally authorized military administration of railroads in February 1865.

In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsdell, "The Confederate Government and the Railroads", pp. 809–810.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horses and mules====
The Confederate army experienced a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Jones, "The Influence of Horse Supply Upon Field Artillery in the American Civil War", ''Journal of Military History'', (April 2010), 74#2 pp. 357–377&lt;/ref&gt; Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of [[glanders]], a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3744026|title = The Great Glanders Epizootic, 1861–1866: A Civil War Legacy|journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 1|pages = 79–97|last1 = Sharrer|first1 = G. Terry|year = 1995|pmid = 11639801}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1863 the invading Union forces had a policy of shooting all the local horses and mules that they did not need, in order to keep them out of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers experienced a growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5&amp;nbsp;million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial instruments===
Both the individual Confederate states and later the Confederate government printed [[Confederate States of America dollar]]s as paper currency in various denominations, with a total face value of $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion. Much of it was signed by Treasurer [[Edward C. Elmore]]. Inflation became rampant as the paper money depreciated and eventually became worthless. The state governments and some localities printed their own paper money, adding to the runaway inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William J. |last=Cooper |title=Jefferson Davis, American |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j05vwNRXi-0C&amp;pg=PA378 |year=2010 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=378 |isbn=9780307772640 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bills still exist, although in recent years counterfeit copies have proliferated.

The Confederate government initially wanted to finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried up and the Confederacy increasingly turned to [[Government debt|issuing debt]] and printing money to pay for war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Richard |last1=Burdekin |first2=Farrokh |last2=Langdana |title=War Finance in the Southern Confederacy, 1861–1865 |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=352–376 |year=1993 |doi=10.1006/exeh.1993.1015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Wright |title=The Language of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aEJZRIxjDAC&amp;pg=PA41 |year=2001 |page=41 |isbn=9781573561358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate government took over the three national mints in its territory: the [[Charlotte Mint]] in North Carolina, the [[Dahlonega Mint]] in Georgia, and the [[New Orleans Mint]] in Louisiana. During 1861 all of these facilities produced small amounts of gold coinage, and the latter half dollars as well. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, all appear to be U.S. issues. However, by comparing slight differences in the dies specialists can distinguish 1861-O half dollars that were minted either under the authority of the U.S. government, the State of Louisiana, or finally the Confederate States. Unlike the gold coins, this issue was produced in significant numbers (over 2.5&amp;nbsp;million) and is inexpensive in lower grades, although fakes have been made for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/seated-liberty-half-dollars-pscid-40/1861-o-50c-ms-coinid-16303|title=1861 O 50C MS Seated Liberty Half Dollars &amp;#124; NGC|website=www.ngccoin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before the New Orleans Mint ceased operation in May, 1861, the Confederate government used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars. This made one of the great rarities of American numismatics. A lack of silver and gold precluded further coinage. The Confederacy apparently also experimented with issuing one cent coins, although only 12 were produced by a jeweler in Philadelphia, who was afraid to send them to the South. Like the half dollars, copies were later made as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgs.com/news/confederate-coinage-a-short-lived-dream|title=Confederate Coinage: A Short-lived Dream|website=PCGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation. U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10, as were British sovereigns, [[Napoléon (coin)|French Napoleons]] and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed rate of exchange. Confederate money was paper and postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 151–153, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food shortages and riots===
{{Main|Southern bread riots}}
[[File:Apr2 richmond riot.jpg|thumb|upright|Richmond bread riot, 1863]]
By mid-1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods. Food that formerly came overland was cut off.

As women were the ones who remained at home, they had to make do with the lack of food and supplies. They cut back on purchases, used old materials, and planted more flax and peas to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee, only okra and chicory substitutes. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour, and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jessica Fordham |last=Kidd |title=Privation and Pride: Life in Blockaded Alabama |journal=Alabama Heritage Magazine |year=2006 |volume=82 |pages=8–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Elizabeth |last=Massey |title=Ersatz in the Confederacy: Shortages and Substitutes on the Southern Homefront |year=1952 |pages=71–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments requested that planters grow less cotton and more food, but most refused. When cotton prices soared in Europe, expectations were that Europe would soon intervene to break the blockade and make them rich, but Europe remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coulter|first=E. Merton|year=1927|title=The Movement for Agricultural Reorganization in the Cotton South during the Civil War|journal=Agricultural History|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–17|jstor=3739261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgia legislature imposed cotton quotas, making it a crime to grow an excess. But food shortages only worsened, especially in the towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. Mildred |last=Thompson |title=Reconstruction In Georgia: Economic, Social, Political 1865–1872 |year=1915 |pages=14–17, 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in urban areas. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1863, the poor women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food, as they were angry at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, and merchants. As wives and widows of soldiers, they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephanie |last=McCurry |title=Bread or Blood! |journal=Civil War Times |year=2011 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=36–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Teresa Crisp |last1=Williams |first2=David |last2=Williams |title='The Women Rising': Cotton, Class, and Confederate Georgia's Rioting Women |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |year=2002 |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=49–83 |jstor=40584640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael B. |last=Chesson |title=Harlots or Heroines?

===Devastation by 1865===
By the end of the war deterioration of the Southern infrastructure was widespread. The number of civilian deaths is unknown. Every Confederate state was affected, but most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, while Texas and Florida saw the least military action. Much of the damage was caused by direct military action, but most was caused by lack of repairs and upkeep, and by deliberately using up resources. Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action. Paul Paskoff calculates that Union military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida). These counties contained 63% of the 1860 white population and 64% of the slaves. By the time the fighting took place, undoubtedly some people had fled to safer areas, so the exact population exposed to war is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul F. |last=Paskoff |title=Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy |journal=Civil War History |year=2008 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=35–62 |doi=10.1353/cwh.2008.0007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The eleven Confederate States in the 1860 United States Census had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated what their actual population was when Union forces arrived. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population. In addition, 45 court houses were burned (out of 830). The South's agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81&amp;nbsp;million; by 1870, there was 40% less, worth just $48&amp;nbsp;million. Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.&lt;ref name="Paskoff, Measures of War"&gt;Paskoff, "Measures of War"&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic losses affected everyone. Banks and insurance companies were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure was about the same whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer at the end of the war than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Paskoff, Measures of War"/&gt;

The rebuilding took years and was hindered by the low price of cotton after the war. Outside investment was essential, especially in railroads. One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Samuel |last=Ezell |title=The South since 1865 |year=1963 |pages=27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|One of the greatest calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were in a state of disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey at one time or another to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes&amp;nbsp;... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and the wear and tear of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration.}}

About 250,000 men never came home, some 30 percent of all white men aged 18 to 40 (as counted in 1860). Widows who were overwhelmed often abandoned their farms and merged into the households of relatives, or even became refugees living in camps with high rates of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Lisa Tendrich |editor-last=Frank |title=Women in the American Civil War |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old South, being an "[[Spinster|old maid]]" was something of an embarrassment to the woman and her family, but after the war, it became almost a norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Drew Gilpin |last=Faust |title=Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War |year=1996 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mothersofinventi00faus/page/139 139–152] |isbn=0-8078-2255-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mothersofinventi00faus/page/139 |publisher=Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women welcomed the freedom of not having to marry.

[[File:Confederate Rebel Flag.svg|thumb|This [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Confederate flag|Confederate Flag]] pattern is the one most often thought of as the Confederate Flag today; it was one of many used by the Confederate armed forces. Variations of this design served as the Battle Flag of the Armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee, and as the Confederate Naval Jack.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}]]

The first official flag of the Confederate States of America – called the "Stars and Bars" – originally had seven stars, representing the first seven states that initially formed the Confederacy. As more states joined, more stars were added, until the total was 13 (two stars were added for the divided states of Kentucky and Missouri). During the First Battle of Bull Run, ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]) it sometimes proved difficult to distinguish the Stars and Bars from the [[Flag of the United States#Historical progression of designs|Union flag]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} To rectify the situation, a separate "Battle Flag" was designed for use by troops in the field. Also known as the "Southern Cross", many variations sprang from the original square configuration.

Although it was never officially adopted by the Confederate government, the popularity of the Southern Cross among both soldiers and the civilian population was a primary reason why it was made the main color feature when a new national flag was adopted in 1863.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} This new standard – known as the "Stainless Banner" – consisted of a lengthened white field area with a Battle Flag [[Canton (flag)|canton]]. This flag too had its problems when used in military operations as, on a windless day, it could easily be mistaken for a flag of truce or surrender. Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted. This final national flag of the Confederacy kept the Battle Flag canton, but shortened the white field and added a vertical red bar to the fly end.

Because of its depiction in the 20th-century and popular media, many people consider the rectangular battle flag with the dark blue bars as being synonymous with "the Confederate Flag", but this flag was never adopted as a Confederate national flag.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The "Confederate Flag" has a color scheme similar to that of the most common Battle Flag design, but is rectangular, not square. The "Confederate Flag" is a highly recognizable symbol of the South in the United States today, and continues to be a controversial icon.

==Geography==
===Region and climate===
The Confederate States of America claimed a total of {{convert|2919|mi|km}} of coastline, thus a large part of its territory lay on the seacoast with level and often sandy or marshy ground. Most of the interior portion consisted of arable farmland, though much was also hilly and mountainous, and the far western territories were deserts. The lower reaches of the [[Mississippi River]] bisected the country, with the western half often referred to as the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]]. The highest point (excluding Arizona and New Mexico) was [[Guadalupe Peak]] in Texas at {{convert|8750|ft|m}}.

[[File:Map of CSA 4.png|center|thumb|upright=2.5|Map of the states and territories claimed by the Confederate States of America]]

'''Climate'''

Much of the area claimed by the Confederate States of America had a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers. The climate and terrain varied from vast [[swamp]]s (such as those in Florida and Louisiana) to semi-arid [[steppe climate|steppes]] and arid [[desert climate|deserts]] west of longitude 100 degrees west. The subtropical climate made winters mild but allowed [[infectious disease]]s to flourish. Consequently, on both sides more soldiers died from disease than were killed in combat,&lt;ref name="StatsWarCost"&gt;Two-thirds of soldiers' deaths occurred due to disease. {{cite web|last=Nofi|first=Al|author-link=Albert Nofi|title=Statistics on the War's Costs|publisher=Louisiana State University|date=June 13, 2001|url=http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711050249/http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archive-date=July 11, 2007|access-date=September 8, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; a fact hardly atypical of pre-World War I conflicts.

==Demographics==
===Population===

The [[1860 United States Census|United States Census of 1860]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html#y1860|title=1860 Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |date=January 7, 2009 |access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a picture of the overall 1860 population for the areas that had joined the Confederacy. Note that the population numbers exclude non-assimilated Indian tribes.

In 1860, the areas that later formed the eleven Confederate states (and including the future West Virginia) had 132,760 (1.46%) free blacks. Males made up 49.2% of the total population and females 50.8% (whites: 48.60% male, 51.40% female; slaves: 50.15% male, 49.85% female; free blacks: 47.43% male, 52.57% female).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 All data for this section taken from the University of Virginia Library, Historical Census Browser, Census Data for Year 1860] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |date=October 11, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural and urban population===
[[File:A Home on the Mississippi.png|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[A Home on the Mississippi]]'', [[Currier and Ives]], 1871]]
The CSA was overwhelmingly rural. Few towns had populations of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;– the typical [[county seat]] had a population of fewer than 500. Cities were rare; of the twenty largest U.S. cities in the 1860 census, only [[New Orleans]] lay in Confederate territory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab09.txt|title=U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1860, Internet Release date: June 15, 1998|access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and the Union captured New Orleans in 1862. Only 13 Confederate-controlled cities ranked among the top 100 U.S. cities in 1860, most of them ports whose economic activities vanished or suffered severely in the [[Union blockade]]. The population of Richmond swelled after it became the Confederate capital, reaching an estimated 128,000 in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Dabney 1990 p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Other Southern cities in the border slave-holding states such as [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Maryland's sympathies|Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C.]], [[West Virginia in the American Civil War#Guerrilla war|Wheeling]], [[Alexandria, Virginia#American Civil War|Alexandria]], [[Louisville in the American Civil War|Louisville]], and [[St. Louis in the American Civil War|St. Louis]] never came under the control of the Confederate government.

The cities of the Confederacy included most prominently in order of size of population:

===Religion===
{{See also|Christian views on slavery}}
[[File:St. John's Episcopal Montgomery Feb 2012 02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. John's Episcopal Church (Montgomery, Alabama)|St. John's Episcopal Church]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The Secession Convention of Southern Churches was held here in 1861.]]
The CSA was overwhelmingly [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall M. Miller, Harry S. Stout, and Charles Reagan, eds. ''Religion and the American Civil War'' (1998) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195121295 excerpt and text search].&lt;/ref&gt; Both free and enslaved populations identified with [[evangelical Protestantism]]. [[Baptists]] and [[Methodists]] together formed majorities of both the white and the slave population (see ''[[Black church]]''). [[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] were fully ensured by Confederate laws. [[Church attendance]] was very high and chaplains played a major role in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Robinson-Durso, "Chaplains in the Confederate Army." ''Journal of  Church and State'' 33 (1991): 747+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large denominations experienced a North–South split in the prewar era on the issue of [[slavery]]. The creation of a new country necessitated independent structures. For example, the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]] split, with much of the new leadership provided by [[Joseph Ruggles Wilson]] (father of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]). In 1861, he organized the meeting that formed the General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church and served as its chief executive for 37 years.&lt;ref&gt;W. Harrison Daniel,  "Southern Presbyterians in the Confederacy." ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 44.3 (1967): 231–255. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23517888 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Baptists and Methodists both broke off from their Northern coreligionists over the slavery issue, forming the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;W. Harrison Daniel,  "The Southern Baptists in the Confederacy." ''Civil War History'' 6.4 (1960): 389–401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Clinton Prim. "Southern Methodism in the Confederacy". ''Methodist history'' 23.4 (1985): 240–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Elites in the southeast favored the [[Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America]], which had reluctantly split from the [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Legare Pennington,  "The Confederate Episcopal Church and the Southern Soldiers." ''Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church'' 17.4 (1948): 356–383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42972008 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Other elites were [[Presbyterians]] belonging to the 1861-founded [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. Catholics included an Irish working class element in coastal cities and an old French element in southern Louisiana. Other insignificant and scattered religious populations included [[Lutherans]], the [[Holiness movement]], other [[Reformed]], other [[Christian fundamentalists]], the [[Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]], the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Adventists]], [[Muslims]], [[Jews]], [[Native American religion|Native American animists]], [[deists]] and [[irreligious]] people.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Gleeson, ''The Green and the Gray: The Irish in the Confederate States of America'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidney J. Romero, "Louisiana Clergy and the Confederate Army". ''Louisiana History'' 2.3 (1961): 277–300. {{jstor|4230621}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern churches met the shortage of Army chaplains by sending missionaries. The Southern Baptists started in 1862 and had a total of 78 missionaries. Presbyterians were even more active with 112 missionaries in January 1865. Other missionaries were funded and supported by the Episcopalians, Methodists, and Lutherans. One result was wave after wave of revivals in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;W. Harrison Daniel, "Southern Protestantism and Army Missions in the Confederacy". ''Mississippi Quarterly'' 17.4 (1964): 179+.&lt;/ref&gt;
