==History==
{{Main|History of Austin, Texas}}
{{see also|Timeline of Austin, Texas}}
Austin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late [[Pleistocene]] (Ice Age) and are linked to the [[Clovis culture]] around 9200 BC (over 11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied [[Gault (archaeological site)|Gault Site]], midway between [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] and [[Fort Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Handbook of Texas Online, "Gault Site" entry | url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bbgya | doi = &lt;!-- Texas+State+History+Association --&gt; | access-date = July 18, 2010| date = June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2020}}

When settlers arrived from Europe, the [[Tonkawa]] tribe inhabited the area. The [[Comanche]]s and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apaches]] were also known to travel through the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Native American tribe was most common in the area? |work=Austin City Connection |publisher=City of Austin |url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/faq5.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120208122803/http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/faq5.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |access-date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish colonists, including the [[Isidro de Espinosa|Espinosa]]-[[Antonio de Olivares|Olivares]]-[[Pedro de Aguirre|Aguirre]] expedition, traveled through the area, though few permanent settlements were created for some time.&lt;ref name="HOT: Hays Co" /&gt; In 1730, three missions from [[East Texas]] were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the Colorado River, in what is now [[Zilker Park]], in Austin.

During the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]].

In 1835–1836, Texans fought and won [[Texas Revolution|independence from Mexico]]. Texas thus became an independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system. After Vice President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] visited the area during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital, then in [[Houston]], be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] (near the present-day [[Congress Avenue Bridge]]). In 1839, the site was chosen to replace [[Houston]] as the capital of the [[Republic of Texas]] and was incorporated under the name "Waterloo". Shortly afterward, the name was changed to Austin in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]], the "Father of Texas" and the republic's first secretary of state. The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austintexas.org/travel_trade/why_austin/historyheritage |title=History Lesson |access-date=July 28, 2008 |publisher=Austin Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a severe lull in economic growth from the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Austin resumed its steady development.

In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for [[Stephen F. Austin]].&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt; Mirabeau B. Lamar, second president of the newly formed Republic of Texas, advised the commissioners to investigate the area named Waterloo, noting the area's hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Patoski, Joe Nick. "It's Just Different Here," ''[[National Trust for Historic Preservation|Preservation]]'', July/August 2010, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo was selected, and "Austin" was chosen as the town's new name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Waterloo, Texas|id=hvw13|retrieved=February 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Galveston Bay]], as well as routes between northern Mexico and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]].&lt;ref name="Erlichman (2006), p. 61." /&gt;

[[File:Austin old capital.png|thumb|Second capitol building in Austin|left]]

[[Edwin Waller]] was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital.&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt; The original site was narrowed to {{convert|640|acres|-1|abbr=on}} that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin's first [[city plan]], commonly known as the [[Waller Plan]], dividing the site into a 14-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held.&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Erlichman (2006), p. 61." /&gt; The Waller Plan designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.

In 1840, a series of conflicts between the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] and the [[Comanche]]s, known as the [[Council House Fight]] and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]], pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Plum Creek, Battle of|id=btp04|retrieved=February 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades.&lt;ref name="HOT:Travis Co" /&gt;

Initially, the new capital thrived but Lamar's political enemy, [[Sam Houston]], used two Mexican army incursions to [[San Antonio]] as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar's decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840, the population had risen to 856, of whom nearly half fled from Austin when Congress recessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Austin Community Inventory Report |url=http://www.imagineaustin.net/inventory-historic.htm |publisher=Austin City Connection |access-date=December 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309084740/http://www.imagineaustin.net/inventory-historic.htm |archive-date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resident [[African American]] population listed in January of this same year was 176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Austin Treasures: First Year Firsts: 1839. |url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/begin/firsts.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020109140428/http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/begin/firsts.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 9, 2002 |publisher=Austin City Connections |access-date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of Austin's proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the [[Archive War]], but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]]. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, [[Anson Jones]], and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government, as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.

In 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Census Office, Department of the Interior |title= Map Showing the Distribution of the Slave Population of the Southern States of the United States |url= http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/FULLFRAMEmap.pdf |access-date= December 13, 2010 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |year= 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession.&lt;ref name="HOT: Bastrop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt; However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces. The African American population of Austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in Texas by [[Union Army|Union]] General [[Gordon Granger]] at Galveston, in an event commemorated as [[Juneteenth]]. Black communities such as [[Wheatville, Austin|Wheatville]], Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville were established, with Clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original post-Civil War settlements founded by former African-American slaves ‒ west of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt; In 1870, blacks made up 36.5% of Austin's population.&lt;ref name="census" /&gt;

In September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of [[Huston–Tillotson University]]) opened its doors. The [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 84. Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-7067-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the [[Texas State Capitol|state capitol building]] was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world.&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt; In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new "[[Moonlight tower|moon towers]]".&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt; The first dam washed away in a flood on April 7, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 107. Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-7067-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s and 1930s, Austin implemented the [[1928 Austin city plan]] through a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure and many of its parks. In addition, the state legislature established the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] (LCRA) that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]]. These projects were enabled in large part because the [[Public Works Administration]] provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt;

During the early twentieth century, a three-way system of social segregation emerged in Austin, with Anglos, African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life, including housing, health care, and education. Many of the municipal improvement programs initiated during this period—such as the construction of new roads, schools, and hospitals—were deliberately designed to institutionalize this system of segregation. Deed restrictions also played an important role in [[residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]. After 1935 most housing deeds prohibited African Americans (and sometimes other nonwhite groups) from using land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tretter |first= Eliot |date= 2016 |title= Shadows of a Sunbelt City - The Environment, Racism, and the Knowledge Economy in Austin |publisher= The University of Georgia Press |page=126 |isbn= 9780820344898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the system of segregated public services, racial segregation increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century, with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Jason (2012). ''Racial Dynamics in Early Twentieth-Century Austin, Texas''. Lexington Books. ISBN/9780739170977&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the destroyed granite dam on the Colorado River was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 111. Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-7067-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that formed Lake McDonald (now called [[Lake Austin]]) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form [[Lake Travis]], a flood-control reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 112. [[Arcadia Publishing]], Chicago, Illinois, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-7067-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the [[Texas Oil Boom]] took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.&lt;ref name="HOT: Austin" /&gt;

After the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas' major metropolitan centers. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Austin's population as 14.5% Hispanic, 11.9% black, and 73.4% non-Hispanic white.&lt;ref name="census" /&gt; In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for [[semiconductor]]s and software. The [[University of Texas at Austin]] emerged as a major university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Austin in Texas |url= http://www.writeonaustin.org/ |publisher= Writeonaustin.com |access-date = April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw Austin's emergence in the national music scene, with local artists such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and iconic music venues such as the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]. Over time, the long-running television program ''Austin City Limits'', its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the [[South by Southwest]] music festival solidified the city's place in the music industry.&lt;ref name="austin history" /&gt;

Austin is located within the middle of a unique, narrow transitional zone between the dry deserts of the American Southwest and the lush, green, more humid regions of the American Southeast. Its climate, topography, and vegetation share characteristics of both. Officially, Austin has a [[humid subtropical climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. This climate is typified by very long and hot summers, short and mild winters, and pleasantly warm spring and fall seasons in-between. Austin averages {{convert|34.32|in|mm|0}} of annual rainfall and it is distributed mostly evenly throughout the year, though spring and fall are the wettest seasons. Sunshine is common during all seasons, with 2,650 hours, or 60.3% of the possible total, of bright sunshine per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usclimatedata.com|title=U.S. Climate Data|work=usclimatedata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin falls in [[USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] 8b (15&amp;nbsp;°F to 20&amp;nbsp;°F) and 9a (20&amp;nbsp;°F to 25&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.plantmaps.com/hardiness-zones-for-austin-texas |title=Austin Texas USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=plantmaps.com plantmaps|access-date=January 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers in Austin are very hot, with average July and August highs frequently reaching the high-90s (34–36&amp;nbsp;°C) or above. Highs reach {{convert|90|F|0}} on 116 days per year, of which 18 days reach {{convert|100|°F|0}}.&lt;ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /&gt; The average daytime high is {{convert|70|F|0}} or warmer between March 6 and November 20, rising to {{convert|80|F|0}} or warmer between April 14 and October 24, and reaching {{convert|90|F|0}} or warmer between May 30 and September 18.&lt;ref name="Austin TX Weather Averages" /&gt; The highest ever recorded temperature was {{convert|112|°F|0}} occurring on September 5, 2000, and August 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ewx/html/wxevent/2000_2001/sep2wx.htm |title=Very hot early september 2000 weather |publisher=National Weather Service |access-date=March 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103083353/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ewx/html/wxevent/2000_2001/sep2wx.htm |archive-date=January 3, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-ties-all-time-high-112-degrees-1802560.html|title=Austin's all-time high: 112 degrees|website=Statesman.com|access-date=January 27, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220022909/http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-ties-all-time-high-112-degrees-1802560.html|archive-date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An uncommon characteristic of Austin's climate is its highly variable humidity, which fluctuates frequently depending on the shifting patterns of air flow and wind direction. It is common for a lengthy series of warm, dry, low-humidity days to be occasionally interrupted by very warm and humid days, and vice versa. Humidity rises with winds from the east or southeast, when the air drifts inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but decreases significantly with winds from the west or southwest, bringing air flowing from [[Chihuahuan Desert]] areas of [[West Texas]] or northern [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /&gt;

Winters in Austin are mild with cool nights, although occasional short-lived bursts of cold weather known as "[[Texas Norther|Blue Norther]]s" can occur. January is the coolest month with an average daytime high of {{convert|61|°F|0}}. The overnight low drops to or below freezing 19 times per year,&lt;ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /&gt; and sinks below {{convert|45|°F|0}} during 88 evenings per year, including most nights between mid-December and mid-February. Lows in the upper 30s also occur commonly during the winter. Conversely, winter months are also capable of occasionally producing warm days. On average, eight days in January reach or exceed {{convert|70|F|0}} and one day reaches {{convert|80|F|0}}.&lt;ref name="Austin TX Weather Averages" /&gt; The lowest ever recorded temperature in the city was {{convert|-2|°F|0}} on January 31, 1949. Roughly every two years Austin experiences an [[ice storm]] that freezes roads over and cripples travel in the city for 24 to 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://austin.about.com/od/weatherenvironment/a/weather.htm |title=Austin Weather &amp; Climate |publisher=About.com |access-date=March 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118231257/http://austin.about.com/od/weatherenvironment/a/weather.htm |archive-date=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Austin received {{convert|0.04|in|mm|0}} of ice on January 24, 2014, there were 278 vehicular collisions.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Asher; Taboada, Melissa B.; Jankowski, Phillip.

Typical of [[Central Texas]], severe weather in Austin is a threat that can strike during any season. However, it is most common during the spring. According to most classifications, Austin lies within the extreme southern periphery of [[Tornado Alley]], although many sources place Austin outside of Tornado Alley altogether.&lt;ref name="Data Foundry: Austin Risk Assessment" /&gt; Consequently, tornadoes strike Austin less frequently than areas farther to the north.&lt;ref name="Data Foundry: Austin Risk Assessment" /&gt; However, severe weather and/or [[supercell|supercell thunderstorms]] can occur multiple times per year, bringing damaging winds, lightning, heavy rain, and occasional flash flooding to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.austintexas.gov/department/flood-safety|title = Austin Flood Safety|access-date = April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deadliest storm to ever strike city limits was the [[1922 Austin twin tornadoes|twin tornadoes storm]] of May 4, 1922, while the deadliest [[tornado outbreak]] to ever strike the metro area was the [[1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak|Central Texas tornado outbreak]] of May 27, 1997.

====2011 drought====
{{main|2011 Southern US drought}}

[[File:2011 Texas Drought.jpg|thumb|The 2011 Texas drought dried up many of central Texas' waterways. This boat was left to sit in the middle of what is normally a branch of [[Lake Travis]], part of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]].]]
From October 2010 through September 2011, both major reporting stations in Austin, Camp Mabry and Bergstrom Int'l, had the least rainfall of a [[water year]] on record, receiving less than a third of normal precipitation.&lt;ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /&gt; This was a result of [[La Niña]] conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean where water was significantly cooler than normal. David Brown, a regional official with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, explained that "these kinds of droughts will have effects that are even more extreme in the future, given a warming and drying regional climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Kate |last= Galbraith |title= Assessing Climate Change in a Drought-Stricken State |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/us/26ttdrought.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= August 26, 2011 |access-date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drought, coupled with exceedingly high temperatures throughout the summer of 2011, caused many wildfires throughout Texas, including notably the [[Bastrop County Complex Fire]] in neighboring Bastrop, TX.

====2018 flooding and water crisis====
In Fall 2018, Austin and surrounding areas received heavy rainfall and [[flash flood]]ing following [[Hurricane Sergio (2018)|Hurricane Sergio]].&lt;ref name="rainfall" /&gt; The [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] opened four [[floodgates]] of the [[Mansfield Dam]] after Lake Travis was recorded at 146% full at 704.3 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austins-lake-travis-level-decreases-for-first-time-this-week-following-recent-floods/269-606274991 |title=Austin's Lake Travis level decreases for first time this week following recent floods |author=Reding, Shawna |work=KVUE |date=October 20, 2018 |access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the October 22 to 29, 2018 the City of Austin issued a mandatory citywide [[boil-water advisory]] after the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]], home to the city's main water supply, became overwhelmed by unprecedented amounts of silt, dirt, and debris that washed in from the [[Llano River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statesman.com/news/20181028/austin-water-drinkable-again-but-keep-usage-low-officials-say |title=Austin water drinkable again, but keep usage low, officials say |author=Mulder, Brandon, Wilson, Mark D. |work=Austin American-Statesman |date=October 28, 2018 |access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin Water, the city's water utility, has the capacity to process up to 300&amp;nbsp;million gallons of water per day, but the elevated level of [[turbidity]] reduced output to only 105&amp;nbsp;million gallons per day since Austin residents consumed an average of 120&amp;nbsp;million gallons of water per day, so the infrastructure was not able to keep up with demand.&lt;ref name="rainfall" /&gt;

=== Homelessness ===
As of 2019, there were 2,255 individuals experiencing homelessness in Travis County. Of those, 1,169 were sheltered and 1,086 were unsheltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.austinecho.org/about-echo/homelessness-in-austin/ |title=Homelessness in Austin |work=Austin ECHO |access-date=January 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2019, the Austin City Council approved $62.7&amp;nbsp;million for programs aimed at homelessness, which includes housing displacement prevention, crisis mitigation, and [[affordable housing]]; the city council also earmarked $500,000 for crisis services and encampment cleanups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2019/oct/17/greg-abbott/how-much-does-city-austin-spend-homeless-person/ |title=How much does the city of Austin spend, per homeless person? |author=Mekelburg, Madlin |work=PolitiFact |date=October 17, 2019 |access-date=January 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, following a federal court ruling on homelessness sleeping in public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/09/04/15-35845.pdf |title=Opinions |date=2018 |website=cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Austin City Council lifted a 25-year-old ban on camping, sitting, or lying down in public unless doing so causes an obstruction.

In May 2021, the camping ban was reinstated after a [[referendum|ballot proposition]] was approved by 57% of voters. The ban introduces penalties for camping, sitting, or lying down on a public sidewalk or sleeping outdoors in or near Downtown Austin or the area around the University of Texas campus. The ordinance would also prohibit solicitation at certain locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/05/01/proposition-b-election-results-austin-homeless-camping-ban/7220579002/ |title=Austin voters choose to bring back homeless camping ban |author=Autullo, Ryan |work=Austin American-Statesman |date=May 1, 2021 |access-date=May 13, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Keep Austin Weird" has been a local [[motto]] for years, featured on bumper stickers and T-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin's eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses.&lt;ref name="weird" /&gt; According to the 2010 book ''[[Weird City]]'' the phrase was begun by a local Austin Community College librarian, Red Wassenich, and his wife, Karen Pavelka, who were concerned about Austin's "rapid descent into commercialism and overdevelopment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Long |first=Joshua |year=2010 |title=Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin, Texas |location= Austin |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292722415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan has been interpreted many ways since its inception, but remains an important symbol for many Austinites who wish to voice concerns over rapid growth and irresponsible development. Austin has a long history of vocal citizen resistance to development projects perceived to degrade the environment, or to threaten the natural and cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Swearingen, W.S.

===City government===
{{See also|List of mayors of Austin, Texas|Austin City Council}}
[[File:AustinTXCityHall.JPG|thumb|Austin City Hall]]

Austin is administered by an 11-member [[city council]] (10 council members elected by geographic district plus a mayor elected at large). The council is accompanied by a hired [[city manager]] under the manager-council system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. A referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012 changed the council composition from six council members plus a mayor elected at large to the current "10+1" district system. November 2014 marked the first election under the new system. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] had forced San Antonio and Dallas to abandon at-large systems before 1987; however, the court could not show a racist pattern in Austin and upheld the city's at-large system during a 1984 lawsuit. In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Greenberger |first= Scott S. |date= April 6, 1997 |title= From the archives: Austin faces ghost of racial history in City Council contest |url= https://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-faces-ghost-racial-history-city-council-contest/RZ8CjQ4DWOnIAPdMYKvy4H/ |newspaper= Austin American-Statesman |access-date= August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement in Austin is provided by the [[Austin Police Department]], except for state government buildings, which are patrolled by the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]]. The University of Texas Police operate from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].

Fire protection within the city limits is provided by the [[Austin Fire Department]], while the surrounding county is divided into twelve geographical areas known as emergency services districts, which are covered by separate regional fire departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atcems.org/home/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010946/http://atcems.org/home/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=41|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency medical services are provided for the whole county by Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austintexas.gov/department/fire|title=Austin Fire Department|website=Austintexas.gov|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austintexas.gov/department/ems|title=Austin Travis-County EMS Department|website=Austintexas.gov|access-date=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin is known as an enclave of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] politics in an otherwise conservative state—so much so, that the city is sometimes sarcastically called the "People's Republic of Austin" by residents of other parts of Texas, and conservatives in the Texas Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/us/counting-vote-scene-austin-jockeying-along-with-partying-hold.html |title=COUNTING THE VOTE: THE SCENE; In Austin, the Jockeying, Along With the Partying, Is on Hold |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Verhovek |first=Sam Howe |date=November 12, 2000 |access-date=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/17/america/Texas-Dem-Rebound.php |title = Texas Democrats look to Obama to help them rebound |last = Welsh-Huggins |first = Andrew |date = July 17, 2008 |access-date = January 7, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090212202924/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/17/america/Texas-Dem-Rebound.php| archive-date = February 12, 2009 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Governor [[Rick Perry]] referred to it as a "blueberry in the tomato soup," meaning it is a Democratic city in a Republican state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rick Perry Booed on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" at SXSW in Austin|url=https://people.com/tv/rick-perry-booed-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-at-sxsw-in-austin/|access-date=January 14, 2021|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970s, central Austin became a stronghold of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], while the suburbs tend to vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Overall, the city is a blend of downtown liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole. The city last went to a Republican candidate in 2000 when former Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]] successfully ran for president. In 2004, the Democrats rebounded strongly as John Kerry enjoyed a 14.0% margin over Bush, who once again won Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm |title=Latest vote, county by county |date=November 16, 2004 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City residents have been supportive of alternative candidates; for example, [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|Ralph Nader]] won 10.4% of the vote in Austin in 2000.

In 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights.

As of 2018, all six of Austin's state legislative districts are held by Democrats.

Travis County was also the only county in Texas to reject Texas Constitutional Amendment Proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin (40% for, 60% against).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf |title = November 8, 2005 Joint Special Elections |publisher = [[Travis County, Texas]] |date = November 8, 2005 |access-date = October 19, 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081028224014/http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf| archive-date = October 28, 2008 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story |title=Austin – the Only Gay Place |last=Nichols |first=Lee |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=November 18, 2005 |access-date=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |title = 79(R) HJR 6 – Enrolled version – Bill Text |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125072148/http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |archive-date = November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the candidates for president in the 2004 race called Austin home. [[Michael Badnarik]], the Libertarian Party candidate, and [[David Cobb (activist)|David Cobb]] of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] both had lived in Austin. During the run up to the election in November, a presidential debate was held at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] student union involving the two candidates. While the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] only invites Democrats and Republicans to participate in televised debates, the debate at UT was open to all presidential candidates. Austin also hosted one of the last presidential debates between [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] during their heated race for the Democratic nomination in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/21/debate.main/index.html |title = Obama, Clinton Agree to Disagree |access-date = June 16, 2009 |work = CNN Politics.com |publisher = CNN | date = February 22, 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090609135224/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/21/debate.main/index.html| archive-date = June 9, 2009 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 presidential election, Travis County, which contains the majority of Austin, voted for [[Hillary Clinton]] (D) by a 38.9-point margin (66.3% to 27.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leip |first=David |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |website=Uselectionatlas.org |access-date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gerrymandering====
A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the [[2003 Texas redistricting]]. Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th District–for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg |date=June 28, 2006 |access-date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental movement====
The distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the current ongoing debate about "sense of place" and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin "sense of place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Environmental City |last = Swearingen, Jr. |first = William |publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] |location = Austin, Texas |isbn = 978-0-292-72181-4 |pages = 18, 19 |url = http://www.utexaspress.com |access-date = July 25, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081015000256/http://www.utexaspress.com/| archive-date=October 15, 2008| url-status = live|date = April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Austin became just one of a few cities in [[Texas]] to ban the sale and use of plastic bags. However, the ban ended in 2018 due to a court ruling that regarded all bag bans in the state to contravene the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Say Goodbye to the Plastic Bag Ban; Texas Supreme Court rules city ordinances can't override state law |first=Chase |last=Hoffberger |newspaper=The Austin Chronicle|date=June 22, 2018 |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2018-06-22/say-goodbye-to-the-plastic-bag-ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2019, [[TomTom]] ranked Austin as having the worst traffic congestion in Texas, as well as 19th nationally and 179th globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ren |first1=Victor |title=Austin has some of the worst traffic congestion in the world, study finds |url=https://www.statesman.com/news/20190611/austin-has-some-of-worst-traffic-congestion-in-world-study-finds |website=Austin American Statesman |date=June 11, 2019 |access-date=June 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highways===
{{See also|List of highways in Travis County, Texas}}
[[File:Pennybacker bridge sunset 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Pennybacker Bridge]] is the signature element of [[Texas Loop 360|Loop 360]] in the [[Texas Hill Country]].]]
Central Austin lies between two major north–south freeways: [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] to the east and the [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Mopac Expressway (Loop 1)]] to the west. [[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 183]] runs from northwest to southeast, and [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]] crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough "box" around central and north-central Austin. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.

[[U.S. Highway 290 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 290]] enters Austin from the east and merges into Interstate 35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of Highway 71, continuing to the west. Highway 290 splits from Highway 71 in southwest Austin, in an interchange known as "The Y." Highway 71 continues to [[Brady, Texas]], and Highway 290 continues west to intersect [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]] near [[Junction, Texas|Junction]]. Interstate 35 continues south through [[San Antonio]] to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] on the Texas-Mexico border. Interstate 35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Fort Worth metro-plex in northern Texas. There are two links to Houston, Texas (Highway 290 and State Highway 71/Interstate 10). Highway 183 leads northwest of Austin toward [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]].

In the mid-1980s, construction was completed on [[State Highway Loop 360 (Texas)|Loop 360]], a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic [[Pennybacker Bridge]], also known as the "360 Bridge," crosses Lake Austin to connect the northern and southern portions of Loop 360.

===Tollways===
[[File:Texas45.jpg|thumb|right|Interchange of [[Interstate 35]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]]]]
[[State Highway 130 (Texas)|State Highway 130]] is a bypass route designed to relieve traffic congestion, starting from Interstate 35 just north of Georgetown and running along a parallel route to the east, where it bypasses [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]], Austin, [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]] and [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]] before ending at [[Interstate 10]] east of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], where drivers could drive {{convert|30|mi|km}} west to return to Interstate 35 in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]] at Austin's southeast corner on [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]]. Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, at which point [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|SR 45]] continues west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete. The final leg opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having a maximum speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for the entire route. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].

[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east–west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened in March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with "Manor Expressway" as nickname.
Despite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_hidethis=no&amp;p_field_label-0=Author&amp;p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&amp;p_field_label-1=title&amp;p_bool_label-1=AND&amp;s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B–1 | access-date = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
[[File:AUSCentralConcourse.JPG|thumb|The Barbara Jordan Terminal at [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]]]]
Austin's airport is [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city. The airport is on the site of the former [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], which was closed in 1993 as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process. Previously, [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] was the commercial airport of Austin. [[Austin Executive Airport]] serves the general aviation coming into the city, as well as other smaller airports outside of the city center.

===Intercity bus service===
[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Austin Station at 916 East Koenig Lane, just east of Airport Boulevard and adjacent to [[Highland Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=680174 Austin, Texas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122224330/http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=680174 |date=November 22, 2008}}."

===Intercity rail service===
An [[Amtrak]] ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' [[Austin (Amtrak station)|station]] is located in west downtown. Railway segments between Austin and San Antonio have been evaluated for a proposed regional passenger rail project called "Lone Star Rail". However, failure to come to an agreement with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], the tracks' current owner, ended the project in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=CAMPO Vote Derails Lone Star Rail Project|newspaper=[[KUT]]|date=October 18, 2016|first1=Jimmy|last1=Maas|first2=Ben|last2=Philpott|url=http://kut.org/post/campo-vote-derails-lone-star-rail-project|access-date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transportation===
{{See also|Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority}}
[[File:Austin Metrorail.jpg|thumb|[[Capital MetroRail]] train at [[Downtown station (Capital MetroRail)|Downtown Station]]]]

The [[Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ("Capital Metro") provides public transportation to the city, primarily by bus. Some heavily utilized routes feature articulated buses.

Capital Metro opened a {{convert|32|mi|km|adj=on}} [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system known as [[Capital MetroRail]] on March 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail-qa.shtml |title=All Systems Go Long-Range Transit Plan |publisher=Capital Metro |access-date=April 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303163125/http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail-qa.shtml |archive-date=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system operates on existing freight rail lines and serves downtown Austin, East Austin, North Central Austin, Northwest Austin, and Leander in its first phase. Future expansion could include a line to Manor and another to Round Rock.

Capital Metro has also explored building a [[light rail]] system to connect the MetroRail line to key destinations in Central Austin. On August 7, 2014, the Austin City Council unanimously voted to place a $600&amp;nbsp;million light rail bond proposal on the November 4, 2014 ballot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impactnews.com/austin-metro/central-austin/austin-city-council-puts-road-and-rail-bond-on-ballot/ |title=Austin City Council puts rail bond on ballot |work=Community Impact Newspaper |access-date=September 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203357/http://impactnews.com/austin-metro/central-austin/austin-city-council-puts-road-and-rail-bond-on-ballot/ |archive-date=August 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ballot measure was voted down. Capital Metro returned in 2020 with a major transit expansion plan called Project Connect, which was comfortably passed by voters on the November 2020 ballot. At a total project cost of $10 billion, the Project Connect system plan proposes 3 new light rail lines, 1 new commuter rail line, several new MetroRapid lines, more park-and-rides, more express bus routes, and improvements to the existing local bus system and fare technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ProjectConnect|url=https://capmetro.org/projectconnect/|access-date=August 13, 2020|website=capmetro.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capital Area Rural Transportation System]] connects Austin with outlying suburbs.

In Summer 2018, Capital Metro began testing [[autonomous vehicle|autonomous]] [[electric vehicle|electric shuttles]] on Downtown streets. The pilot program tested two driverless bus models from [[EasyMile]] and [[Navya SAS|Navya]] on a route from the Austin Convention Center to the Austin Central Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://austin.curbed.com/2018/6/26/17506930/driverless-buses-austin-pilot-program |title=Driverless shuttle pilot program coming to downtown Austin |author=Widner, Cindy |work=Curbed |date=June 26, 2018 |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capital Metro is also considering implementing full-size driverless buses, likely to be included on a 2020 transportation referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/capital-metro-to-consider-self-driving-buses/269-595975993 |title=Capital Metro to consider self-driving buses |author=Trejo, Rebecca |publisher=KVUE |date=September 18, 2018 |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
