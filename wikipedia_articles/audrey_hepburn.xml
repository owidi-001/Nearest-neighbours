'''Audrey Hepburn''' (born '''Audrey Kathleen Ruston'''; 4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a British{{efn|She solely held British nationality, since at the time of her birth Dutch women were not permitted to pass on their nationality to their children; the Dutch law did not change in this regard until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loss of Dutch nationality ex lege: EU law, gender and multiple nationality |url=http://globalcit.eu/loss-of-dutch-nationality-ex-lege-eu-law-gender-and-multiple-nationality/|date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further reference is her birth certificate which clearly states British nationality.

Furthermore, she spent a significant number of her formative years in the Netherlands, and was able to speak Dutch fluently. Her ancestry is covered in the "[[#Early life|Early life]]" and "[[#Ancestors|Ancestors]]" sections.}} actress and humanitarian. Recognised as both a film and fashion icon, she was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|third-greatest female screen legend]] from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], and was inducted into the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame.

Born in [[Ixelles]], [[Brussels]], Hepburn spent parts of her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands. She studied ballet with [[Sonia Gaskell]] in Amsterdam beginning in 1945 and with [[Marie Rambert]] in London starting in 1948. She began performing as a chorus girl in [[West End theatre|West End]] musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in several films. Hepburn starred in the 1951 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Gigi (play)|Gigi]]'' after being spotted by the French novelist [[Colette]], on whose work the play was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/180286/history-lesson-learn-how-colette-audrey-hepburn-leslie-caron-vanessa-hudgens-transformed-gigi/|title=History Lesson!

She rose to stardom in the romantic comedy ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953) alongside [[Gregory Peck]], for which she was the first actress to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]], and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for a single performance. That same year, Hepburn won a [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play|Best Lead Actress in a Play]] for her performance in ''[[Ondine (play)|Ondine]]''. She went on to star in a number of successful films such as ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), in which [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[William Holden]] compete for her affection; ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957) a musical in which she sang her own song parts; the drama ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959); the romantic comedy ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961); the thriller-romance ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963), opposite [[Cary Grant]]; and the musical ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964). In 1967, she starred in the thriller ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'', receiving Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations. After that, she only occasionally appeared in films, one being ''[[Robin and Marian]]'' (1976) with [[Sean Connery]].  Her last recorded performances were in the 1990 documentary television series ''[[Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn]]''.

Hepburn won three BAFTA Awards for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role#Superlatives|Best British Actress in a Leading Role]]. In recognition of her film career, she received BAFTA's Lifetime Achievement Award, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]], the [[Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award]], and the [[Special Tony Award]]. She remains one of only 16 people who have won [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards]].

Later in life, Hepburn devoted much of her time to [[UNICEF]], to which she had contributed since 1954. Then, she worked in some of the poorest communities of Africa, South America, and Asia between 1988 and 1992. In December 1992, she received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in recognition of her work as a [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]]. A month later, she died of [[Appendix cancer|appendiceal cancer]] at her home in [[Switzerland]] at the age of 63.

==Early life==

===1929–1938: Family and early childhood===
Audrey Kathleen Ruston (later, Hepburn-Ruston{{Sfn|Walker|1997|p=9}}) was born on 4 May 1929 at number 48 Rue Keyenveld in [[Ixelles]], [[Brussels]], Belgium.{{sfn|Spoto|2006|p=10}} She was known to her family as ''Adriaantje''.{{sfn|Matzen|2019|p=11}}
[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 60038552 Een gezelschap met gouverneur Van Hee.jpg|thumb|Hepburn's grandfather, [[Aarnoud van Heemstra]], was the governor of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colony of [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Guiana]].]]
Hepburn's mother, Baroness [[Ella van Heemstra]] (12 June 1900&amp;nbsp;– 26 August 1984), was a Dutch noblewoman. Ella was the daughter of Baron [[Aarnoud van Heemstra]], who served as mayor of [[Arnhem]] from 1910 to 1920 and as governor of [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Suriname]] from 1921 to 1928, and Baroness Elbrig Willemine Henriette van Asbeck (1873–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Segers |first=Yop |title=Heemstra, Aarnoud Jan Anne Aleid baron van (1871–1957) |url=http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/heemstra |website=Historici.nl |access-date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of nineteen, Ella had married [[Jonkheer]] Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, an oil executive based in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]], where they subsequently lived.{{sfn|Paris|2001}} They had two sons, Jonkheer Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (1920–1979) and Jonkheer Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford (1924–2010), before divorcing in 1925.{{sfn|Spoto|2006|p=3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ian van Ufford Quarles Obituary |work=[[The Times]] |date=29 May 2010 |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?pid=143195604 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621153210/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?pid=143195604 |archive-date=21 June 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn's father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (21 November 1889&amp;nbsp;– 16 October 1980), was a British subject born in [[Úžice (Mělník District)|Auschitz]], Bohemia, Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name="Oxford Bio"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/52107 "Hepburn, Audrey".

This was corrected in 1952 by her mother to "born in Onzic, Bohemia". Onzic is a misreading of Ouzic (German ''Auschiz''), now Úžice in Czech Republic.}} He was the son of Victor John George Ruston, of British and Austrian background{{Sfn|Walker|1997|p=6}} and Anna Wels, who was of Austrian origin and born in [[Kovarce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anna Juliana Franziska Karolina Wels, born in Slovakia |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/celebrities/hepburnaudrey.html |publisher=Pitt.edu |access-date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923–1924, Joseph had been an Honorary British Consul in [[Semarang]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]],{{Sfn|Walker|1997|pp=7–8}} and prior to his marriage to Hepburn's mother, he had been married to Cornelia Bisschop, a Dutch heiress.&lt;ref name="Oxford Bio" /&gt;{{sfn|Spoto|2006|p=3}} Although born with the surname Ruston, he later [[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]] his name to the more "aristocratic" Hepburn-Ruston, perhaps at Ella's insistence,{{sfn|Matzen|2019|p=10}} as he mistakenly believed himself descended from [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|James Hepburn]], third husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].{{Sfn|Walker|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Spoto|2006|p=3}}

Hepburn's parents were married in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]], in September 1926.{{sfn|Paris|2001}} At the time, Ruston worked for a trading company, but soon after the marriage, the couple moved to Europe, where he began working for a loan company; reportedly tin merchants MacLaine, Watson and Company in London.{{sfn|Matzen|2019|p=11}} After a year in London, they moved to Brussels, where he had been assigned to open a branch office.{{sfn|Paris|2001}}{{Sfn|Gitlin|2009|p=3}} After three years spent travelling between Brussels, Arnhem, [[The Hague]] and London, the family settled in the suburban Brussels municipality of [[Linkebeek]] in 1932.{{sfn|Paris|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=vrijdag 6 mei 2011, 07u26 |url=http://www.brusselnieuws.be/cultuur/de-vijf-hoeken-van-de-wereld-amerika-elsene |title=De vijf hoeken van de wereld: Amerika in Elsene |publisher=brusselnieuws.be |access-date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn's early childhood was sheltered and privileged.{{sfn|Paris|2001}} As a result of her multinational background and travelling with her family due to her father's job,{{Sfn|Walker|1997|p=8}}{{efn|Walker writes that it is unclear for what kind of company he worked; he was listed as a "financial adviser" in a Dutch business directory, and the family often travelled among the three countries.{{Sfn|Walker|1997|p=8}}}} she learned six languages: Dutch and English from her parents, and later varying degrees of French, German, Spanish, and Italian.

In the mid-1930s, Hepburn's parents recruited and collected donations for the [[British Union of Fascists]].{{sfn|Spoto|2007|p=8}} Joseph left the family abruptly in 1935 after a "scene" in Brussels when Adriaantje (as she was known in the family) was six; later she often spoke of the effect on a child of being "dumped" as "children need two parents".{{sfn|Matzen|2019|pp=11, 15–17}} Joseph moved to London, where he became more deeply involved in Fascist activity and never visited his daughter abroad.{{sfn|Walker|1997|pp=15–16}} Hepburn later professed that her father's departure was "the most traumatic event of my life".{{sfn|Paris|2001}}{{Sfn|Walker|1997|p=14}}

That same year, her mother moved with Hepburn to her family's estate in Arnhem; her half-brothers Alex and Ian (then 15 and 11) were sent to The Hague to live with relatives. Joseph wanted her to be educated in England,{{sfn|Matzen|2019|pp=16–18}} so in 1937, Hepburn was sent to live in [[Kent]], England, where she, known as Audrey Ruston or "Little Audrey", was educated at a small [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in [[Elham, Kent|Elham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elham.co.uk/Famous_People.htm|title=Famous and Notable People 'In and Around' the Elham Valley|publisher=Elham.co.uk|access-date=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Walker|1997|pp=17–19}}

===1939–1945: Experiences during World War II===
{{see also|Dutch famine of 1944–45}}
After Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn's mother moved her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during the [[First World War]], the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack. While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945. She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her "star pupil".{{sfn|Paris|2001}} After the Germans [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] in 1940, Hepburn used the name&lt;!--her baptismal name and her mother's surname; hardly a pseudonym--&gt; Edda van Heemstra, because an "English-sounding" name was considered dangerous during the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation]]. Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that "had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it might be over next week… six months… next year… that's how we got through".{{sfn|Paris|2001}} In 1942, her uncle, Otto van [[Limburg Stirum]] (husband of her mother's older sister, Miesje), was executed in retaliation for an act of sabotage by the resistance movement; while he had not been involved in the act, he was targeted due to his family's prominence in Dutch society.{{sfn|Paris|2001}} Hepburn's half-brother Ian was deported to Berlin to work in a German [[Arbeitslager|labour camp]], and her other half-brother Alex went into hiding to avoid the same fate.{{sfn|Paris|2001}}

After her uncle's death, Hepburn, Ella and Miesje left Arnhem to live with her grandfather, Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra,&lt;!--again, is the honorific needed?--&gt; in nearby [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]].{{sfn|Paris|2001}} Around that time Hepburn performed silent dance performances to raise money for the Dutch resistance effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/couture-pearls-breakfast-tiffanys-script-inside-private-collection/|title=Couture, pearls and a Breakfast at Tiffany's script: inside the private collection of Audrey Hepburn|last=Cronin|first=Emily|date=20 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was long believed that she participated in the [[Dutch resistance]] itself,{{sfn|Paris|2001}} but in 2016 the [[Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein']] reported that after extensive research it had not found any evidence of such activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/2143538-mythe-ontkracht-audrey-hepburn-werkte-niet-voor-het-verzet.html Mythe ontkracht: Audrey Hepburn werkte niet voor het verzet], NOS.nl, 17 November 2016 {{in lang|nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2019 book by author Robert Matzen provided evidence that she had supported the resistance by giving "underground concerts" to raise money, delivering the underground newspaper, and taking messages and food to downed Allied flyers hiding in the woodlands north of Velp. She also volunteered at a hospital that was the centre of resistance activities in Velp, and her family temporarily hid a paratrooper in their home during the [[Battle of Arnhem]].{{sfn|Matzen|2019|pp=146, 148, 149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/audrey-hepburn-reportedly-helped-resist-nazis-in-holland-during-wwii|title=Audrey Hepburn reportedly helped resist Nazis in Holland during WWII|last=Johnson|first=Richard|date=29 October 2018|work=Fox News|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other traumatic events, she witnessed the transportation of Dutch Jews to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], later stating that "more than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on the train. I was a child observing a child."{{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=36}}

After the Allied landing on [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]], living conditions grew worse, and Arnhem was subsequently heavily damaged during [[Operation Market Garden]]. During the [[Dutch famine of 1944|Dutch famine]] that followed in the winter of 1944, the Germans blocked the resupply routes of the Dutch people's already limited food and fuel supplies as retaliation for railway strikes that were held to hinder German occupation. Like others, Hepburn's family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits;&lt;ref name="CBSsundaymorning"&gt;{{cite news |first=Martha |last=Tichner |title=Audrey Hepburn |publisher=CBS Sunday Morning |date=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesobit"&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Caryn |year=1993 |url=https://nytimes.com/specials/magazine4/articles/hepburn1.html |title=Audrey Hepburn, actress, Is Dead at 63 |work=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118162914/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine4/articles/hepburn1.html |archive-date=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; she developed acute [[anaemia]], respiratory problems and [[oedema]] as a result of [[malnutrition]].{{sfn|Woodward|2012|pp=45–46}} The Van Heemstra family was also seriously financially affected by the occupation, during which many of their properties, including their principal estate in Arnhem, were badly damaged or destroyed.{{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=52}}

==Entertainment career==

===1945–1952: Ballet studies and early acting roles===
After the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to [[Amsterdam]], where she began ballet training under [[Sonia Gaskell]], a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Russian teacher Olga Tarasova.{{sfn|Woodward|2012|pp=52–53}}

As the family's fortunes had been lost during the war, Ella supported them by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family.{{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=53}} Hepburn made her film debut playing an air stewardess in ''[[Dutch in Seven Lessons]]'' (1948), an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson.{{Sfn|Vermilye|1995|p=67}} Later that year, Hepburn moved to [[London]] after accepting a ballet scholarship with [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]], which was then based in [[Notting Hill]]. {{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=54}}{{efn|She had been offered the scholarship already in 1945, but had had to decline it due to "some uncertainty regarding her national status".{{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=52}}}} She supported herself with part-time work as a model, and dropped "Ruston" from her surname. After she was told by Rambert that despite her talent, her height and weak constitution (the after-effect of wartime malnutrition) would make the status of [[prima ballerina]] unattainable, she decided to concentrate on acting.&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph, 4 May 2014, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3592252/I-suppose-I-ended-Hepburns-career.html 'I suppose I ended Hepburn's career']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=Larry King Live |title=Audrey Hepburn's Son Remembers Her Life |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/24/lkl.00.html |airdate=24 December 2003 |network=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818831,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114122239/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818831,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 November 2007 |title=Princess Apparent |work=Time |date=7 September 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn was then offered a small role in a film being shot in both English and French, ''[[Monte Carlo Baby]]'' (French: ''Nous Irons à Monte Carlo'', 1952), which was filmed in [[Monte Carlo]]. Coincidentally, French novelist [[Colette]] was at the Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo during the filming, and decided to cast Hepburn in the title role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Gigi (play)|Gigi]]''.{{sfn|Thurman|1999|p=483}} Hepburn went into rehearsals having never spoken on stage, and required private coaching.&lt;ref name=broadwaygigi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/180286/history-lesson-learn-how-colette-audrey-hepburn-leslie-caron-vanessa-hudgens-transformed-gigi/ |title=History Lesson!

===1953–1960: ''Roman Holiday'' and stardom===
[[File:Audrey Hepburn screentest in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hepburn in a [[screen test]] for ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953) which was also used as promotional material for the film.]]
Hepburn had her first starring role in ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who escapes the reins of royalty and has a wild night out with an American newsman ([[Gregory Peck]]). The producers of the movie initially wanted [[Elizabeth Taylor]] for the role, but director [[William Wyler]] was so impressed by Hepburn's [[screen test]] that he cast her instead. Wyler later commented, "She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, 'That's the girl!{{'"}}{{sfn|Paris|2001|p=72}} Originally, the film was to have had only Gregory Peck's name above its title, with "Introducing Audrey Hepburn" beneath in smaller font. However, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing so that her name appeared before the title, and in type as large as his: "You've got to change that because she'll be a big star, and I'll look like a big jerk."{{Sfn|Fishgall|2002|p=173}}

The film was a box-office success, and Hepburn gained critical acclaim for her portrayal, unexpectedly winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role]], and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama]] in 1953. In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. H. Weiler]] wrote: "Although she is not precisely a newcomer to films, Audrey Hepburn, the British actress who is being starred for the first time as Princess Anne, is a slender, elfin, and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike in her profound appreciation of newly-found, simple pleasures and love. Although she bravely smiles her acknowledgement of the end of that affair, she remains a pitifully lonely figure facing a stuffy future."&lt;ref name=weilerelfin&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE6DA153EE53BBC4051DFBE668388649EDE |title='Roman Holiday' at Music Hall Is Modern Fairy Tale Starring Peck and Audrey Hepburn |first=A.

Hepburn was signed to a seven-picture contract with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], with 12 months in between films to allow her time for stage work.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Mike.

For her performance, she was nominated for the 1954 Academy Award for Best Actress, while winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role the same year. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' stated that she was "a young lady of extraordinary range of sensitive and moving expressions within such a frail and slender frame. She is even more luminous as the daughter and pet of the servants' hall than she was as a princess last year, and no more than that can be said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9406E3DF1238E23BBC4B51DFBF66838F649EDE |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |title=Screen: 'Sabrina' Bows at Criterion; Billy Wilder Produces and Directs Comedy |date=23 September 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1954, playing a water nymph who falls in love with a human in the fantasy play ''[[Ondine (play)|Ondine]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. A critic for ''The New York Times'' commented that "somehow, Miss Hepburn is able to translate [its intangibles] into the language of the theatre without artfulness or precociousness. She gives a pulsing performance that is all grace and enchantment, disciplined by an instinct for the realities of the stage". Her performance won her the 1954 [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play]] three days after she won the Academy Award for ''Roman Holiday'', making her one of three actresses to receive the Academy and Tony Awards for Best Actress in the same year (the other two are [[Shirley Booth]] and [[Ellen Burstyn]]).&lt;ref name=soundstage /&gt; During the production, Hepburn and her co-star [[Mel Ferrer]] began a relationship, and were married on 25 September 1954 in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2076351/Mel-Ferrer.html |title=Mel Ferrer |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=27 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She exhibited her dancing abilities in her debut [[musical film]], ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957), wherein [[Fred Astaire]], a fashion photographer, discovers a beatnik bookstore clerk (Hepburn) who, lured by a free trip to Paris, becomes a beautiful model. Hepburn starred in another romantic comedy, ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (also 1957), alongside [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]].

[[File:Hepburn-Perkins-1959.JPG|thumb|Hepburn with co-star [[Anthony Perkins]] in the film ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]] '' (1959)]]
Hepburn played Sister Luke in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959), which focuses on the character's struggle to succeed as a nun, alongside co-star [[Peter Finch]]. The role produced a third Academy Award nomination for Hepburn, and earned her a second BAFTA Award. A review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reads: "Hepburn has her most demanding film role, and she gives her finest performance", while Henry Hart in ''[[Films in Review]]'' stated that her performance "will forever silence those who have thought her less an actress than a symbol of the sophisticated child/woman.

Following ''The Nun's Story'', Hepburn received a lukewarm reception for starring with [[Anthony Perkins]] in the romantic adventure ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]]'' (1959), in which she played [[Rima]], a jungle girl who falls in love with a Venezuelan traveller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9805E3DB1038EF3BBC4851DFB5668382649EDE |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |title=Delicate Enchantment of 'Green Mansions'; Audrey Hepburn Stars in Role of Rima |date=20 March 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960), her only [[Western (genre)|western film]], in which she appeared opposite [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Lillian Gish]] in a story of racism against a group of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9800E2DD123AEF3ABC4F53DFB266838B679EDE |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |title=Screen: "The Unforgiven': Huston Film Stars Miss Hepburn, Lancaster |date=7 April 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1961–1967: ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and continued success===
Hepburn next starred as New Yorker Holly Golightly, in [[Blake Edwards]]'s ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), a film loosely based on the [[Truman Capote]] [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|novella]] of the same name.

[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant 1.jpg|thumb|left|Hepburn with [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963)]]
Hepburn next appeared opposite [[Cary Grant]] in the comic thriller ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963), playing a young widow pursued by several men who chase the fortune stolen by her murdered husband. The 59-year-old Grant, who had previously withdrawn from the starring male lead roles in ''Roman Holiday'' and ''Sabrina'', was sensitive about his age difference with 34-year-old Hepburn, and was uncomfortable about the romantic interplay. To satisfy his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to alter the screenplay so that Hepburn's character was pursuing him.{{Sfn|Eastman|1989|pp=57–58}} The film turned out to be a positive experience for him; he said, "All I want for Christmas is another picture with Audrey Hepburn."&lt;ref&gt;[http://audreyhepburnlibrary.com/60s/images/motionpicture5-64pg3.jpg How Awful About Audrey!], ''Motion Picture'', May 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The role earned Hepburn her third, and final, competitive BAFTA Award, and another Golden Globe nomination.

Hepburn reunited with her ''Sabrina'' co-star [[William Holden]] in ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]'' (1964), a [[screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]] in which she played the young assistant of a Hollywood screenwriter, who aids his [[writer's block]] by acting out his fantasies of possible plots. Its production was troubled by several problems. Holden unsuccessfully tried to rekindle a romance with the now-married Hepburn, and his alcoholism was beginning to affect his work.

[[Julie Andrews]], who had originated the role on stage, was not offered the part because producer [[Jack L. Warner]] thought Hepburn was a more "bankable" proposition.

As the decade carried on, Hepburn appeared in an assortment of genres including the heist comedy ''[[How to Steal a Million]]'' (1966) where she played the daughter of a famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries. Fearing her father's exposure, she sets out to steal one of his "priceless" statues with the help of a man played by [[Peter O'Toole]]. It was followed by two films in 1967. The first was ''[[Two for the Road (film)|Two for the Road]]'', a non-linear and innovative British [[comedy-drama|dramedy]] that traces the course of a couple's troubled marriage. Director [[Stanley Donen]] said that Hepburn was more free and happy than he had ever seen her, and he credited that to co-star [[Albert Finney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://audreyhepburnlibrary.com/60s/images/screenland12-67pg6.jpg Behind Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer's Breakup], ''[[Screenland]]'', December 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'', is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost fifteen pounds under the stress, but she found solace&lt;!-- in what way?--&gt; in co-star [[Richard Crenna]] and director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, "Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05E2DE1038E43BBC4F51DFB667838C679EDE |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |title=The Screen: Audrey Hepburn Stars in 'Wait Until Dark' |date=27 October 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968–1993: Semi-retirement and final projects===
[[File:Hepburn Connery Robin and Marian Still 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Hepburn and [[Sean Connery]] in the film ''[[Robin and Marian]]'' (1976)]]
After 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally in the following decades. She attempted a comeback playing [[Maid Marian]] in the [[period piece]] ''[[Robin and Marian]]'' (1976) with [[Sean Connery]] co-starring as [[Robin Hood]], which was moderately successful. [[Roger Ebert]] praised Hepburn's chemistry with Connery, writing, "Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love. And they project as marvelously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19760421/REVIEWS/604210301/1023 Chicago Sun-Times review by Roger Ebert ], 21 April 1976, Retrieved on 7 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of ''[[Bloodline (1979 film)|Bloodline]]'' (1979), sharing top-billing with [[Ben Gazzara]], [[James Mason]], and [[Romy Schneider]]. The film, an international intrigue amid the [[jet-set]], was a critical and box-office failure. Hepburn's last starring role in a feature film was opposite Gazzara in the comedy ''[[They All Laughed]]'' (1981), directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. The film was overshadowed by the murder of one of its stars, [[Dorothy Stratten]], and received only a limited release. Six years later, Hepburn co-starred with [[Robert Wagner]] in a [[television movie|made-for-television]] [[Heist film|caper film]], ''[[Love Among Thieves]]'' (1987).

After finishing her last motion picture role—a cameo appearance as an angel in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'' (1989)—Hepburn completed only two more entertainment-related projects, both critically acclaimed. ''[[Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn]]'' was a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary series, which was filmed on location in seven countries in the spring and summer of 1990. A one-hour special preceded it in March 1991, and the series itself began airing the day after her death, 21 January 1993.&lt;!--presumably a coincidence?--&gt; For the debut episode, Hepburn was posthumously awarded the 1993 [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement – Informational Programming. The other project was a spoken word album, ''[[Audrey Hepburn's Enchanted Tales]]'', which features readings of classic children's stories and was recorded in 1992. It earned her a posthumous [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/egot-winners-taylor-swift-chasing-article-1.2357354|title=EGOT winners Taylor Swift is chasing|newspaper=[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]|location=New York City|access-date=27 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian career==
In the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for [[UNICEF]], re-telling children's stories of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unmultimedia.org/classics/search/series.jsp?mediatype=&amp;q=audrey+hepburn&amp;advanced=&amp;series=UN+Radio+Classics&amp;sort=&amp;category=&amp;app=7|title=Classics |publisher= United Nations Audiovisual Library|language=en|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF]]. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/people/people_audrey_hepburn.html|title=Audrey Hepburn|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|access-date=27 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–1989===
[[File:Audrey Hepburn in Nederland ter gelegenheid van de Danny Kaye Award, samen met, Bestanddeelnr 934-5055.jpg|thumb|Hepburn receiving [[UNICEF]]'s International [[Danny Kaye]] Award for Children in 1989.]]
Hepburn's first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988. She visited an orphanage in [[Mek'ele]] that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} Of the trip, she said,
{{Blockquote|I have a broken heart. I feel desperate. I can't stand the idea that two million people are in imminent danger of starving to death, many of them children, [and] not because there isn't tons of food sitting in the northern port of [[Shewa|Shoa]]. It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image is too much for me. The 'Third World' is a term I don't like very much, because we're all one world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn in {{cite book |url=http://www.audrey1.org/biography/21/audrey-hepburn-unicef-overview|title=Betrayal: A Report on Violence Towards Children in Today's World|editor-first= Caroline|editor-last= Moorehead|chapter= Introduction|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=1990|isbn=978-0385410977| via=Audrey1.org (fan site)|archive-date=August 31, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120831214513/http://www.audrey1.org/biography/21/audrey-hepburn-unicef-overview|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 1988, Hepburn went to Turkey on an immunisation campaign. She called Turkey "the loveliest example" of UNICEF's capabilities. Of the trip, she said, "The army gave us their trucks, the fishmongers gave their wagons for the vaccines, and once the date was set, it took ten days to vaccinate the whole country. Not bad."&lt;ref name="UNICEF Missions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audrey1.org/biography/22/audrey-hepburns-unicef-field-missions |title=Audrey Hepburn's UNICEF Field Missions |access-date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Hepburn went to South America. Of her experiences in Venezuela and Ecuador, Hepburn told the United States Congress, "I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracle – and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paris|first=Barry|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34675183|title=Audrey Hepburn|date=1996|publisher=Putnam|isbn=0-399-14056-5|location=New York|oclc=34675183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and met with leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders as part of a mission called "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from [[aid agency|aid agencies]] had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to [[southern Sudan]]. Hepburn said, "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not [[natural disaster]]s but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace."&lt;ref name="UNICEF Missions" /&gt; In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. [[John Isaac (Photographer)|John Isaac]], a UN photographer, said, "Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her – she was like the [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]]."{{Sfn|Paris|2001}}

===1990–1992===
In October 1990, Hepburn went to Vietnam, in an effort to collaborate with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and [[Drinking water|clean water]] programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it "apocalyptic", she said, "I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this – so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this."&lt;ref name="UNICEF Missions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Newsweek]] |title=The Din of Silence |date=12 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. "Taking care of children has nothing to do with politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicisation of [[humanitarian aid]], there will be a humanisation of politics."

===Recognition===
United States president [[George H. W. Bush]] presented Hepburn with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in recognition of her work with [[UNICEF]], and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] posthumously awarded her the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] for her contribution to humanity.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/05/was-audrey-hepburn-the-queen-of-polyglotism/|title=Was Audrey Hepburn, the Queen of Polyglotism?|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|access-date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Paris|1996|p=91}}

In 2002, at the [[World Summit for Children#Special session|United Nations Special Session on Children]], UNICEF honoured Hepburn's legacy of humanitarian work by unveiling a statue, "The Spirit of Audrey", at UNICEF's New York headquarters. Her service for children is also recognised through the [[U.S. Fund for UNICEF|United States Fund for UNICEF]]'s Audrey Hepburn Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/specialsession/activities/hepburn.htm|title=Audrey Hepburn's work for the world's children honoured|publisher=unicef.org|access-date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/11/dl.00.html|title=U.N.

===Marriages, relationships, and children===
[[File:Audrey Hepburn Mel Ferrer Mayerling 1957.jpg|thumb|upright|Hepburn with first husband [[Mel Ferrer]] in ''[[Mayerling (1957 film)|Mayerling (1957)]]'']]
In 1952, Hepburn became engaged to industrialist [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|James Hanson]],{{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=131}} whom she had known since her early days in London. She called it "love at first sight", but after having her wedding dress fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hyams, Joe. [http://www.audreyhepburnlibrary.com/50s/images/filmland1-54pg4.jpg Why Audrey Hepburn Was Afraid Of Marriage], ''Filmland'', January 1954&lt;/ref&gt; She issued a public statement about her decision, saying "When I get married, I want to be ''really'' married".{{sfn|Woodward|2012|p=132}} In the early 1950s, she also dated future ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' producer [[Michael Butler (producer)|Michael Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;Kogan, Rick; [http://www.michaelbutler.com/orlok/michael/buttrib.html The Aging of Aquarius], Chicago Tribune, 6/30/96, michaelbutler.com.

At a cocktail party hosted by mutual friend [[Gregory Peck]], Hepburn met American actor [[Mel Ferrer]], and suggested that they star together in a play.&lt;ref name=soundstage /&gt;{{sfn|Walter|1997}} The meeting led them to collaborate in ''Ondine'', during which they began a relationship.

Despite the insistence from gossip columns that their marriage would not last, Hepburn claimed that she and Ferrer were inseparable and happy together, though she admitted that he had a bad temper.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://www.audreyhepburnlibrary.com/50s/images/everybodys3-10-56pg2.jpg 'My Husband Mel'], ''Everybodys'', 10 March 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer was rumoured to be too controlling, and had been referred to by others as being her "[[Svengali]]" – an accusation that Hepburn laughed off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://audreyhepburnlibrary.com/60s/images/screenland12-67pg4.jpg Behind Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer's Breakup], ''[[Screenland]]'', December 1967&lt;/ref&gt; William Holden was quoted as saying, "I think Audrey allows Mel to think he influences her."

[[File:President Ronald Reagan talking with Audrey Hepburn and Robert Wolders.jpg|thumb|Hepburn and her partner, [[Robert Wolders]] with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[White House]] in 1981]]
Hepburn met her second husband, Italian psychiatrist [[Andrea Dotti (psychiatrist)|Andrea Dotti]], on a [[Mediterranean]] cruise with friends in June 1968. She believed she would have more children and possibly stop working. They married on 18 January 1969, and their son Luca Andrea Dotti was born on 8 February 1970. While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via [[caesarean section]]. Both Dotti and Hepburn were unfaithful, with Dotti having affairs with younger women and Hepburn having a romantic relationship with actor [[Ben Gazzara]] during the filming of the movie [[Bloodline (1979 film)|''Bloodline'']] (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/movies/ben-gazzara-actor-of-stage-and-screen-dies-at-81.html |work=The New York Times |first=Neil |last=Genzlinger |title=Ben Gazzara, Actor of Stage and Screen, Dies at 81 |date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dotti-Hepburn marriage lasted thirteen years and was dissolved in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audrey Hepburn obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5894883/Audrey-Hepburn.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121030948/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5894883/Audrey-Hepburn.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 January 2010|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 until her death, Hepburn was in a relationship with Dutch actor [[Robert Wolders]],&lt;ref name="nytimesobit" /&gt; the widower of actress [[Merle Oberon]]. She had met Wolders through a friend during the later years of her second marriage. In 1989, she called the nine years she had spent with him the happiest years of her life, and stated that she considered them married, just not officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heatley|first1=Michael|title=Audrey Hepburn: In words and pictures|date=2017|publisher=Book Sales|isbn=978-0-7858-3534-9|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
[[File:Grave of Audrey Hepburn, Tolochenaz, Switzerland - 20080711.jpg|thumb|upright|Hepburn's grave in [[Tolochenaz]], Switzerland]]
Upon returning from Somalia to Switzerland in late September 1992, Hepburn began suffering from [[abdominal pain]]. While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a [[laparoscopy]] performed at the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging to a group of cancers known as [[pseudomyxoma peritonei]].{{sfn|Paris|1996|p=361}} Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had [[metastasis]]ed as a thin coating over her [[small intestine]]. After surgery, Hepburn began [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref name=cr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/Fall2009/Pages/AudreyHepburnAppendixCancer.aspx |title=Selim Jocelyn, ""The Fairest of All", ''CR Magazine'', Fall 2009 |publisher=Crmagazine.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419051634/http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/Fall2009/Pages/AudreyHepburnAppendixCancer.aspx |archive-date=19 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn and her family returned home to Switzerland to celebrate her last Christmas. As she was still recovering from surgery, she was unable to fly on commercial aircraft. Her longtime friend, fashion designer [[Hubert de Givenchy]], arranged for socialite [[Rachel Lambert Mellon|Rachel Lambert "Bunny" Mellon]] to send her private [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]] jet, filled with flowers, to take Hepburn from Los Angeles to [[Geneva]]. She spent her last days in [[hospice care]] at her home in [[Tolochenaz]], [[Vaud]] and was occasionally well enough to take walks in her garden, but gradually became more confined to bedrest.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=289}}

On the evening of 20 January 1993, Hepburn died in her sleep at home. After her death, [[Gregory Peck]] recorded a tribute to Hepburn in which he recited the poem "Unending Love" by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gregory Peck about Audrey Hepburn|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL_yVhwxCSY|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funeral services were held at the village church of Tolochenaz on 24 January 1993. Maurice Eindiguer, the same pastor who wed Hepburn and Mel Ferrer and baptised her son Sean in 1960, presided over her funeral, while [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]] of UNICEF delivered a eulogy. Many family members and friends attended the funeral, including her sons, partner Robert Wolders, half-brother Ian Quarles van Ufford, ex-husbands Andrea Dotti and Mel Ferrer, Hubert de Givenchy, executives of UNICEF, and fellow actors [[Alain Delon]] and [[Roger Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/25/arts/hepburn-s-role-as-ambassador-is-paid-tribute.html |work=The New York Times |first=David |last=Binder |title=Hepburn's Role As Ambassador Is Paid Tribute |date=25 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flower arrangements were sent to the funeral by Gregory Peck, [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and the [[Dutch royal family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063483,00.html |work=People |title=A Gentle Goodbye –Surrounded by the Men She Loved, the Star Was Laid to Rest on a Swiss Hilltop |date=1 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Hepburn's legacy has endured long after her death. The [[American Film Institute]] named Hepburn third among the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|Greatest Female Stars of All Time]]. She is one of few entertainers who have won [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards]]. She won a record three [[BAFTA Award]]s for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role#Superlatives|Best British Actress in a Leading Role]]. In her last years, she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] in 1991 and was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards. She received the [[BAFTA]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992.&lt;ref name="times2021"/&gt;

She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards including the 1993 [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards.

Hepburn's image is widely used in advertising campaigns across the world. In Japan, a series of commercials used [[colourised]] and digitally enhanced clips of Hepburn in ''Roman Holiday'' to advertise [[Kirin Brewery Company|Kirin]] [[black tea]]. In the United States, Hepburn was featured in a 2006 [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] commercial which used clips of her dancing from ''Funny Face'', set to [[AC/DC]]'s "[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]]", with the tagline "It's Back – The Skinny Black Pant". To celebrate its "Keep it Simple" campaign, the Gap made a sizeable donation to the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=5371942 |title=New Gap marketing campaign featuring original film footage of Audrey Hepburn helps Gap "Keeps it Simple" this Fall – WBOC-TV 16 |date=28 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010941/http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=5371942 |archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn's son Sean said that he was brought up in the countryside as a normal child, not in Hollywood and without a Hollywood state of mind that makes movie stars and their families lose touch with reality. There was no screening room in the house. He said that his mother didn't take herself seriously, and used to say "I take what I do seriously, but I don't take myself seriously".&lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;

Hepburn was known for her fashion choices and distinctive look, to the extent that journalist [[Mark Tungate]] has described her as a recognisable brand.{{sfnm|Sheridan|2010|1p=95}} When she first rose to stardom in ''Roman Holiday'' (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than men, in comparison to the curvy and more sexual [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name=newkind&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10252693/Audrey-Hepburn-a-new-kind-of-movie-star.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Anne |last=Billson |title=Audrey Hepburn: a new kind of movie star |date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnm|Hill|2004|1p=78}} With her short hairstyle, thick eyebrows, slim body, and "[[gamine]]" looks, she presented a look which young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars.&lt;ref name=moseleyguardian&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/07/highereducation.gender |title=Audrey Hepburn – everybody's fashion icon |first=Rachel |last=Moseley |work=The Guardian |date=7 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, fashion photographer [[Cecil Beaton]] declared Hepburn the "public embodiment of our new feminine ideal" in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', and wrote that "Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared."{{sfnm|Hill|2004|1p=78}} The magazine and its [[British Vogue|British version]] frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade.{{sfnm|Sheridan|2010|1p=93}} Alongside model [[Twiggy]], Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable.&lt;ref name=moseleyguardian /&gt;

Added to the [[International Best Dressed List]] in 1961, Hepburn was associated with a minimalistic style, usually wearing clothes with simple silhouettes which emphasised her slim body, monochromatic colours, and occasional statement accessories.&lt;ref name=BBCfuss&gt;{{cite news |title=Audrey Hepburn: Why the fuss? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4884428.stm |first=Megan |last=Lane |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s, Audrey Hepburn popularised plain black leggings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://laruemoderne.com/80s-fashion-trends/|title=80s Fashion Trends, Reborn!s|author=Naomi Harriet|publisher=La Rue Moderne|date=19 August 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821053509/http://laruemoderne.com/80s-fashion-trends/|archive-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Rachel Moseley describes the combination of "slim black trousers, flat ballet-style pumps and a fine black jersey" as one of her signature looks alongside little black dresses, noting that this style was new at the time when women still wore skirts and high heels more often than trousers and flat shoes.&lt;ref name=moseleyguardian /&gt;

Hepburn was in particular associated with French fashion designer [[Hubert de Givenchy]], who was first hired to design her on-screen wardrobe for her second Hollywood film, ''Sabrina'' (1954), when she was still unknown as a film actor and he a young [[couturier]] just starting [[Givenchy|his fashion house]].&lt;ref name=givenchyvf&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/02/audrey-hepburn-givenchy-style |title=When Hubert Met Audrey |work=Vanity Fair |first=Amy Fine |last=Collins |date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially disappointed that "Miss Hepburn" was not [[Katharine Hepburn]] as he had mistakenly thought, Givenchy and Hepburn formed a lifelong friendship.&lt;ref name=givenchyvf /&gt;&lt;ref name=vmagazine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/3772/hubert-de-givenchy--audrey-hepburn |title=Hubert de Givenchy &amp; Audrey Hepburn |work=V Magazine |first=Katharine K. |last=Zarrella |access-date=23 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510150422/http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/3772/hubert-de-givenchy--audrey-hepburn |archive-date=10 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She became his muse,&lt;ref name=givenchyvf /&gt;&lt;ref name=vmagazine /&gt; and the two became so closely associated with each other that academic Jayne Sheridan has stated "we might ask 'Did Audrey Hepburn create Givenchy or was it the other way around?'"{{sfnm|Sheridan|2010|1p=94}}

In addition to ''Sabrina'', Givenchy designed her costumes for ''Love in the Afternoon'' (1957), ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961), ''Funny Face'' (1957), ''Charade'' (1963), ''Paris When It Sizzles'' (1964), and ''How to Steal a Million'' (1966), as well as clothed her off screen.&lt;ref name=givenchyvf /&gt; According to Moseley, fashion plays an unusually central role in many of Hepburn's films, stating that "the costume is not tied to the character, functioning 'silently' in the [[mise-en-scène]], but as 'fashion' becomes an attraction in the aesthetic in its own right".{{sfnm|Moseley|2002|1p=39}} Hepburn herself stated that Givenchy "gave me a look, a kind, a silhouette. He has always been the best, and he stayed the best. Because he kept the spare style that I love. What is more beautiful than a simple sheath made an extraordinary way in a special fabric, and just two earrings?"&lt;ref name="Audrey Hepburn 1993"&gt;''"Regard sur Audrey Hepburn"'', ''Regard Magazine'' n° 4, Paris, January 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; She also became the face of Givenchy's first perfume, ''[[L'Interdit]]'', in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/news-features/TMG9176362/Beauty-Icon-Givenchys-LInterdit.html |title=Beauty Icon: Givenchy's ''L'Interdit'' |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Sonia |last=Haria |date=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her partnership with Givenchy, Hepburn was credited with boosting the sales of [[Burberry]] [[trench coat]]s when she wore one in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'', and was associated with Italian footwear brand [[Tod's]].{{sfnm|Sheridan|2010|1pp=92–95}}

[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on Vespa in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|With [[Gregory Peck]] in ''Roman Holiday'' (1953)]]
In her private life, Hepburn preferred to wear casual and comfortable clothes, contrary to the [[haute couture]] she wore on screen and at public events.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/hepburn-revival-feeding-false-image/2006/10/01/1159641215445.html |title=Hepburn revival feeding false image? |work=The Age |date=2 October 2006 |location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being admired for her beauty, she never considered herself attractive, stating in a 1959 interview that "you can even say that I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority. I couldn't conquer these feelings by acting indecisive. I found the only way to get the better of them was by adopting a forceful, concentrated drive."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Eleanor. [http://www.audreyhepburnlibrary.com/50s/images/goodhousekeeping8-59pg4.jpg Audrey Hepburn], ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', August 1959&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, she stated that "my look is attainable ... Women can look like Audrey Hepburn by flipping out their hair, buying the large glasses and the little sleeveless dresses."&lt;ref name=BBCfuss /&gt;

Hepburn's influence as a style icon continues several decades after the height of her acting career in the 1950s and 1960s. Moseley notes that especially after her death in 1993, she became increasingly admired, with magazines frequently advising readers on how to get her look and fashion designers using her as inspiration.{{sfnm|Moseley|2002|1pp=1–10}}&lt;ref name=moseleyguardian /&gt; In 2004, Hepburn was named the "most beautiful woman of all time"&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3763887.stm |title=Audrey Hepburn tops beauty poll |work=BBC News |date=31 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "most beautiful woman of the 20th century"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Actress Tops Poll of 20th Century Beauties |url=http://news.sky.com/story/788826/actress-tops-poll-of-20th-century-beauties |work=Sky |date=1 July 2010 |first=Lulu |last=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt; in polls by [[Evian]] and [[QVC]] respectively, and in 2015, was voted "the most stylish Brit of all time" in a poll commissioned by [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/audrey-hepburn-is-officially-britain-s-style-icon-22-years-after-her-death-10207051.html |title=Audrey Hepburn is officially Britain's style icon – 22 years after her death |first=Linda |last=Sharkey |work=[[The Independent]] |date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her film costumes fetch large sums of money in auctions: one of the "[[Black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn|little black dresses]]" designed by Givenchy for ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was sold by [[Christie's]] for a record sum of £467,200 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?sid=&amp;intObjectID=4832498&amp;AllObjectIDs=&amp;SRObjectID=&amp;AllSaleIDs=&amp;SRSaleID=&amp;RefineQueryURL= Christie's online catalog].
