'''Alternative rock''' (also called '''alternative music''', '''alt-rock''', or simply '''alternative''') is a category of [[rock music]] that emerged from the [[independent music]] underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s. "Alternative" refers to the genre's distinction from [[Popular culture|mainstream]] or commercial rock or pop music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, [[DIY ethic|DIY]] ethos of [[punk rock]], which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music.&lt;ref name="altguitar"&gt;di Perna, Alan. "Brave Noise—The History of Alternative Rock Guitar". ''[[Guitar World]]''. December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, alternative rock varied greatly in terms of its sound, social context and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and [[zine]]s, [[college radio]] [[airplay]], and [[word of mouth]] had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as [[noise pop]], [[indie rock]], [[grunge]], and [[shoegazing]]. In September 1988, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] introduced "alternative" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles and [[WQBU-FM|WDRE-FM]] in New York, which were playing music from more [[Underground music|underground]], independent, and non-commercial rock artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Billboard Debuts Weekly Chart of Alternative Rock |first=Sean |last=Ross |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=September 10, 1988 |volume=100 |issue=37 |page=1,10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8478983/alternative-songs-first-chart-1988-rewind |title=Rewinding the Charts: In 1988, Alternative Songs Launched, With Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees' 'Peek-a-Boo' as the First No. 1 |first=Gary |last=Trust |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October 11, 2018 |access-date=June 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as [[R.E.M.]] and [[Jane's Addiction]], were signed to [[major labels]]. But most alternative bands remained signed to [[independent label]]s and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the popularity of the [[grunge]] and [[Britpop]] movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.

Due to success of bands such as [[the Strokes]] and [[the White Stripes]] in the early 2000s, an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s, establishing the [[post-punk revival]] movement.

==Origin of term==
In the past, popular music tastes were dictated by music executives within large entertainment corporations. Record companies signed contracts with those entertainers who were thought to become the most popular, and therefore who could generate the most sales. These bands were able to record their songs in expensive studios, and their works then offered for sale through record store chains that were owned by the entertainment corporations, along with eventually selling the merchandise into [[big box retailers]]. Record companies worked with radio and television companies to get the most exposure for their artists. The people making the decisions were business people dealing with music as a product, and those bands who were not making the expected sales figures were then excluded from this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kallen|first1=Stuart A.|title=The History of Alternative Rock|publisher=Lucent Books|year=2012|pages=6–7|isbn=978-1-4205-0738-6|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=-IhmDwAAQBAJ|page=6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the term ''alternative rock'' came into common usage around 1990, the sorts of music to which it refers were known by a variety of terms.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[Terry Tolkin]] used the term ''Alternative Music'' to describe the groups he was writing about.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Dallas radio station [[KBFB|KZEW]] had a late night [[New wave music|new wave]] show entitled "Rock and Roll Alternative."&lt;ref&gt;"Are We Not New Wave Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s by Theo Cateforis University of Michigan Press 2011 p. 38 {{ISBN|9780472115556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[College rock]]" was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the [[Campus radio|college radio]] circuit and the tastes of college students.&lt;ref name="Reynolds391"&gt;Reynolds, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, dozens of small [[DIY ethic|do it yourself]] record labels emerged as a result of the [[punk subculture]]. According to the founder of one of these labels, [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]], ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazines published charts based on small record stores called "Alternative Charts." The first national chart based on distribution called the [[UK Indie Chart|Indie Chart]] was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term ''indie'' was used literally to describe independently distributed records.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Bob. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/31/indie-chart-rise-again "Will the indie chart rise again?"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. July 31, 2009. Retrieved July 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, ''indie'' had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.&lt;ref name="Reynolds391" /&gt;

The use of the term ''alternative'' to describe rock music originated around the mid-1980s;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dave. "Introduction". ''Third Ear: Alternative Rock''. San Francisco: Miller Freeman, 2000. p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, the common music industry terms for cutting-edge music were ''[[Post-punk#History|new music]]'' and ''[[Postmodern music|post modern]]'', respectively indicating freshness and a tendency to reontextualize sounds of the past.&lt;ref name="altguitar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar term, ''alternative pop'', emerged around 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=alternative pop |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative%20pop |website=Merriam-Webster |access-date=May 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine categorized [[college rock]] band [[Camper Van Beethoven]] as "alternative/indie," noting that their 1985 song "Where the Hell Is Bill" (from ''[[Telephone Free Landslide Victory]]'') "called out the alternative/independent scene and dryly tore it apart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNSW1RIkidsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA24 |page=24 |last=Leland |first=John |author-link=John Leland (journalist) |date=May 1987 |title=Campers |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=3 |number=2 |issn=0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lowery (musician)|David Lowery]], then frontman of Camper Van Beethoven, later recalled: "I remember first seeing that word applied to us... The nearest I could figure is that we seemed like a punk band, but we were playing pop music, so they made up this word ''alternative'' for those of us who do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/crackers-with-attitude-56959/ |title=Crackers with Attitude  |last=Puterbaugh |first=Parke |date=7 April 1994 |website=[[rollingstone.com]] |access-date=26 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; DJs and promoters during the 1980s claim the term originates from American [[FM radio]] of the 1970s, which served as a progressive alternative to [[top 40]] [[radio format]]s by featuring longer songs and giving DJs more freedom in song selection. According to one former DJ and promoter, "Somehow this term 'alternative' got rediscovered and heisted by [[Campus radio|college radio]] people during the 80s who applied it to new post-punk, indie, or underground-whatever music."&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Brendan. ''Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. p. 19. {{ISBN|0-306-81347-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the term referred to intentionally non-mainstream rock acts that were not influenced by "heavy metal ballads, rarefied new wave" and "high-energy dance anthems."&lt;ref name=1997Definition&gt;[[Neil Strauss|Strauss, Neil]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/02/arts/forget-pearl-jam-alternative-rock-lives.html "Forget Pearl Jam. Alternative Rock Lives"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 2, 1997. Retrieved July 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term would broaden to include [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[post-punk]], and occasionally "[[college rock|college]]"/"[[Indie rock|indie]]" rock, all found on the American "commercial alternative" radio stations of the time such as [[Los Angeles]]' [[KROQ-FM]]. Journalist Jim Gerr wrote that ''Alternative'' also encompassed variants such as "rap, trash, metal and industrial."&lt;ref name=gerr /&gt; The bill of the first [[Lollapalooza]], an itinerant festival in North America conceived by [[Jane's Addiction]] frontman [[Perry Farrell]], reunited "disparate elements of the alternative rock community" including [[Henry Rollins]], [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Ice-T]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] (as second headliners) and Jane's Addiction (as the headlining act).&lt;ref name=gerr /&gt; Covering for MTV the opening date of Lollapalooza in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in July 1991, [[Dave Kendall]] introduced the report saying the festival presented the "most diverse lineups of alternative rock."&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Dave. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGJd77uzjw&amp;t=30s "MTV Week in Rock - Lollapalooza"]. youtube. July 1991. November 2, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, Farrell had coined the term ''Alternative Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jake |last=Brown|title=Jane's Addiction: In the Studio |publisher=Black Market Publishing |year=2011 |isbn=9780972614276}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1991, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine noted: "this year, for the first time, it became resoundingly clear that what has formerly been considered ''alternative rock''—a college-centered marketing group with fairly lucrative, if limited, potential—has in fact moved into the mainstream."&lt;ref name=gerr&gt;{{citation |last=Gerr|first=Jim |title=Artist of the Year: Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction |work=Spin (magazine)|date=December 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the definition again became more specific.&lt;ref name="altguitar"/&gt; In 1997, [[Neil Strauss]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' defined alternative rock as "hard-edged rock distinguished by brittle, '70s-inspired guitar riffing and singers agonizing over their problems until they take on epic proportions."&lt;ref name=1997Definition/&gt;

Defining music as alternative is often difficult because of two conflicting applications of the word. ''Alternative'' can describe music that challenges the status quo and that is "fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream", but the term is also used in the music industry to denote "the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Larry; Waterman, Christopher. ''American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MTV''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2003. p. 430. {{ISBN|0-19-510854-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term "alternative" to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolan|first1=Emily|title='...This little ukulele tells the truth':indie pop and kitsch authenticity|journal=Popular Music|date=2010|volume=29/3|issue=3|pages=457–469|doi=10.1017/s0261143010000437|s2cid=194113672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book ''Alternative Rock'' cites the formation of the [[Sex Pistols]] as well as the release of the albums ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]'' by [[Patti Smith]] and ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' by [[Lou Reed]] as three key events that gave birth to alternative rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&amp;q=thompson,Dave.+Alternative+Rock.|title=Alternative Rock|first=Dave|last=Thompson|date=December 31, 2018|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780879306076|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 2000s, when [[indie rock]] became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms "indie rock" and "alternative rock" were often used interchangeably;&lt;ref name=Fonarow&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wendy-fonarow Fonarow, Wendy] (July 28, 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jul/28/indie-professor "Ask the indie professor: why do Americans think they invented indie? For years, Americans never used the term 'indie', preferring to label the likes of Bush 'alternative'. But things changed"]. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst there are aspects which both genres have in common, "indie rock" was regarded as a British-based term, unlike the more American "alternative rock."&lt;ref&gt;Carew, Anthony.

==Characteristics==
The name "alternative rock" essentially serves as an [[umbrella term]] for underground music that has emerged in the wake of [[punk rock]] since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{AllMusic|class=explore|id=essay/american-alternative-rock--post-punk-t578|pure_url=yes}} "American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of its history, alternative rock has been largely defined by its rejection of the [[commercialism]] of mainstream culture, although this could be contested ever since some of the major alternative artists have achieved mainstream success or co-opted with the major labels from the 1990s onwards (especially since the new millennium and beyond). Alternative bands during the 1980s generally played in small clubs, recorded for indie labels, and spread their popularity through word of mouth.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;"Rock Music". Microsoft Encarta 2006 [CD]. Redmond, WA: Microsoft Corporation, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1989 asserted that the genre is "guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback."&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, Jon.

Retrieved July 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than in other rock-styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism.&lt;ref name="encarta"/&gt; This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Katherine.

==History==

===Precursors (1960s and 1970s)===
A precursor to alternative rock existed in the 1960s with the [[proto-punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.spin.com/2013/03/best-100-albums-1960s-sixties-alternative-list/ | title=The Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s| date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of alternative rock can be traced back to ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'' (1967) by [[the Velvet Underground]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20131125-do-the-velvets-beat-the-beatles BBC Culture "The Velvet Underground: As influential as The Beatles?"]&lt;/ref&gt; which influenced many alternative rock bands that would come after it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Velvet-Underground Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric and quirky figures of the 1960s, such as [[Syd Barrett]] have influence on alternative rock in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=John|last1=Harris|title=Barrett's influence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/12/popandrock.sydbarrett2|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Padova REM concert July 22 2003 blue.jpg|alt=Male singer in white shirtsleeves and trousers, with a band behind him on a small stage.|thumb|left|One of the first popular alternative rock bands, [[R.E.M.]] relied on [[Campus radio|college-radio]] airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.]]

The [[Dead Kennedys]] formed the [[independent record label]] [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 1979, releasing influential underground music such as the 1983 [[Butthole Surfers (EP)|self-titled EP]] from the [[Butthole Surfers]]. By 1984, a majority of groups signed to indie labels mined from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper-rational post-punk years.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p.&amp;nbsp;392–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote="Alternative music is music that hasn't yet achieved a mainstream audience, Alternative isn't new wave any more, it's a disposition of mind. Alternative music is any kind of music that has the potential to reach a wider audience. It also has real strength, real quality, real excitement, and it has to be socially significant, as opposed to Whitney Houston, which is pablum."|source=—Mark Josephson, Executive Director of the [[New Music Seminar]] speaking in 1988&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;|width=27%|style=padding:8px;}}

Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock remained mainly an underground phenomenon. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, [[fanzine]]s, and [[Campus radio|college radio]] stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt; College radio formed an essential part of breaking new alternative music. In the mid-1980s, college station [[KCPR]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], described in a DJ handbook the tension between popular and "cutting edge" songs as played on "alternative radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdLsQBjl0-IC&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108 |last='Enthal |first=Andrea |date=April 1986 |title=College Radio |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=2 |number=1 |issn=0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 1988, an [[Alternative Songs]] chart was created by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', listing the 40 most-played songs on alternative and modern rock radio stations in the US: the first number one was [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' "[[Peek-a-Boo (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Peek-a-Boo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Top 10 Billboard Chart Milestones |work=Billboard magazine |page=17 |date=November 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Public Image Limited]] and [[the Sugarcubes]] toured the United States arena circuit.&lt;ref&gt;"Review/Rock; Arena-Size Bill of Alternative Rock". ''The New York Times''. July 21, 1989. "It was the final show on a package tour that brought what used to be post-punk ''alternative'' rock, the province of clubs and cult audiences, to the arena circuit across the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US.&lt;ref name="British alt-rock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/british-alternative-rock-t579 |title=British Alternative Rock |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[AllMusic]] |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028135054/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/british-alternative-rock-t579 |archive-date=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by [[disc jockey]]s such as [[John Peel]] (who championed alternative music on [[BBC Radio 1]]), [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]], and [[Annie Nightingale]]. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

====American underground in the 1980s====

Early American alternative bands such as [[the Dream Syndicate]], [[the Bongos]], [[10,000 Maniacs]], [[R.E.M.]], [[the Feelies]] and [[Violent Femmes]] combined punk influences with [[folk music]] and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REM Biography|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/R-E-M-Biography/9B195AA5AA60344A482568940015EB16|publisher=Sing 365|access-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702122250/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/R-E-M-Biography/9B195AA5AA60344A482568940015EB16|archive-date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' [[Paisley Underground]] revived the sounds of the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as [[the Velvet Underground]].&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt;

American indie record labels [[SST Records]], [[Twin/Tone Records]], [[Touch and Go Records]], and [[Dischord Records]] presided over the shift from the [[hardcore punk]] that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.&lt;ref name=Reynolds390&gt;Reynolds, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minneapolis]] bands [[Hüsker Dü]] and [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt; [[Michael Azerrad]] asserted that Hüsker Dü was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of [[college rock]] that emerged. Azerrad wrote, "Hüsker Dü played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indie music pioneer returns with a little help from his admirershis|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/indie-music-pioneer-returns-with-a-little-help-from-his-admirers-20130305-2fivn.html|access-date=June 20, 2013|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band also set an example by being the first group from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as "a viable commercial enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on heartfelt songwriting and wordplay instead of political concerns, the Replacements upended a number of underground scene conventions; Azerrad noted that "along with R.E.M., they were one of the few underground bands that mainstream people liked."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop ([[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]), to [[noise rock]] ([[Sonic Youth]], [[Big Black]], [[the Jesus Lizard]]&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=the-jesus-lizard-mn0000089305|pure_url=yes}} "The Jesus Lizard Biography"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[industrial rock]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of [[Boston]]'s [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Los Angeles]]' [[Jane's Addiction]].&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt; Around the same time, the [[grunge]] [[subgenre]] emerged in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], initially referred to as "The Seattle Sound" until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rock.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/Most-Influential-Seattle-Bands.htm | title=Here's a List of the Top Most Influential Grunge Bands from Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grunge featured a sludgy, murky guitar sound that syncretized [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genre&amp;nbsp;– Grunge|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=grunge-ma0000002626|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted largely by Seattle indie label [[Sub Pop]], grunge bands were noted for their [[Charity shop|thrift store]] fashion which favored [[flannel shirts]] and [[combat boots]] suited to the local weather.&lt;ref name="success NYT"&gt;Marin, Rick. "Grunge: A Success Story". ''The New York Times''. November 15, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Early grunge bands [[Soundgarden]] and [[Mudhoney]] found critical acclaim in the U.S. and UK, respectively.&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt;

By the end of the decade, a number of alternative bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings Hüsker Dü and the Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in their wake such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative's later breakthrough.&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;Azerrad (1994), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (1994), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt;

In the middle of the decade, Hüsker Dü's album ''[[Zen Arcade]]'' influenced other hardcore acts by tackling personal issues. Out of Washington, D.C.'s hardcore scene what was called "emocore" or, later, "[[emo]]" emerged and was noted for its lyrics which delved into emotional, very personal subject matter (vocalists sometimes cried) and added free association poetry and a confessional tone. [[Rites of Spring]] has been described as the first "emo" band. Former [[Minor Threat]] singer [[Ian MacKaye]] founded [[Dischord Records]] which became the center for the city's emo scene.&lt;ref name=Allmusicemo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/emo-ma0000004447|title=Emo Music Genre Overview|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British subgenres and trends of the 1980s====
[[File:Robertsmith.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders shot of man, with wild, tangled hair and lipstick on, playing in a stage spotlight.|thumb|[[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[the Cure]]]]

[[Gothic rock]] developed out of late-1970s British [[post-punk]]. With a reputation as the "darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock", gothic rock utilizes a synthesizer-and-guitar based sound drawn from post-punk to construct "foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes", and the subgenre's lyrics often address literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and supernatural mysticism.&lt;ref name="Goth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Genre&amp;nbsp;– Goth Rock|website=[[AllMusic]] |url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=goth-rock-ma0000002623|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands of this subgenre took inspiration from two British post-punk groups, [[Joy Division]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]' debut single "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]", released in 1979, is considered to be the proper beginning of the gothic rock subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Cure]]'s "oppressively dispirited" albums including ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]'' (1982) cemented that group's stature in that style and laid the foundation for its large cult following.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key British alternative rock band to emerge during the 1980s was [[Manchester]]'s [[the Smiths]]. Music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] singled out the Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as "the two most important alt-rock bands of the day", commenting that they "were eighties bands only in the sense of being ''against'' the eighties".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene through the end of the decade, as various bands drew from singer [[Morrissey]]'s English-centered lyrical topics and guitarist [[Johnny Marr]]'s jangly guitar-playing style.&lt;ref name="British alt-rock" /&gt; The ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]'' cassette, a 1986 ''[[NME]]'' premium featuring [[Primal Scream]], [[the Wedding Present]] and others, was a major influence on the development of [[indie pop]] and the British [[Indie music scene|indie scene]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Hann, Michael | date=October 13, 2004 | title=Fey City Rollers | work=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/oct/13/popandrock| access-date=July 19, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Hasted, Nick | date=October 27, 2006 | title=How an NME cassette launched indie music | work=The Independent | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/how-an-nme-cassette-launched-indie-music-421802.html | access-date=July 19, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]]'s sound combined the [[Velvet Underground]]'s "melancholy noise" with [[Beach Boys]] pop melodies and [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[Wall of Sound]]" production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-jesus-and-mary-chain/biography|title=The Jesus and Mary Chain Biography|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=July 20, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJct1800?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-jesus-and-mary-chain/biography|archive-date=April 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303087/the-Jesus-and-Mary-Chain?anchor=ref666600|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: the Jesus and Mary Chain|access-date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with [[disco]] and [[dance music]].&lt;ref name="British alt-rock"/&gt; The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr., [[C86 (album)|C86]] and the [[dream pop]] of [[Cocteau Twins]], were the formative influences for the [[shoegazing]] movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar [[effects pedal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/27/popandrock|title=Diamond gazers|location=London|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Jude|last=Rogers|date=July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; onstage rather than interact with the audience, shoegazing acts like [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and [[Slowdive]] created an overwhelmingly loud "wash of sound" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genre&amp;nbsp;– Shoegaze|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=shoegaze-ma0000004454|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the [[Madchester]] scene. Performing for the most part in [[the Haçienda]], a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and [[Factory Records]], [[Madchester]] bands such as [[Happy Mondays]] and [[the Stone Roses]] mixed [[acid house]] dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genre&amp;nbsp;– Madchester|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=madchester-ma0000005017|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization in the 1990s===
[[File:Alanis Morissette at Espacio Movistar 6.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' by [[Alanis Morissette]] winning the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] is considered a landmark moment for the genre.]]

{{Listen|filename=NirvanaSmellsLikeTeenSpirit.ogg|title="Smells Like Teen Spirit"|description=Sample of "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s breakthrough album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). The sample illustrates the change in dynamics from verse to pre-chorus and chorus. This structure of "quiet verses with wobbly, [[Chorus effect|chorused]] guitar, followed by big, loud [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-inspired choruses" became a much-emulated template in alternative rock because of "Teen Spirit."&lt;ref name="altguitar"/&gt;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock's commercial possibilities and major labels had already signed [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Dinosaur Jr.]]&lt;ref name="buzz"/&gt; In early 1991, R.E.M. went mainstream worldwide with ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' while becoming a blueprint for many alternative bands.&lt;ref name="American alt-rock"/&gt; [[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kurt Cobain]] (foreground) and [[Krist Novoselic]] with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] live at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.]] The first edition of the Lollapalooza festival became the most successful tour in North America in July and August 1991. For [[Dave Grohl]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] who caught it near Los Angeles in an open-air amphitheater, "it felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all". The tour helped change the mentalities in the music industry: "by that fall, radio and MTV and music had changed. I really think that if it weren’t for Perry [Farrell], if it weren’t for ''Lollapalooza'', you and I wouldn’t be having this conversation right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brent |last=DiCrescenzo|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-extended-interview-lollapalooza-2011|title=Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters Extended interview Lollapalooza 2011|work=Time Out |date=July 28, 2011|access-date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the Nirvana's single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" in September 1991 "marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon". Helped by constant airplay of the song's music video on [[MTV]], their album ''[[Nevermind]]'' was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Its success surprised the music industry. ''Nevermind'' not only popularized grunge, but also established "the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Olsen, Eric | title=10 years later, Cobain lives on in his music | publisher=[[Today.com]].com | url=https://www.today.com/popculture/10-years-later-cobain-lives-his-music-wbna4652653 | date=April 9, 2004 | access-date=July 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Azerrad asserted that ''Nevermind'' symbolized "a sea-change in rock music" in which the [[glam metal|hair metal]] that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was authentic and culturally relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;229–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The breakthrough success of Nirvana led to the widespread popularization of alternative rock in the 1990s.

At the same time, critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad.

{{Main|Indie rock}}Long synonymous with alternative rock as a whole in the US, [[indie rock]] became a distinct form following the popular breakthrough of Nirvana.&lt;ref name="allmusic indie rock" /&gt; Indie rock was formulated as a rejection of alternative rock's absorption into the mainstream by artists who could not or refused to cross over, and a wariness of its "macho" aesthetic. While indie rock artists share the punk rock distrust of commercialism, the genre does not entirely define itself against that, as "the general assumption is that it's virtually impossible to make indie rock's varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place".&lt;ref name="allmusic indie rock"&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=indie-rock-ma0000004453|pure_url=yes}} | title=Indie Rock | access-date=August 2, 2009 | website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labels such as [[Matador Records]], [[Merge Records]], and [[Dischord Records|Dischord]], and indie rockers like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Superchunk]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], and [[Sleater-Kinney]] dominated the American [[Indie music scene|indie scene]] for most of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001), pp. 495–97.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality [[cassette tapes]], initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and [[Sebadoh]] became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like [[Beck]] and [[Liz Phair]] brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences.&lt;ref name="allmusic lofi"&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=lo-fi-ma0000002701|pure_url=yes}} | title=Lo-Fi | access-date=August 2, 2009 | website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, [[PJ Harvey]] fit into this sub group.&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=pj harvey|bio=true}} "PJ Harvey Biography"].

==== Post-grunge ====
{{Main|Post-grunge}}
[[File:Creed (band) in 2002.jpg|thumb|right|Post-grunge band [[Creed (band)|Creed]] in 2002]]
During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by [[post-grunge]]. Many post-grunge bands lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely "a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock."; many post-grunge bands emulated the sound and style of grunge, "but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists."&lt;ref name="allmusic postgrunge" /&gt; Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production.&lt;ref name="allmusic postgrunge"&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=post-grunge-ma0000005020|pure_url=yes}} | title=Post-Grunge | access-date=August 28, 2007 | website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, post-grunge was a label used almost pejoratively on bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and emulated the grunge sound. The label suggested that bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an "authentic" rock movement.&lt;ref name="PostGrungeAbout"&gt;{{cite web| author=Grierson, Tim |url=http://rock.about.com/od/rockmusic101/a/PostGrunge.htm|title=Post-Grunge. A History of Post-Grunge Rock |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bush (British band)|Bush]], [[Candlebox]] and [[Collective Soul]] were labelled almost pejoratively as post-grunge which, according to Tim Grierson of [[About.com]], is "suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in [[rock music]]."&lt;ref name="PostGrungeAbout" /&gt; Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands such as [[Foo Fighters]], [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Nickelback]] emerged.&lt;ref name="PostGrungeAbout" /&gt;

==== Post-rock ====
{{Main|Post-rock}}[[Post-rock]] was established by [[Talk Talk]]'s ''[[Laughing Stock (album)|Laughing Stock]]'' and [[Slint]]'s ''[[Spiderland]]'' albums, both released in 1991.&lt;ref name="allmusic postrock" /&gt; Post-rock draws influence from a number of genres, including [[Krautrock]], [[progressive rock]], and [[jazz]]. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music.&lt;ref name="allmusic postrock" /&gt; While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994 referring to ''[[Hex (Bark Psychosis album)|Hex]]'' by the London group [[Bark Psychosis]],&lt;ref name="Mojo"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=5803|title=Bark Psychosis: ''Hex''|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=March 1994|access-date=July 8, 2008|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the style of the genre was solidified by the release of ''[[Millions Now Living Will Never Die]]'' (1996) by the Chicago group [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]].&lt;ref name="allmusic postrock" /&gt; Post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as [[Thrill Jockey]], [[Kranky (record label)|Kranky]], [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]], and [[Too Pure]].&lt;ref name="allmusic postrock"&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=post-rock-ma0000002790|pure_url=yes}} | title=Post-Rock | access-date=July 28, 2009 | website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related genre, [[math rock]], peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock relies on more complex [[time signatures]] and intertwining phrases.&lt;ref name="allmusic mathrock"&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=math-rock-ma0000012250|pure_url=yes}} | title=Math Rock | access-date=August 6, 2009 | website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its "dispassionate intellectuality" and its perceived increasing predictability, but a new wave of post-rock bands such as [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and [[Sigur Rós]] emerged who further expanded the genre.&lt;ref name="allmusic postrock" /&gt;

==== Other trends ====
[[File:Reel Big Fish live in Santa Cruz.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Reel Big Fish]] performing in 2008]]

In 1993, [[Smashing Pumpkins]] album ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' was a major commercial success. The strong influence of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]] on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and close the gap between alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s [[Album Oriented Rock]] radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/smashing-pumpkins-mn0000036521|title=The Smashing Pumpkins – Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1995, [[Smashing Pumpkins]] also released their double album ''[[Mellon Collie &amp; the Infinite Sadness]]'' which went on to sell 10&amp;nbsp;million copies in the US alone, certifying it as a Diamond record.

After almost a decade in the underground, [[ska punk]], a mixture of earlier [[2 Tone (music genre)|British ska]] and punk acts, became popular in the United States. [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] was the first of the "Third Wave Ska Revival" acts to break. In 1996, [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[No Doubt]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Less Than Jake]] and [[Save Ferris]] charted or received radio exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dave.

====Change in sound====
{{quote box|quote=The Amerindie of the early '80s became known as alternative or alt-rock, ascendant from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] until 1996 or so but currently very unfashionable, never mind that the music is still there.|source=— ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]]'' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=2000|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/intro.php|title=CG 90s: Introduction|website=robertchristgau.com|access-date=April 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=23%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

By the end of the decade, alternative rock's style changed due to a number of events, notably the [[Death of Kurt Cobain|death]] of Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]] in 1994 and Pearl Jam's lawsuit against concert venue promoter [[Ticketmaster]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} which in effect barred the group from playing many major venues around the United States.&lt;ref name="decade"/&gt; In addition to the decline of grunge bands, Britpop faded as Oasis's third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997), received lackluster reviews and Blur began to incorporate influences from American alternative rock.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; A signifier of alternative rock's changes was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival's troubles that year, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now".&lt;ref&gt;Weisbard, Eric. "This Monkey's Gone to Heaven". ''Spin''. July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a change in style, alternative rock still managed to be mainstream. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, when bands like [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Matchbox Twenty]] became among the most popular rock bands in the United States.&lt;ref name="allmusic postgrunge"/&gt; At the same time Britpop began to decline, [[Radiohead]] achieved critical acclaim with its third album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), and its follow-ups ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) and ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with [[post-Britpop]] groups like [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Coldplay]], were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p.&amp;nbsp;369–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jimmy Eat World Reading.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Emo band [[Jimmy Eat World]] performing in 2007]]

In the mid-1990s, [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] defined the [[emo]] genre. [[Weezer]]'s album ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996) was also influential. By 2000 and on into the new decade, emo was one of the most popular rock music genres.&lt;ref name=Allmusicemo/&gt; Popular acts included the sales success of ''[[Bleed American]]'' by [[Jimmy Eat World]] (2001) and [[Dashboard Confessional]]'s ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name=DeRogatis2003&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.

[[File:Muse (4309212538).jpg|left|thumb|[[Muse (band)|Muse]] performing in 2010]]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including [[the Strokes]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]] and [[The Rapture (band)|the Rapture]] that drew primary inspiration from post-punk and new wave, establishing the [[post-punk revival]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=new-wave-post-punk-revival-ma0000012020|pure_url=yes}} | title=New Wave/Post-Punk Revival | access-date=August 6, 2009 | website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preceded by the success of bands such as the Strokes and [[the White Stripes]] earlier in the decade, an influx of new alternative rock bands, including several post-punk revival artists and others such as [[the Killers]], and [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s. Owing to the success of these bands, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' declared in 2004, "After almost a decade of domination by [[rap rock|rap-rock]] and [[nu metal|nu-metal]] bands, mainstream alt-rock is finally good again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author1=Hiatt, Brian |author2=Bonin, Lian |author3=Volby, Karen | date=July 9, 2004 | title=The Return of (Good) Alt-Rock | magazine=EW.com | url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,659881,00.html | access-date=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] experienced a notable rise in popularity during the latter half of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leahey|first1=Andrew|title=Thirty Seconds to Mars|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/thirty-seconds-to-mars-mn0000485365/biography|website=AllMusic|publisher=All Media Network|access-date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers entered a new-found popularity in 1999 after the release of their album ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), with continued success throughout the 2000s.
