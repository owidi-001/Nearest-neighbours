'''Kurt Vonnegut''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɒ|n|ə|ɡ|ə|t}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bookbrowse.com/authors/author_pronunciations/detail/index.cfm/author_number/386/kurt-vonnegut|title=How to pronounce Kurt Vonnegut|website=Bookbrowse.com|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; November 11, 1922 – April 11, 2007) was an American writer. In a career spanning over 50 years, he published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five nonfiction works, with further collections being published after his death.

Born and raised in [[Indianapolis]], Vonnegut attended [[Cornell University]] but withdrew in January 1943 and enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) and the [[University of Tennessee]]. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in [[World War II]] and was captured by the Germans during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. He was interned in [[Dresden]], where he survived the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allied bombing of the city]] in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, he married Jane Marie Cox, with whom he had three children. He adopted his nephews after his sister died of cancer and her husband was killed in a train accident. He and his wife both attended the [[University of Chicago]], while he worked as a night reporter for the [[City News Bureau of Chicago|City News Bureau]].

Vonnegut published his first novel, ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'', in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively but was not commercially successful at the time. In the nearly 20 years that followed, he published several novels that were well regarded, two of which (''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' [1959] and ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' [1963]) were nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for best novel. He published a short story collection titled ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' in 1968. His breakthrough was his commercially and critically successful sixth novel, ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969). The book's anti-war sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' went to the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and commencement addresses around the country, and received many awards and honors.

Later in his career, Vonnegut published several autobiographical essays and short-story collections such as ''[[Fates Worse Than Death]]'' (1991) and ''[[A Man Without a Country]]'' (2005). After his death, he was hailed as one of the most important contemporary writers and a [[Black comedy|dark humor]] commentator on American society. His son [[Mark Vonnegut|Mark]] published a compilation of his unpublished works, titled ''[[Armageddon in Retrospect]]'', in 2008. In 2017, [[Seven Stories Press]] published [[Complete Stories (Vonnegut)|''Complete Stories'']], a collection of Vonnegut's short fiction including five previously unpublished stories. ''Complete Stories'' was collected and introduced by Vonnegut friends and scholars Jerome Klinkowitz and [[Dan Wakefield]]. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.

== Biography ==
=== Family and early life ===
Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was born in [[Indianapolis]] on November 11, 1922, the youngest of three children of [[Kurt Vonnegut Sr.]] and his wife Edith (née Lieber). His older siblings were [[Bernard Vonnegut|Bernard]] (born 1914) and Alice (born 1917). He was descended from German immigrants who settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his paternal great-grandfather, [[Clemens Vonnegut]], settled in Indianapolis and founded the [[Vonnegut Hardware Company]]. His father and grandfather [[Bernard Vonnegut I|Bernard]] were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt Sr. designed such buildings as [[Athenæum (Das Deutsche Haus)|Das Deutsche Haus]] (now called "The Athenæum"), the Indiana headquarters of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], and the [[Fletcher Trust Building]].&lt;ref name="BoomhowerFarrell4-5" /&gt; Vonnegut's mother was born into Indianapolis high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city with their fortune deriving from ownership of a successful brewery.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=2}}

Both of Vonnegut's parents were fluent German speakers, but the ill feeling toward Germany during and after [[World War I]] caused them to abandon German culture in order to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach Vonnegut to speak German or introduce him to German literature and traditions, leaving him feeling "ignorant and rootless."&lt;ref name="Sharp1360"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|2006|p=1360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvin2Farrell3-4"&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper during the first decade of his life, for raising him and giving him values; he said that she "gave [him] decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to [him]," and "was as great an influence on [him] as anybody." He described her as "humane and wise" and added that "the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs" came from her.&lt;ref name="Marvin4"&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts had once enjoyed were destroyed in a matter of years. The Liebers' brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. When the [[Great Depression]] hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1360}} Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in [[private school]]s, but Vonnegut was placed in a [[state school|public school]] called Public School No. 43 (now the [[James Whitcomb Riley]] School).&lt;ref name="Boomhower"&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was bothered by the Great Depression,{{efn|In fact, Vonnegut often described himself as a "child of the Great Depression." He also stated the Depression and its effects incited pessimism about the validity of the [[American Dream]].&lt;ref name="Sumner"&gt;{{harvnb|Sumner|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a "dreamy artist."&lt;ref name="Sharp1360Marvin2-3"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|2006|p=1360}}; {{harvnb|Marvin|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said that she expressed hatred for her husband that was "as corrosive as [[hydrochloric acid]]."&lt;ref name="Marvin2-3"&gt;{{harvnb|Marvin|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She unsuccessfully tried to sell short stories she had written to ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', and other magazines.&lt;ref name="Sharp1360" /&gt;

=== High school and Cornell ===
[[File:Kurt Vonnegut - High School Yearbook.PNG|thumb|upright|Vonnegut as a teenager, from the [[Shortridge High School]] 1940 yearbook]]
Vonnegut enrolled at [[Shortridge High School]] in Indianapolis in 1936. While there, he played [[clarinet]] in the school band and became a co-editor (along with [[Madelyn Pugh]]) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, ''The Shortridge Echo''. Vonnegut said his tenure with the ''Echo'' allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was "fun and easy."&lt;ref name="BoomhowerFarrell4-5" /&gt; "It just turned out that I could write better than a lot of other people," Vonnegut observed. "Each person has something he can do easily and can't imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it."&lt;ref name="Boomhower" /&gt;

After graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut enrolled at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]. He wanted to study the [[humanities]] or become an architect like his father, but his father{{efn|Kurt Sr. was embittered by his lack of work as an architect during the Great Depression, and feared a similar fate for his son. He dismissed his son's desired areas of study as "junk jewellery," and persuaded his son against following in his footsteps.&lt;ref name="Farrell5Boomhower" /&gt;}} and brother Bernard, an atmospheric scientist, urged him to study a "useful" discipline.&lt;ref name="BoomhowerFarrell4-5"&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Vonnegut majored in [[biochemistry]], but he had little proficiency in the area and was indifferent towards his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sumner|2014}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his father had been a member at [[MIT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was entitled to join the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity, and did.&lt;ref name="Lowery2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowery|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overcame stiff competition for a place at the university's independent newspaper, ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'', first serving as a [[staff writer]], then as an editor.&lt;ref name="Farrell5"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his first year, he was writing a column titled "Innocents Abroad" which reused jokes from other publications. He later penned a piece, "Well All Right," focusing on [[pacifism]], a cause he strongly supported,&lt;ref name="Boomhower" /&gt; arguing against U.S. intervention in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Kurt-Vonnegut-US-Army-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vonnegut in army uniform during [[World War II]]]]
The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought the U.S. into the war. Vonnegut was a member of [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]], but poor grades and a satirical article in Cornell's newspaper cost him his place there. He was placed on [[academic probation]] in May 1942 and dropped out the following January. No longer eligible for a deferment as a member of ROTC, he faced likely [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] into the [[United States Army]]. Instead of waiting to be drafted, he enlisted in the Army and in March 1943 reported to [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, for basic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was trained to fire and maintain [[howitzer]]s and later received instruction in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Tennessee]] as part of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP).&lt;ref name="Farrell5Boomhower"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1944, the ASTP was canceled due to the Army's need for soldiers to support [[Operation Overlord|the D-Day invasion]], and Vonnegut was ordered to an infantry battalion at [[Camp Atterbury]], south of Indianapolis in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], where he trained as a scout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived so close to his home that he was "able to sleep in [his] own bedroom and use the family car on weekends".{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=6}} On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave for [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] weekend to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous night by [[drug overdose|overdosing on sleeping pills]].&lt;ref name="Farrell6"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors that contributed to Edith Vonnegut's suicide include the family's loss of wealth and status, Vonnegut's forthcoming deployment overseas, and her own lack of success as a writer. She was [[drunk|inebriated]] at the time and under the influence of prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="Farrell6" /&gt;

Three months after his mother's suicide, Vonnegut was sent to Europe as an intelligence scout with the [[106th Infantry Division (United States)|106th Infantry Division]]. In December 1944, he fought in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the final German offensive of the war.&lt;ref name="Farrell6" /&gt; During the battle, the 106th Infantry Division, which had only recently reached the front and was assigned to a "quiet" sector due to its inexperience, was overrun by advancing German armored forces. Over 500 members of the division were killed and over 6,000 were captured.

On December 22, Vonnegut was captured with about 50 other American soldiers.&lt;ref name="Sharp1363Farrell6"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|2006|p=1363}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was taken by [[boxcar]] to a prison camp south of [[Dresden]], in [[Saxony]]. During the journey, the Royal Air Force mistakenly attacked the trains carrying Vonnegut and his fellow [[prisoners of war]], killing about 150 of them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Vonnegut|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut was sent to Dresden, the "first fancy city [he had] ever seen." He lived in a slaughterhouse when he got to the city, and worked in a factory that made [[malt syrup]] for pregnant women. Vonnegut recalled the sirens going off whenever another city was bombed. The Germans did not expect Dresden to be bombed, Vonnegut said. "There were very few air-raid shelters in town and no war industries, just cigarette factories, hospitals, clarinet factories."&lt;ref name="TheParisReview"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0309-310, Zerstörtes Dresden.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dresden]] in 1945. More than 90 percent of the city's center was destroyed.]]
On February 13, 1945, Dresden became the target of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a fierce [[bombing of Dresden|firebombing of the city]].&lt;ref name="Farrell6" /&gt; The offensive subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled at the level of both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground.&lt;ref name="Boomhower" /&gt; "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. "When we came up the city was gone&amp;nbsp;... They burnt the whole damn town down."&lt;ref name="TheParisReview" /&gt; Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the activity as a "terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt".&lt;ref name="TheParisReview" /&gt;

The American POWs were evacuated on foot to the border of Saxony and [[Czechoslovakia]] after US General [[George S. Patton]] captured [[Leipzig]]. With the captives abandoned by their guards, Vonnegut reached a prisoner-of-war repatriation camp in [[Le Havre]], France, before the end of May 1945, with the aid of the Soviets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He returned to the United States and continued to serve in the Army, stationed at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], typing discharge papers for other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Vonnegut |first=Kurt |interviewer=[[Michael Silverblatt]] |title="Kurt Vonnegut" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=538&amp;v=4bclBnx4cpk |publisher=KCRW |location=Santa Monica, California|date=April 6, 2006 |work=Bookworm |access-date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after he was awarded a [[Purple Heart]], about which he remarked: "I myself was awarded my country's second-lowest decoration, a Purple Heart for [[frost-bite]]."&lt;ref name="DaltonSEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalton|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from the U.S. Army and returned to Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|2006|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage, University of Chicago, and early employment ===
After he returned to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]] on the [[G.I. Bill]], as an [[anthropology]] student in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that conferred a [[master's degree]]. He augmented his income by working as a reporter for the [[City News Bureau of Chicago]] at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study [[Russian literature]] as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, [[Mark Vonnegut|Mark]] (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on the [[Ghost Dance]] religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.{{efn|Vonnegut received his graduate degree in anthropology 25 years after he left, when the University accepted his novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' in lieu of his master's thesis.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=7}}}}

Shortly thereafter, [[General Electric]] (GE) hired Vonnegut as a technical writer, then publicist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noble |first=David |date=2017 |title="Forces of Production: A Social History of Industrial Automation." |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/forces-of-production-a-social-history-of-industrial-automation/oclc/1015814093 |publisher=ROUTLEDGE |page=166 |isbn=9781138523647 | quote="In the early 1950s novelist Kurt Vonnegut was a technical writer and publicist at GE headquarters in Schenectady."}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for the company's [[Schenectady, New York]], research laboratory. Although his work required a college degree, Vonnegut was hired after claiming to hold a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Chicago. His brother Bernard had worked at GE since 1945, contributing significantly to an [[iodine]]-based [[cloud seeding]] project. In 1949, Kurt and Jane had a daughter named [[Edith Vonnegut|Edith]]. Still working for GE, Vonnegut had his first piece, titled "Report on the Barnhouse Effect," published in the February 11, 1950 issue of ''Collier's'', for which he received $750.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Sumner|2014}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnegut wrote another story, after being coached by the fiction editor at ''Collier's'', Knox Burger, and again sold it to the magazine, this time for $950. While Burger supported Vonnegut's writing, he was shocked when Vonnegut quit GE as of January 1, 1951, later stating: "I never said he should give up his job and devote himself to fiction.  I don't trust the freelancer's life, it's tough."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in early 1951 Vonnegut moved with his family to [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]], to write full time, leaving GE behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First novel ===

In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'', was published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers have been replaced by machines.&lt;ref name = "player" /&gt;

''Player Piano'' draws upon Vonnegut's experience as an employee at GE. He satirizes the drive to climb the corporate ladder, one that in ''Player Piano'' is rapidly disappearing as automation increases, putting even executives out of work. His central character, Paul Proteus, has an ambitious wife, a backstabbing assistant, and a feeling of empathy for the poor. Sent by his boss, Kroner, as a double agent among the poor (who have all the material goods they want, but little sense of purpose), he leads them in a machine-smashing, museum-burning revolution.&lt;ref name = "playerp" /&gt; ''Player Piano'' expresses Vonnegut's opposition to [[McCarthyism]], something made clear when the Ghost Shirts, the revolutionary organization Paul penetrates and eventually leads, is referred to by one character as "[[fellow travelers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Player Piano'', Vonnegut originates many of the techniques he would use in his later works. The comic, heavy-drinking Shah of Bratpuhr, an outsider to this dystopian corporate United States, is able to ask many questions that an insider would not think to ask, or would cause offense by doing so. For example, when taken to see the artificially intelligent supercomputer EPICAC, the Shah asks it "what are people for?" and receives no answer. Speaking for Vonnegut, he dismisses it as a "false god". This type of alien visitor would recur throughout Vonnegut's literature.&lt;ref name="playerp"&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|pp = 20–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' writer and critic [[Granville Hicks]] gave ''Player Piano'' a positive review, favorably comparing it to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Hicks called Vonnegut a "sharp-eyed satirist". None of the reviewers considered the novel particularly important. Several editions were printed—one by [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] with the title ''Utopia 14'', and another by the [[Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club]]—whereby Vonnegut gained the repute of a [[science fiction]] writer, a genre held in disdain by writers at that time. He defended the genre, and deplored a perceived sentiment that "no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and understand how a refrigerator works."&lt;ref name = "player"&gt;{{harvnb|Boomhower|1999}}; {{harvnb|Farrell|2009|pp=8–9}}; {{harvnb|Marvin|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Struggling writer ===
[[File:Vonnegut and family large.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Vonnegut with his wife Jane, and children (from left to right): Mark, Edith and Nanette, in 1955]]

After ''Player Piano'', Vonnegut continued to sell short stories to various magazines.  Contracted to produce a second novel (which eventually became ''Cat's Cradle''), he struggled to complete it and the work languished for years.  In 1954 the couple had a third child, Nanette. With a growing family and no financially successful novels yet, Vonnegut's short stories helped to sustain the family, though he frequently needed to find additional sources of income as well.  In 1957, he and a partner opened a [[Saab automobile]] dealership in Cape Cod, but it went bankrupt by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, his sister, Alice, died of cancer two days after her husband, James Carmalt Adams, was killed in [[Newark Bay rail accident|a train accident]]. The Vonneguts took in three of the Adams' young sons—James, Steven, and Kurt, aged 14, 11, and 9, respectively.&lt;ref name="Farrell9"&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth Adams son, Peter (2), also stayed with the Vonneguts for about a year before being given to the care of a paternal relative in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grappling with family challenges, Vonnegut continued to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar in terms of plot. ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'' (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp that allows him to appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet [[Tralfamadore]], who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as [[the Kremlin]], are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach's]] opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumfoord, who is based on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], also physically resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described, "he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Rodney Allen]], in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' and ''Jailbird''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mother Night]]'', published in 1961, received little attention at the time of its publication. Howard W. Campbell Jr., Vonnegut's protagonist, is an American who is raised in Germany from age 11 and joins the Nazi party during the war as a double agent for the U.S. [[Office of Strategic Services]], and rises to the regime's highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as [[Adolf Eichmann]], and later commits suicide. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition, "we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', to illustrate the tendency for "impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morse|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also published in 1961 was Vonnegut's short story, "[[Harrison Bergeron]]", set in a dystopic future where all are equal, even if that means disfiguring beautiful people and forcing the strong or intelligent to wear devices that negate their advantages. Fourteen-year-old Harrison is a genius and athlete forced to wear record-level "handicaps" and imprisoned for attempting to overthrow the government. He escapes to a television studio, tears away his handicaps, and frees a ballerina from her lead weights. As they dance, they are killed by the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=46}} Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that "Harrison Bergeron" might have sprung from his envy and self-pity as a high school misfit. In his 1976 biography of Vonnegut, Stanley Schatt suggested that the short story shows "in any leveling process, what really is lost, according to Vonnegut, is beauty, grace, and wisdom".{{sfn|Hattenhauer|1998|p=387}} Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on "Harrison Bergeron", theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War misunderstandings of communism and socialism.{{sfn|Hattenhauer|1998|p=387}}

With ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' (1963), Allen wrote, "Vonnegut hit full stride for the first time".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator, John, intends to write of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the fictional fathers of the atomic bomb, seeking to cover the scientist's human side. Hoenikker, in addition to the bomb, has developed another threat to mankind, ice-nine, solid water stable at room temperature, and if a particle of it is dropped in water, all of it becomes ice-nine. Much of the second half of the book is spent on the fictional Caribbean island of San Lorenzo, where John explores a religion called [[Bokononism]], whose holy books (excerpts from which are quoted) give the novel the moral core science does not supply. After the oceans are converted to ice-nine, wiping out most of humankind, John wanders the frozen surface, seeking to have himself and his story survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|pp=54–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morse|2003|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vonnegut based the title character of ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'' (1964), on an accountant he knew on Cape Cod, who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a [[volunteer fire department]], and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers, and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shields|2011|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen deemed ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'' more "a cry from the heart than a novel under its author's full intellectual control", that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|1991|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, Vonnegut contemplated abandoning his writing career. In 1999 he wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "I had gone broke, was out of print and had a lot of kids..." But then, on the recommendation of an admirer, he received a surprise offer of a teaching job at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], employment that he likened to the rescue of a drowning man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/library/books/052499vonnegut-writing.html |title=Writers on Writing: Despite Tough Guys, Life is Not the Only School for Real Novelists |last=Vonnegut |first=Kurt |date=May 24, 1999 |website=The New York Times |access-date=2020-01-02 |ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' ===

{{main|Slaughterhouse-Five}}
After spending almost two years at [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|the writer's workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]], teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At the time of the bombing, Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he came to believe that 135,000 had died there.{{sfn|Shields|2011|pp=219–228}}{{efn|A 2010 report commissioned by the German government estimated the toll at up to 25,000.{{sfn|BBC|2010}}}}

Vonnegut had been writing about his war experiences at Dresden ever since he returned from the war, but had never been able to write anything acceptable to himself or his publishers—Chapter 1 of ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' tells of his difficulties.{{sfn|Allen|pp=82–85}} Released in 1969, the novel rocketed Vonnegut to fame.{{sfn|Shields|2011|pp=248–249}} It tells of the life of Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnegut was born in 1922 and survives the bombing of Dresden. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story's climaxes—Billy's death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy's friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot—disclosed in the story's first pages.{{sfn|Allen|pp=82–85}} In 1970, he was also a correspondent in [[Biafra]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKdcCgk_FowC&amp;pg=PA12|page=12|title=Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five|series=Bloom's Guides|author=Harold Bloom|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-438-1270-95|author-link=Harold Bloom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_T6j421tM4C&amp;pg=PA55|title=Kurt Vonnegut's America|author=Jerome Klinkowitz|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-570-0382-66|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Slaughterhouse-Five'' received generally positive reviews, with [[Michael Crichton]] writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', "he writes about the most excruciatingly painful things. His novels have attacked our deepest fears of automation and the bomb, our deepest political guilts, our fiercest hatreds and loves. No one else writes books on these subjects; they are inaccessible to normal novelists."{{sfn|Shields|2011|p=254}} The book went immediately to the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. Vonnegut's earlier works had appealed strongly to many college students, and the antiwar message of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' resonated with a generation marked by the [[Vietnam War]]. He later stated that the loss of confidence in government that Vietnam caused finally allowed for an honest conversation regarding events like Dresden.{{sfn|Shields|2011|pp=248–249}}

=== Later career and life ===
After ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' was published, Vonnegut embraced the fame and financial security that attended its release. He was hailed as a hero of the burgeoning anti-war movement in the United States, was invited to speak at numerous rallies, and gave college [[commencement address]]es around the country.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=10}} In addition to briefly teaching at [[Harvard University]] as a lecturer in [[creative writing]] in 1970, Vonnegut taught at the [[City College of New York]] as a distinguished professor during the 1973–1974 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002675801|title=Marquis Biographies Online|website=Search.marquiswhoswho.com|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later elected vice president of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], and given honorary degrees by, among others, [[Indiana University]] and [[Bennington College]]. Vonnegut also wrote a play called ''[[Happy Birthday, Wanda June]]'', which opened on October 7, 1970, at New York's [[Theatre de Lys]]. Receiving mixed reviews, it closed on March 14, 1971. In 1972, [[Universal Pictures]] adapted ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' into [[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|a film]] which the author said was "flawless".{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}}

Meanwhile, Vonnegut's personal life was disintegrating. His wife Jane had embraced Christianity, which was contrary to Vonnegut's atheistic beliefs, and with five of their six children having left home, Vonnegut said the two were forced to find "other sorts of seemingly important work to do". The couple battled over their differing beliefs until Vonnegut moved from their Cape Cod home to New York in 1971. Vonnegut called the disagreements "painful", and said the resulting split was a "terrible, unavoidable accident that we were ill-equipped to understand."{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=10}} The couple divorced and they remained friends until Jane's death in late 1986.{{sfn|Wolff|1987}}{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=10}} Beyond his marriage, he was deeply affected when his son Mark suffered a [[mental breakdown]] in 1972, which exacerbated Vonnegut's chronic depression, and led him to take [[Ritalin]]. When he stopped taking the drug in the mid-1970s, he began to see a psychologist weekly.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}}

|salign=right|source=— Kurt Vonnegut, &lt;small&gt;''[[A Man Without a Country]]'', 2005&lt;/small&gt;}}

Vonnegut's difficulties materialized in numerous ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress he was making on his next novel, the darkly comical ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]''. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}} When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book ''American Literature on Stage and Screen'', ''Breakfast of Champions'' was called "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it "lacks substance and seems to be an exercise in literary playfulness."{{sfn|Hischak|2012|p=31}} Vonnegut's 1976 novel ''[[Slapstick (novel)|Slapstick]]'', which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In ''The New York Times''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s review of ''Slapstick'', [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] said Vonnegut "seems to be putting less effort into [storytelling] than ever before", and that "it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all."{{sfn|Lehmann-Haupt|1976}} At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=11}}

In 1979, Vonnegut married [[Jill Krementz]], a photographer whom he met while she was working on a series about writers in the early 1970s. With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old.{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=451}} In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including ''[[Jailbird (novel)|Jailbird]]'' (1979), ''[[Deadeye Dick]]'' (1982), ''[[Galápagos (novel)|Galápagos]]'' (1985), ''[[Bluebeard (Vonnegut novel)|Bluebeard]]'' (1987), and ''[[Hocus Pocus (novel)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Sumner|2014}} Although he remained a prolific writer in the 1980s Vonnegut struggled with depression and attempted suicide in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Vonnegut|title=Kurt Vonnegut {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Books|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s film ''[[Back to School]]''.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=12}} The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, ''[[Timequake]]'' (1997), was, as [[University of Detroit]] history professor and Vonnegut biographer [[Gregory Sumner]] said, "a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency."{{sfn|Sumner|2014}} Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled ''[[A Man Without a Country]]'' (2005), became a bestseller.{{sfn|Smith|2007}}

=== Death and legacy ===
{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=Vonnegut's sincerity, his willingness to scoff at received wisdom, is such that reading his work for the first time gives one the sense that everything else is rank hypocrisy. His opinion of human nature was low, and that low opinion applied to his heroes and his villains alike—he was endlessly disappointed in humanity and in himself, and he expressed that disappointment in a mixture of tar-black humor and deep despair. He could easily have become a crank, but he was too smart; he could have become a cynic, but there was something tender in his nature that he could never quite suppress; he could have become a bore, but even at his most despairing he had an endless willingness to entertain his readers: with drawings, jokes, sex, bizarre plot twists, science fiction, whatever it took.{{sfn|Grossman|2007}}|source=– [[Lev Grossman]], &lt;small&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 2007&lt;/small&gt;}}

In a 2006 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Vonnegut sardonically stated that he would sue the [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] tobacco company, the maker of the [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]]-branded cigarettes he had been smoking since he was around 12 or 14 years old, for false advertising: "And do you know why? Because I'm 83 years old. The lying bastards! On the package Brown &amp; Williamson promised to kill me."{{sfn|Grossman|2007}} He died in the [[Manhattan]] borough of [[New York City]] on the night of April 11, 2007, as a result of brain injuries incurred several weeks prior from a fall at his [[brownstone]] home.{{sfn|Smith|2007}}{{sfn|Allen}} His death was reported by his wife Jill. He was 84 years old.{{sfn|Smith|2007}} At the time of his death, he had written 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five non-fiction books.{{sfn|Grossman|2007}} A book composed of his unpublished pieces, ''[[Armageddon in Retrospect]]'', was compiled and posthumously published by his son Mark in 2008.{{sfn|Blount|2008}}

When asked about the impact Vonnegut had on his work, author [[Josip Novakovich]] stated that he has "much to learn from Vonnegut—how to compress things and yet not compromise them, how to digress into history, quote from various historical accounts, and not stifle the narrative. The ease with which he writes is sheerly masterly, Mozartian."{{sfn|Banach|2013}} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist Gregory Rodriguez said that the author will "rightly be remembered as a darkly humorous social critic and the premier novelist of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]",{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007}} and [[Dinitia Smith]] of ''The New York Times'' dubbed Vonnegut the "counterculture's novelist".{{sfn|Smith|2007}}

Vonnegut has inspired numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cofc.edu/vonnegut/|title=The Kurt Vonnegut Society – Promoting the Scholarly Study of Kurt Vonnegut, his Life, and Works|website=Blogs.cofc.edu|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and in November 2010, the [[Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library]] was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The [[Library of America]] published a compendium of Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's ''Unstuck in Time'' and [[Charles J. Shields]]'s ''And So It Goes''.{{sfn|Kunze|Tally|2012|p=7}} Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. "Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s Wendy Smith. "Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the [[University of Northern Iowa]], who has examined Vonnegut in depth.{{sfn|Harris|2011}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=Like Mark Twain, Mr. Vonnegut used humor to tackle the basic questions of human existence: Why are we in this world? Is there a presiding figure to make sense of all this, a god who in the end, despite making people suffer, wishes them well?{{sfn|Smith|2007}}|source=–Dinitia Smith, &lt;small&gt;''The New York Times'', 2007&lt;/small&gt;}}

Vonnegut's works have evoked ire on several occasions. His most prominent novel, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'', has been objected to or removed at various institutions in at least 18 instances.{{sfn|Morais|2011}} In the case of ''[[Island Trees School District v. Pico]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that [[Island Trees Union Free School District|a school district's]] ban on ''Slaughterhouse-Five''—which the board had called "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy"—and eight other novels was unconstitutional. When a school board in [[Republic, Missouri]] decided to withdraw Vonnegut's novel from its libraries, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.{{sfn|Morais|2011}}

Tally, writing in 2013, suggests that Vonnegut has only recently become the subject of serious study rather than fan adulation, and much is yet to be written about him. "The time for scholars to say 'Here's why Vonnegut is worth reading' has definitively ended, thank goodness. We know he's worth reading. Now tell us things we don't know."{{sfn|Tally|2013|pp=14–15}} Todd F. Davis notes that Vonnegut's work is kept alive by his loyal readers, who have "significant influence as they continue to purchase Vonnegut's work, passing it on to subsequent generations and keeping his entire canon in print—an impressive list of more than twenty books that [Dell Publishing] has continued to refurbish and hawk with new cover designs."{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=2}} Donald E. Morse notes that Vonnegut, "is now firmly, if somewhat controversially, ensconced in the American and world literary canon as well as in high school, college and graduate curricula".{{sfn|Morse|2013|p=56}} Tally writes of Vonnegut's work:

{{quote|Vonnegut's 14 novels, while each does its own thing, together are nevertheless experiments in the same overall project. Experimenting with the form of the American novel itself, Vonnegut engages in a broadly modernist attempt to apprehend and depict the fragmented, unstable, and distressing bizarreries of postmodern American experience&amp;nbsp;... That he does not actually succeed in representing the shifting multiplicities of that social experience is beside the point. What matters is the attempt, and the recognition that&amp;nbsp;... we must try to map this unstable and perilous terrain, even if we know in advance that our efforts are doomed.{{sfn|Tally|2011|p=158}}}}

=== War ===
In the introduction to ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' Vonnegut recounts meeting the film producer Harrison Starr at a party who asked him whether his forthcoming book was an anti-war novel—"I guess", replied Vonnegut. Starr responded "Why don't you write an anti-glacier novel?" This underlined Vonnegut's belief that wars were, unfortunately, inevitable, but that it was important to ensure the wars one fought were [[Just war theory|just wars]].
[[File:Mass Ave.jpg|thumb|alt=A large painting of Vonnegut on the side of a building|A large painting of Vonnegut on [[Massachusetts Avenue, Indianapolis]], blocks away from the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and the Rathskeller, which was designed by his family's architecture firm.]]

In 2011, [[NPR]] wrote, "Kurt Vonnegut's blend of anti-war sentiment and satire made him one of the most popular writers of the 1960s." Vonnegut stated in a 1987 interview that, "my own feeling is that civilization ended in [[World War I]], and we're still trying to recover from that", and that he wanted to write war-focused works without glamorizing war itself.{{sfn|NPR|2011}} Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] led him to write ''A Man Without a Country''.{{sfn|Daily Telegraph 2007}}

''Slaughterhouse-Five'' is the Vonnegut novel best known for its antiwar themes, but the author expressed his beliefs in ways beyond the depiction of the destruction of Dresden. One character, Mary O'Hare, opines that "wars were partly encouraged by books and movies", starring "[[Frank Sinatra]] or [[John Wayne]] or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men".{{sfn|Freese|2013|p=101}} Vonnegut made a number of comparisons between Dresden and the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] in ''Slaughterhouse-Five''{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=2}} and wrote in ''Palm Sunday'' (1991) that "I learned how vile that religion of mine could be when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima".{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=68}}

[[Nuclear war]], or at least deployed [[nuclear arms]], is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In ''Player Piano'', the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In ''Cat's Cradle'', John's original purpose in setting pen to paper was to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|pp=1–2}}

Vonnegut was an [[atheist]], a [[Humanism|humanist]] and a [[freethought|freethinker]], serving as the honorary president of the [[American Humanist Association]].{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|pp=177, 185, 191}}{{sfn|Niose|2007}} In an interview for ''[[Playboy]]'', he stated that his forebears who came to the United States did not believe in God, and he learned his atheism from his parents.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=480}} He did not, however, disdain those who seek the comfort of religion, hailing church associations as a type of extended family.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}} He occasionally attended a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church, but with little consistency. In his autobiographical work ''Palm Sunday'', Vonnegut says he is a "Christ-worshipping agnostic";{{sfn|Vonnegut|1982|p=327}} in a speech to the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], he called himself a "Christ-loving atheist". However, he was keen to stress that he was not a Christian.&lt;ref name=image&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wakefield|first1=Dan|author-link=Dan Wakefield|date=2014|title=Kurt Vonnegut, Christ-Loving Atheist|url= https://www.imagejournal.org/article/kurt-vonnegut/|journal=[[Image (journal)|Image]]|issue=82|pages=67–75|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vonnegut was an admirer of Jesus' [[Sermon on the Mount]], particularly the [[Beatitudes]], and incorporated it into his own doctrines.{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=142}} He also referred to it in many of his works.{{sfn|Vonnegut|2006b}} In his 1991 book ''Fates Worse than Death'', Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, "anything that sounded like the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American".{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=525}} In ''Palm Sunday'', he wrote that "the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade."{{sfn|Leeds|1995|p=525}} However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the [[televangelist]]s of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=141}}

Religion features frequently in Vonnegut's work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced a number of his speeches with religion-focused [[rhetoric]],{{sfn|Vonnegut|1999|loc=introduction}}{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|pp=177, 185, 191}} and was prone to using such expressions as "God forbid" and "thank God".{{sfn|Niose|2007}}{{sfn|Vonnegut|2009|p=191}} He once wrote his own version of the [[Requiem Mass]], which he then had translated into Latin and set to music.&lt;ref name=image/&gt; In ''[[God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian]]'', Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is [[euthanasia|euthanized]] by Dr. [[Jack Kevorkian]]. Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including [[Isaac Asimov]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Kilgore Trout]]—the last a fictional character from several of his novels.{{sfn|Kohn|2001}} Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths,{{sfn|Farrell|2009|p=141}} and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in ''Player Piano'', ''The Sirens of Titan'' and ''Cat's Cradle''. In ''The Sirens of Titan'', Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and displaying a large crucifix on his bedroom wall.{{sfn|Leeds|1995|pp=477–479}} In ''Cat's Cradle'', Vonnegut invented the religion of [[Bokononism]].{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=78}}

=== Politics ===
Vonnegut did not particularly sympathize with [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]], and mused on the specious simplicity of [[American politics]], saying facetiously, "If you want to take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other ... you're a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative. What could be simpler?"{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2009|p=620}} Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said, "The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don't acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead."{{sfn|Vonnegut|2006a|loc="In a Manner that Must Shame God Himself"}}

Vonnegut disregarded more mainstream political ideologies in favor of [[socialism]], which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for what he saw as [[social Darwinism]] and a spirit of "[[survival of the fittest]]" in American society,{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1364–1365}} believing that "socialism would be a good for the common man".{{sfn|Gannon|Taylor|2013}} Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate [[Eugene V. Debs]]: "As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free."{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}}{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2009|p=618}} Vonnegut expressed disappointment that [[communism]] and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American, and believed that they may offer beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}}

== Writing ==
[[File:VonnegutLibrary.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library|Vonnegut Museum and Library]], Indianapolis]]

=== Influences ===
Vonnegut's writing was inspired by an eclectic mix of sources. When he was younger, Vonnegut stated that he read works of [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], science fiction, fantasy, and action-adventure. He also read the [[classics]], such as the plays of [[Aristophanes]]—like Vonnegut's works, humorous critiques of contemporary society.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=17–18}} Vonnegut's life and work also share similarities with that of ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' writer [[Mark Twain]]. Both shared pessimistic outlooks on humanity, and a skeptical take on religion, and, as Vonnegut put it, were both "associated with the enemy in a major war", as Twain briefly enlisted in the South's cause during the [[American Civil War]], and Vonnegut's German name and ancestry connected him with the United States' enemy in both world wars.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=18}} He also cited [[Ambrose Bierce]] as an influence, calling [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]] the greatest American short story and deeming any who disagreed or had not read the story 'twerps.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/43797-i-consider-anybody-a-twerp-who-hasn-t-read-the-greatest|title=A quote by Kurt Vonnegut|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2019-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vonnegut called [[George Orwell]] his favorite writer, and admitted that he tried to emulate Orwell. "I like his concern for the poor, I like his socialism, I like his simplicity", Vonnegut said.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Vonnegut also said that Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', and ''Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley, heavily influenced his [[debut novel]], ''Player Piano'', in 1952. Vonnegut commented that [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works that he tried to mimic in his own compositions.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}} Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist [[George Bernard Shaw]] as "a hero of [his]", and an "enormous influence".{{sfn|Barsamian|2004|p=15}} Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him. "[My] mother thought she might make a new fortune by writing for the slick magazines. She took short-story courses at night. She studied writers the way gamblers study horses."{{sfn|Hayman|Michaelis|Plimpton|Rhodes|1977}}

Early on in his career, Vonnegut decided to model his style after [[Henry David Thoreau]], who wrote as if from the perspective of a child, allowing Thoreau's works to be more widely comprehensible.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=18}} Using a youthful narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and straightforward way.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=18–19}} Other influences on Vonnegut include ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' author [[H. G. Wells]], and satirist [[Jonathan Swift]]. Vonnegut credited American journalist and critic [[H. L. Mencken]] for inspiring him to become a journalist.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}

=== Style and technique ===
{{quote box|width=36%|align=right|quote=I've heard the Vonnegut voice described as "manic depressive", and there's certainly something to this. It has an incredible amount of energy married to a very deep and dark sense of despair. It's frequently over-the-top, and scathingly satirical, but it never strays too far from pathos—from an immense sympathy for society's vulnerable, oppressed and powerless. But, then, it also contains a huge allotment of warmth. Most of the time, reading Kurt Vonnegut feels more like being spoken to by a very close friend. There's an inclusiveness to his writing that draws you in, and his narrative voice is seldom absent from the story for any length of time. Usually, it's right there in the foreground—direct, involving and extremely idiosyncratic.{{sfn|Extence|2013}}|source=–[[Gavin Extence]], &lt;small&gt;''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 2013&lt;/small&gt;}}

In his book ''Popular Contemporary Writers'', Michael D. Sharp describes Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter in a way that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations.{{sfn|Extence|2013}}{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Slapstick''.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1363–1364}}

Vonnegut believed that ideas, and the convincing communication of those ideas to the reader, were vital to literary art. He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of ''Player Piano'' leads up to the moment when Paul, on trial and hooked up to a lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood, and states, "every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity".{{sfn|Davis|2006|pp=45–46}} Robert T. Tally Jr., in his volume on Vonnegut's novels, wrote, "rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness."{{sfn|Tally|2011|p=157}} Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society, but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety. The large artificial families that the U.S. population is formed into in ''Slapstick'' soon serve as an excuse for tribalism, with people giving no help to those not part of their group, and with the extended family's place in the social hierarchy becoming vital.{{sfn|Tally|2011|pp=103–105}}

In the introduction to their essay "Kurt Vonnegut and Humor", Tally and Peter C. Kunze suggest that Vonnegut was not a "[[Black comedy|black humorist]]", but a "frustrated idealist" who used "comic parables" to teach the reader absurd, bitter or hopeless truths, with his grim witticisms serving to make the reader laugh rather than cry. "Vonnegut makes sense through humor, which is, in the author's view, as valid a means of mapping this crazy world as any other strategies."{{sfn|Kunze|Tally|2012|loc=introduction}} Vonnegut resented being called a black humorist, feeling that, as with many literary labels, it allows readers to disregard aspects of a writer's work that do not fit the label's stereotype.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=16}}

Vonnegut's works have, at various times, been labeled science fiction, [[satire]] and [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]].{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=13}} He also resisted such labels, but his works do contain common [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] that are often associated with those genres. In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction. Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=14–15}} Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems that plague societies, as is done in satirical works. However, literary theorist [[Robert Scholes]] noted in ''Fabulation and Metafiction'' that Vonnegut "reject[s] the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [He has] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter."{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=15}} Examples of [[postmodernism]] may also be found in Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths of the world will be discovered through science.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=16}} Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world. They often use [[unreliable narrator|unreliable]], [[first-person narration]], and narrative [[Postmodern literature#Fragmentation|fragmentation]]. One critic has argued that Vonnegut's most famous novel, ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', features a [[metafiction]]al, [[Janus|Janus-headed]] outlook as it seeks both to represent actual historical events while problematizing the very notion of doing exactly that. This is encapsulated in the opening lines of the novel: "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true." This bombastic opening—"All this happened"—"reads like a declaration of complete mimesis" which is radically called into question in the rest of the quote and "[t]his creates an integrated perspective that seeks out extratextual themes [like war and trauma] while thematizing the novel's textuality and inherent constructedness at one and the same time."{{sfn|Jensen|2016|pp=8–11}} While Vonnegut does use elements as fragmentation and metafictional elements, in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=16–17}}

=== Themes ===
Vonnegut was a vocal critic of American society, and this was reflected in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In ''The Sirens of Titan'', the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] as a result of his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|pp=19, 44–45}} In ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'', readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Further, in ''Hocus Pocus'', the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1364}} In ''Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion'', Thomas F. Marvin states: "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a "hereditary aristocracy" develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=19}} Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a "survival of the fittest" view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because "they deserve their fate".{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1364–1365}} Vonnegut also confronts the idea of [[free will]] in a number of his pieces. In ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Timequake'' the characters have no choice in what they do; in ''Breakfast of Champions'', characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in ''Cat's Cradle'', Bokononism views free will as [[heresy|heretical]].{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1366}}

The majority of Vonnegut's characters are estranged from their actual families and seek to build replacement or extended families. For example, the engineers in ''Player Piano'' called their manager's spouse "Mom". In ''Cat's Cradle'', Vonnegut devises two separate methods for loneliness to be combated: A "karass", which is a group of individuals appointed by God to do his will, and a "[[granfalloon]]", defined by Marvin as a "meaningless association of people, such as a fraternal group or a nation".{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=20}} Similarly, in ''Slapstick'', the U.S. government codifies that all Americans are a part of large extended families.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}}

Fear of the loss of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut witnessed machines being built to take the place of human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, ''Player Piano'', where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in ''Galápagos'', where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in ''Timequake'', where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|pp=1365–1366}}

Suicide by fire is another common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often returns to the theory that "many people are not fond of life." He uses this as an explanation for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as [[nuclear weapon]]s that can make their creators extinct.{{sfn|Sharp|2006|p=1365}} In ''Deadeye Dick'', Vonnegut features the [[neutron bomb]], which he claims is designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices at the disposal of politicians.{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=21}}

"What is the point of life?" is a question Vonnegut often pondered in his works. When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question "What is the purpose of life?" written in a bathroom, his response is, "To be the eyes and ears and [[conscience]] of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, "[as] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in." In the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to ''Bluebeard'', Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is."{{sfn|Marvin|2002|p=20}}
