'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s, for which she is referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]".

After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 at age 15. Her first two studio albums, certified diamond in the US, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000) were global successes and became two of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], along with making her the best-selling teenage artist of all time. The former's [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was named the greatest debut single of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2020 and the latter held a 15-year record for fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States with first-week sales of [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|over 1.3{{nbsp}}million copies]]. Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes and aesthetics for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002).

She became the executive producer of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=October 30, 2017|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|url-status=live|access-date=June 9, 2019|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a series of highly publicized personal struggles, promotion for the album was limited, and she was later involuntarily placed in a [[conservatorship]]. Since then, she released the chart-topping albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino]] in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016). In 2019, [[Conservatorship dispute of Britney Spears|Spears's legal battle over her conservatorship]] came to light; in 2021, she accused her management team and family of abuse and expressed a desire to terminate the arrangement, leading to the establishment of the [[Free Britney movement|#FreeBritney movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=April 28, 2021|title=Britney Spears asks to address court over conservatorship case|language=en-GB|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56911822|access-date=May 6, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spears has scored six number-one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref name="billboard_472190"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |access-date=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has four solo number-one singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]", "[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]", and "[[Hold It Against Me]]". As a featured artist, the "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]" remix also topped the ''Billboard'' chart. Other singles, "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]", and "[[Scream &amp; Shout]]", topped the charts in most countries. With "3" in 2009 and "Hold It Against Me" in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears's heavily choreographed videography is considered a focal point to the success of her career, for which she has been awarded the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]]. She has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Britney Spears|numerous awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]]; fifteen ''[[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Records]]''; six [[MTV Video Music Awards]]; seven [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

Regarded as a [[pop icon]], Spears has sold over 100{{nbsp}}million records worldwide, including over 70{{nbsp}}million solely in the United States, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8493258/britney-spears-career-sales-baby-one-more-time-20th-anniversary-ask-billboard|title=Ask Billboard: Britney Spears' Career Album &amp; Song Sales, on the 20th Anniversary of '...Baby One More Time' LIST|website=Billboard|access-date=February 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="records" /&gt; She was ranked by ''Billboard'' as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s decade.&lt;ref name="bbad" /&gt; In the United States, she is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] era&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6509510/ask-billboard-britney-spearss-career-sales|title=Ask Billboard: Britney Spears's Career Sales|website=Billboard|access-date=October 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.&lt;ref name="21sells" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/newswire/uploads/2010/01/Nielsen-Music-2009-Year-End-Press-Release.pdf|title=Nielsen SoundScan 2009 End Decade Report (Page 7)|website=Nielsen Soundscan|access-date=January 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412111503/https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/newswire/uploads/2010/01/Nielsen-Music-2009-Year-End-Press-Release.pdf|archive-date=April 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1632118/beyonce-nsync-outkast-top-decade-end-sales-list/|title=BEYONCE, 'NSYNC, OUTKAST TOP DECADE-END SALES LIST|website=MTV|access-date=January 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Spears launched a [[List of celebrity-branded perfumes|perfume brand]] with [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]]; sales exceeded $1.5{{nbsp}}billion {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Britney Spears 'X Factor' Deal: By The Numbers |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=October 5, 2012 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1684879/britney-spears-x-factor-deal-judge/ |access-date=June 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821051441/http://www.mtv.com/news/1684879/britney-spears-x-factor-deal-judge/ |archive-date=August 21, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' has reported Spears as the highest-paid female musician of 2002 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |date=December 12, 2012 |access-date=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also topped the list of most searched celebrities seven times in twelve years, a record since the inception of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/05/most-searched-celebrities-past-12-years-britney-spears_n_2244614.html|title=Most-Searched Celebrities Of The Past 12 Years: Britney Spears Dominates List|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===1981–1997: Early life and career beginnings===
Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981, in [[McComb, Mississippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=December 2, 1981: Britney Spears Was Born |url=https://www.mylifetime.com/she-did-that/december-2-1981-britney-spears-was-born |publisher=[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bsbiography/&gt; the second child of [[James Parnell Spears|James "Jamie" Parnell Spears]] and [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene Bridges]]. Her paternal grandmother, Emma Jean Spears, committed suicide when her father James was thirteen, on the grave of James's infant brother.&lt;ref name="pushed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/arts/music/britney-spears-conservatorship.html|title=Britney Spears Quietly Pushed for Years to End Her Conservatorship|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|pp=4, 8}}. "But on my mama's side, the family tree is a little more colorful and glamorous. Her father, my grandfather, was Anthony Portelli, who came from the island of Malta."&lt;/ref&gt; Her siblings are [[Bryan Spears|Bryan James]] and [[Jamie Lynn Spears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in the [[Bible Belt]], where socially conservative [[evangelical Protestantism]] is a particularly strong religious influence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRxNSxjYnMAC&amp;pg=PA141|title=Raising Up a Testimony|first=Matt|last=Soper|date=October 1, 2010|publisher=Xulon Press|isbn=9781609578183|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was baptized as a [[Southern Baptist]] and sang in a church choir as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoFm5aFfr4UC&amp;pg=PA24|title=The Exile of Britney Spears: A Tale of 21st Century Consumption|first=Christopher R.|last=Smit|date=December 29, 2017|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=9781841504100|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, she has studied [[Kabbalist]] teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrQvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111|title=Consuming Religion|first=Kathryn|last=Lofton|date=September 12, 2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226482125|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age three, Spears began attending dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Aged five she made her local stage debut, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news |title=Britney Spears' Biography |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008 |access-date=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131124739/https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html |archive-date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said of her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt;

When Spears was eight, she and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, to audition for the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly afterward, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]]. After the show was canceled in 1994, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's [[Parklane Academy]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to [[homecoming]] and [[Winter Formal|Christmas formal]]. But I wanted more."&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rs2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mundy |first=Chris |title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It |journal=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 2000 |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]."&lt;ref name="hughes145" /&gt;

Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref name="hughes145" /&gt; Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that "it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt; Spears sang Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Chuck |title=Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 |journal=Billboard |volume=110 |issue=43 |date=October 24, 1998 |access-date=March 11, 2011 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assigned her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month; he reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney".&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005 147"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger; more adult contemporary". She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me."&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt; She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt;

===1998–2000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again''===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [[NSYNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 12, 1999.&lt;ref name="stone99"/&gt; It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10&amp;nbsp;million copies in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.&lt;ref name=foxnews /&gt;

[[File:Britney Spears 1999.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Spears performing in 1999]]
[[...Baby One More Time (song)|"...Baby One More Time"]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album.

Spears has cited [[Madonna]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Whitney Houston]] as major influences, her "three favorite artists" as a child, whom she would "sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room"; Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Horvitz, Louis J.

Guy Blackman of ''[[The Age]]'' wrote that "[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence.

Upon launching her music career with ''...Baby One More Time'', Spears was labeled a [[teen idol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-top-25-teen-idol-breakout-moments-158080/britney-spears-2000-161347/|date=May 11, 2012 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 11, 2019|author=Greene, Andy|title=25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described her as "the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] pluck and spokesmodel charm."&lt;ref name="stone99" /&gt; The April 1999 cover of ''Rolling Stone'' featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts, while clutching a [[Teletubbies|Teletubby]].&lt;ref name="stone99"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-254871/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726051137/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-254871/ |url-status=live |archive-date=July 26, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story |access-date=June 11, 2019|date=April 1999 |author=Daly, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-lists/first-time-on-the-cover-14868/britney-spears-1999-2-23442/ |date=November 1, 2011 |access-date=May 13, 2020 |title=First Time on the Cover |work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Family Association]] (AFA) referred to the shoot as "a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality" and called on "God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums." Spears responded to the outcry commenting, "What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to [[Debbie Gibson]] and all of this bubblegum pop all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain abstinent until marriage.&lt;ref name=foxnews /&gt;&lt;ref name=biographybillboard&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?pid=290150 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806113351/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?pid=290150 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 6, 2008|year=2007 |access-date=June 12, 2019 |magazine=Billboard |title=Billboard.com – Biography – Britney Spears |author=Steve Huey, AllMusic Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early criticism of Spears dismissed her as a "manufactured pop star, the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona", which ''Vox'' editor Constance Grady assesses as being perpetuated from the fact that Spears debuted in the late 1990s, when music was dominated by [[rockism]], that prizes "so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else". Spears's "slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her." Ron Levy for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that "I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!"&lt;ref name=voxfreebritney/&gt;

''Billboard'' opined that, by the time she released her sophomore album ''Oops!...

Spears's much-publicized personal struggles and her subsequent career comeback have inspired some artists.
