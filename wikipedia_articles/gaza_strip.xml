Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. &lt;br /&gt;Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight.

Dowty 2008). ln other words, while Israel maintained that its occupation of Gaza ended with its unilateral disengagement Palestinians – as well as many human right organizations and international bodies – argued that Gaza was by all intents and purposes still occupied.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations, international human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators consider the territory to be still occupied by Israel, supported by additional restrictions placed on Gaza by Egypt. Israel maintains direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza: it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, as well as six of Gaza's seven land crossings. It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory.

When Hamas won a majority in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election]], the opposing political party, [[Fatah]], refused to join the proposed coalition, until a short-lived [[Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007|unity government agreement]] was brokered by [[Saudi Arabia]]. When this collapsed under pressure from Israel and the United States, the Palestinian Authority [[Palestinian Government of June 2007|instituted a non-Hamas government]] in the West Bank while Hamas [[Hamas government of June 2007|formed a government on its own in Gaza]].&lt;ref name="Deeb"&gt;Dennis J.

[[Hamas' takeover of Gaza|A brief civil war between the two Palestinian groups had broken out in Gaza]] when, apparently under a US-backed plan, Fatah contested Hamas's administration.

But the secret plan backfired, resulting in a further setback for American foreign policy under Bush. Instead of driving its enemies out of power, the U.S.-backed Fatah fighters inadvertently provoked Hamas to seize total control of Gaza.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sara Roy]], ''Hamas and Civil Society in Gaza,''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=mX1dAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 p.45]. 
 'Dahlan, who was supported by U.S. officials, has been a bitter enemy of Hamas since his 1996 crackdown on the movement. He consistently refused to accept the Palestinian unity government brokered by the Saudi government in the Mecca Agreement "and made his opposition intolerable to Hamas when he refused to subject the security forces under his command, armed and trained by the U.S., to the legitimate Palestinian unity government as agreed between Hamas and Fatah."  Alistair Crooke, a former Middle East adviser to the EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, similarly observed, "Dahlan refused to deal with (the independent interior minister appointed to the unity government), and put his troops on the streets in defiance of the interior minister.  Hamas felt that they had little option but to take control of security away from forces which were in fact creating insecurity."  Hence, Hamas was not attempting a coup against the government or the Fatah organization as a whole but also against Dahlan's U.S.-funded militia (and individual Fatah loyalists it blamed for the murder of Hamas members).'&lt;/ref&gt; and has remained the sole governing power in Gaza since that date.&lt;ref name="Deeb" /&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of Gaza}}

Gaza was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], before it was occupied by the United Kingdom (1918–1948), Egypt (1948–1967), and then Israel, which in 1993 granted the [[Palestinian Authority]] in Gaza limited self-governance through the [[Oslo Accords]]. Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has been ''de facto'' governed by [[Hamas]], which claims to represent the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and the Palestinian people.

The territory is still considered to be occupied by Israel by the United Nations, International human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators, despite the 2005 [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]].&lt;ref name=occ/&gt; Israel maintains direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza: it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, and six of Gaza's seven land crossings. It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory. Gaza is dependent on Israel for its water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities.&lt;ref name=occ/&gt;

The Gaza Strip acquired its current northern and eastern boundaries at the cessation of fighting in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 war]], confirmed by the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Israel–Egypt Armistice Agreement]] on 24 February 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/9EC4A332E2F9A128525643D007702E6 Egypt Israel Armistice Agreement] UN Doc S/1264/Corr.1 23 February 1949 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article V of the Agreement declared that the demarcation line was not to be an international border. At first the Gaza Strip was officially administered by the [[All-Palestine Government]], established by the [[Arab League]] in September 1948. All-Palestine in the Gaza Strip was managed under the military authority of Egypt, functioning as a [[puppet state]], until it officially merged into the [[United Arab Republic]] and dissolved in 1959. From the time of the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government until 1967, the Gaza Strip was directly administered by an Egyptian military governor.

Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Pursuant to the [[Oslo Accords]] signed in 1993, the [[Palestinian Authority]] became the administrative body that governed Palestinian population centers while Israel maintained control of the [[airspace]], [[territorial waters]] and border crossings with the exception of the [[Gaza–Egypt border|land border with Egypt]] which is controlled by Egypt. In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip under [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|their unilateral disengagement plan]].

In July 2007, after winning the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election]], Hamas became the elected government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/04/usa.israelandthepalestinians|title=US plotted to overthrow Hamas after election victory|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|date=2008-03-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y693DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|title=Between State and Non-State: Politics and Society in Kurdistan-Iraq and Palestine|last1=Gürbey|first1=Gülistan|last2=Hofmann|first2=Sabine|last3=Seyder|first3=Ferhad Ibrahim|date=2017-03-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-60181-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Hamas [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|expelled]] the rival party Fatah from Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/issues-derail-fatah-hamas-deal-171017185321599.html|title=Three issues that could derail the Fatah-Hamas deal|last=Amer|first=Adnan Abu|website=aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the [[Palestinian March 2007 National Unity Government|Unity Government]] between Gaza Strip and the West Bank, creating two separate governments for the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The Unity Government dissolved on 17 June 2015 after President Abbas said it was unable to operate in the Gaza Strip.

Following the takeover of Gaza by Hamas, the territory has been subjected to a blockade, maintained by Israel and Egypt.{{sfn|Seib|2012|p=148}} Israel maintains that this is necessary: to impede Hamas from rearming and to restrict [[Palestinian rocket attacks]]; Egypt maintains that it prevents Gaza residents from entering Egypt. The blockades by Israel and Egypt extended to drastic reductions in the availability of necessary construction materials, medical supplies, and foodstuffs following intensive airstrikes on Gaza City in December 2008. A leaked UN report in 2009 warned that the blockade was "devastating livelihoods" and causing gradual "de-development". It pointed out that glass was prohibited by the blockade.&lt;ref name="middleeastmonitor2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel tightens its blockade of Gaza for 'security reasons'|author=Samira Shackle|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/blogs/lifestyle/7813-israel-tightens-its-blockade-of-gaza-for-security-reasons|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014153810/http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/blogs/lifestyle/7813-israel-tightens-its-blockade-of-gaza-for-security-reasons|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 October 2013|work=[[Middle East Monitor]]|date=14 October 2013}}:'Yet critics point out that it is not just military supplies that cannot enter Gaza, but basic construction materials, medical supplies, and food stuffs.

===Prior to 1923===
[[File:Azza1917.jpg|thumb|British artillery battery in front of Gaza, 1917]]
The earliest major settlement in the area was at [[Tell El Sakan]] and [[Tall al-Ajjul]], two [[Bronze Age]] settlements that served as administrative outposts for [[Ancient Egypt]]ian governance.  The [[Philistines]], mentioned frequently in [[The Bible]], were located in the region, and the early city of Gaza was captured by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE during his Egyptian campaign.  Following the death of Alexander, Gaza, along with Egypt, fell under the administration of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], before passing to the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]] after about 200 BCE.  The city of Gaza was destroyed by the [[Hasmonean]] king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] in 96 BCE, and re-established under Roman administration during the 1st century CE.  The Gaza region was moved between different Roman provinces over time, from [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] to [[Syria Palaestina]] to [[Palaestina Prima]].  During the 7th century the territory was passed back and forth between the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) Empire and the Persian ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]) Empires before the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] was established during the great Islamic expansions of the 7th century.{{cn|date=May 2021}}

During the [[Crusades]], the city of Gaza was reported to be mostly abandoned and in ruins; the region was placed under the direct administration of the [[Knights Templar]] during the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; it was traded back and forth several times between Christian and Muslim rule during the 12th century, before the Crusader-founded kingdom lost control permanently and the land became part of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]]'s lands for a century until the [[Mongol]] ruler [[Hulagu Khan]] destroyed the city.  In the wake of the Mongols, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] established control over Egypt and the eastern Levant, and would control Gaza until the 16th century, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] absorbed the Mamluk territories.  Ottoman rule continued until the years following [[World War I]], when the [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire collapsed]] and Gaza formed part of the [[League of Nations]] British [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]].{{cn|date=May 2021}}

===1923–1948 British Mandate===
[[File:Gaza War Cemetery 3.jpg|thumb|[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Gaza War Cemetery]]]]
The [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] was based on the principles contained in Article 22 of the draft [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] and the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Resolution]] of 25 April 1920 by the principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied and associated powers]] after the First World War.&lt;ref name=cmd5479&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/88A6BF6F1BD82405852574CD006C457F Palestine Royal Commission Report Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty, July 1937, Cmd. 5479] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127035141/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/88A6BF6F1BD82405852574CD006C457F |date=27 January 2012 }}. His Majesty’s Stationery Office., London, 1937. 404 pages + maps.&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate formalized [[British Empire|British]] rule in the southern part of [[Ottoman Syria]] from 1923–1948.

===1948 All-Palestine government===

On 22 September 1948, towards the end of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[All-Palestine Government]] was proclaimed in the Egyptian-occupied Gaza City by the [[Arab League]]. It was conceived partly as an Arab League attempt to limit the influence of [[Jordan|Transjordan]] in Palestine. The All-Palestine Government was quickly recognized by six of the then seven members of the Arab League: [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Yemen]], but not by Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/all-palestine-government |title=All-Palestine Government, by Shlaim, Avi |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not recognized by any country outside the Arab League.

After the cessation of hostilities, the [[Israel–Egypt Armistice Agreement]] of 24 February 1949 established the separation line between Egyptian and Israeli forces, and set what became the present boundary between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Both sides declared that the boundary was not an international border. The southern border with Egypt continued to be the international border drawn in 1906 between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Land of the Negev (English title)|publisher=[[Israeli Defense Minitsry|Ministry of Defense]] Publishing|editor1=Gardus, Yehuda |editor2=Shmueli, Avshalom |year=1978–79|language=he}} pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip or Egypt were issued All-Palestine passports. Egypt did not offer them citizenship. From the end of 1949, they received aid directly from [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]]. During the [[Suez Crisis]] (1956), the Gaza Strip and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] were occupied by Israeli troops, who withdrew under international pressure. The government was accused of being little more than a façade for Egyptian control, with negligible independent funding or influence. It subsequently moved to [[Cairo]] and dissolved in 1959 by decree of Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].

===1959–1967 Egyptian occupation===
{{main|Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt}}
[[File:Che Guevara in Gaza.jpg|thumb|[[Che Guevara]] visiting Gaza in 1959]]After the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967.

===1967 Israeli occupation===
In June 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]], Israel Defense Forces captured the Gaza Strip.

According to [[Tom Segev]], moving the Palestinians out of the country had been a persistent element of Zionist thinking from early times.&lt;ref name="TSegev" &gt;[[Tom Segev]]    [https://books.google.com/books?id=ggLatcD7gW4C&amp;pg=PA532 1967: ''Israel, the War, and the Year that Transformed the Middle East,'']   Henry Holt and Company, 2007 p.532&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1967, during a meeting at which the [[Security Cabinet of Israel|Security Cabinet]] [[brainstorming|brainstormed]] about what to do with the Arab population of the newly occupied territories, one of the suggestions Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] proffered regarding Gaza was that the people might leave if Israel restricted their access to water supplies, stating: "Perhaps if we don't give them enough water they won't have a choice, because the orchards will yellow and wither."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Ofir, [http://mondoweiss.net/2017/11/liberal-contemplating-genocide/ Liberal Israeli leaders were contemplating genocide in Gaza already in 1967] [[Mondoweiss]] on 17 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ofer | last=Aderet | url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-pm-in-67-we-ll-deprive-gaza-of-water-and-the-arabs-will-leave-1.5465942 | title=Israeli Prime Minister After Six-Day War: 'We'll Deprive Gaza of Water, and the Arabs Will Leave | newspaper=[[Haaretz]] | date=17 November 2017 | access-date=19 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{undue weight inline|reason=Sensationalist presentation of one of several ideas raised (A wide spectrum of ideas – which also included a unilateral Israeli withdrawal), i.e. [[WP:FART]], in a single post-war Israeli cabinet meeting that wasn't followed up by Israeli authorities let alone implemented|date=November 2017}} A number of measures, including financial incentives, were taken shortly afterwards to begin to encourage Gazans to emigrate elsewhere.&lt;ref name="TSegev" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nur Masalha]], ''The politics of denial: Israel and the Palestinian refugee problem.''   Pluto Press, 2003 p.104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to this military victory, Israel created the first settlement bloc in the Strip, [[Gush Katif]], in the southwest corner near [[Rafah]] and the Egyptian border on a spot where a [[Kfar Darom|small kibbutz]] had previously existed for 18 months between 1946–48.{{refn|The kibbutz community had been established as part of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency's]] "[[11 points in the Negev]]" plan, in which 11 Jewish villages were built across the Negev in a single night as a response to the [[Morrison-Grady Plan]], which threatened to exclude the Negev from a future Jewish State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kfar Darom |website=Katif center |url=http://www.mkatif.org/Web/en/Katif/History/Kfardarom/Default.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132136/http://www.mkatif.org/Web/en/Katif/History/Kfardarom/Default.aspx |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In total, between 1967 and 2005, Israel established 21 settlements in Gaza, comprising 20% of the total territory.

The [[Gross national product|economic growth rate]] from 1967 to 1982 averaged roughly 9.7 percent per annum, due in good part to expanded income from work opportunities inside Israel, which had a major utility for the latter by supplying the country with a large unskilled and semi-skilled workforce. Gaza's agricultural sector was adversely affected as one-third of the Strip was appropriated by Israel, competition for scarce water resources stiffened, and the lucrative cultivation of citrus declined with the advent of Israeli policies, such as prohibitions on planting new trees and taxation that gave breaks to Israeli producers, factors which militated against growth. Gaza's direct exports of these products to Western markets, as opposed to Arab markets, was prohibited except through Israeli marketing vehicles, in order to assist Israeli citrus exports to the same markets. The overall result was that large numbers of farmers were forced out of the agricultural sector. Israel placed quotas on all goods exported from Gaza, while abolishing restrictions on the flow of Israeli goods into the Strip. [[Sara Roy]] characterised the pattern as one of structural de-development&lt;ref&gt;[[Sara Roy]],  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536651 'The Gaza Strip: A Case of Economic De-Development,'] [[Journal of Palestine Studies]], Vol. 17, No. 1 (Autumn, 1987), pp. 56–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty====
On 26 March 1979, Israel and Egypt signed the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Israel's Fateful Hour|url=https://archive.org/details/israelsfatefulho00hark|url-access=registration|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|location=New York|author=Harkabi, Yehoshafat|year=1988}} p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the treaty provided for the withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the Six-Day War. The Egyptians agreed to keep the Sinai Peninsula demilitarized. The final status of the Gaza Strip, and other relations between Israel and Palestinians, was not dealt with in the treaty. Egypt renounced all territorial claims to territory north of the international border. The Gaza Strip remained under Israeli military administration until 1994. During that time, the military was responsible for the maintenance of civil facilities and services.

After the [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty]] 1979, a 100-meter-wide buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt known as the [[Philadelphi Route]] was established. The international [[border]] along the [[Philadelphi corridor]] between Egypt and the Gaza Strip is {{convert|7|mi|km|sp=us}} long.

===1994: Gaza under Palestinian Authority===
In September 1992, Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] told a delegation from the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] "I would like Gaza to sink into the sea, but that won't happen, and a solution must be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1032701.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Analysis: Hopeless in Gaza |work=BBC News |date=2000-11-20 |access-date=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1994, following the Palestinian-Israeli agreements known as the [[Oslo Accords]], a phased transfer of governmental authority to the Palestinians took place. Much of the Strip (except for the settlement blocs and military areas) came under Palestinian control. The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas, leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas. The Palestinian Authority, led by [[Yasser Arafat]], chose Gaza City as its first provincial headquarters. In September 1995, Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] signed [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|a second peace agreement]], extending the Palestinian Authority to most [[West Bank]] towns.

Between 1994 and 1996, Israel built the [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier]] to improve security in Israel. The barrier was largely torn down by Palestinians at the beginning of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in September 2000.&lt;ref name="Doron Almog"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Lessons of the Gaza Security Fence for the West Bank |author=Almog, Major General Doron |publisher=Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs |date=23 December 2004 |volume=4 |edition=12 |url=http://www.jcpa.org/brief/brief004-12.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:War in Gaza 023 - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|View of Gaza during the 2000s.]]

====2000 Second Intifada====

The [[Second Intifada]] broke out in September 2000 with waves of protest, civil unrest and bombings against Israeli military and civilians, many of them perpetrated by suicide bombers. The Second Intifada also marked the beginning of rocket attacks and bombings of Israeli border localities by Palestinian guerrillas from the Gaza Strip, especially by the [[Hamas]] and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] movements.

Between December 2000 and June 2001, the barrier between Gaza and Israel was reconstructed. A barrier on the Gaza Strip-Egypt border was constructed starting in 2004.&lt;ref name="Anne Barnard"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Life in Gaza Steadily Worsens |first=Anne |last=Barnard |work=The Boston Globe |date=22 October 2006 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/10/22/life_in_gaza_steadily_worsens/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main crossing points are the northern [[Erez Crossing]] into Israel and the southern [[Rafah Border Crossing|Rafah Crossing]] into Egypt.

====2005 Israel's unilateral disengagement====
{{main|Israeli disengagement from Gaza}}
In February 2005, the [[Knesset]] approved a [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] and began removing Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005. All Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and the joint Israeli-Palestinian Erez Industrial Zone were dismantled, and 9,000 Israelis, most living in [[Gush Katif]], were forcibly evicted.[[File:Gaza Strip Barrier near the Karni Crossing.jpg|thumb|Barrier fence]]

On 12 September 2005, the Israeli cabinet formally declared an end to Israeli [[military occupation]] of the Gaza Strip.

"The [[Oslo Agreement]]s gave Israel full control over Gaza's airspace, but established that the Palestinians could build an airport in the area..." and the disengagement plan states that: "Israel will hold sole control of Gaza [[airspace]] and will continue to carry out military activity in the waters of the Gaza Strip." "Therefore, Israel continues to maintain exclusive control of Gaza's airspace and the [[territorial waters]], just as it has since it occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/control_on_air_space_and_territorial_waters|title=Israel's control of the airspace and the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip|work=btselem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] has advised the [[UN Human Rights Council]] that it (and others) consider Israel to be the [[occupying power]] of the Gaza Strip because Israel controls Gaza Strip's [[airspace]], [[territorial waters]] and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.&lt;ref name="isrlpa13698"&gt;[https://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm "Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015172833/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm |date=15 October 2008 }} 6 July 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn2009-01-06"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/06/israel.gaza.occupation.question/index.html|title=Is Gaza 'occupied' territory?|last=Levs|first=Josh|date=6 January 2009|publisher=CNN|access-date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AI_briefing"/&gt; The [[EU]] considers Gaza to be occupied.&lt;ref name="eccpalestine.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eccpalestine.org/eu-heads-of-missions-report-on-gaza/ |title=EU Heads of Missions' report on Gaza 2013 |publisher=Eccpalestine.org |access-date=2014-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714172357/http://www.eccpalestine.org/eu-heads-of-missions-report-on-gaza/ |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel also withdrew from the [[Philadelphi Route]], a narrow strip of land adjacent to the border with Egypt, after Egypt agreed to secure its side of the border. Under the [[Oslo Accords]], the Philadelphi Route was to remain under Israeli control to prevent the smuggling of weapons and people across the Egyptian border, but Egypt (under [[EU]] supervision) committed itself to patrolling the area and preventing such incidents. With the [[Agreement on Movement and Access]], known as the [[Rafah Agreement]] in the same year Israel ended its presence in the Philadelphi Route and transferred responsibility for security arrangements to Egypt and the PA under the supervision of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reut-institute.org/en/Publication.aspx?PublicationId=1180 |title=Philadelphi Route |publisher=Reut Institute |access-date=2014-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israel Defense Forces]] left the Gaza Strip on 1 September 2005 as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]] and all Israeli citizens were evicted from the area. In November 2005, an "Agreement on Movement and Access" between Israel and the [[Palestinian Authority]] was brokered by then US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] to improve Palestinian freedom of movement and economic activity in the Gaza Strip. Under its terms, the [[Rafah]] crossing with [[Egypt]] was to be reopened, with transits monitored by the Palestinian National Authority and the [[European Union]]. Only people with Palestinian ID, or foreign nationals, by exception, in certain categories, subject to Israeli oversight, were permitted to cross in and out. All goods, vehicles and trucks to and from Egypt passed through the [[Kerem Shalom Crossing]], under full Israeli supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tanya Reinhart]], ''The Road to Nowhere'', Verso, London 2006 pp.134–5&lt;/ref&gt; Goods were also permitted transit at the [[Karni crossing]] in the north.

After the Israeli withdrawal in 2005 the [[Oslo Accords]] give the Palestinian Authority administrative authority in the Gaza Strip. The [[Rafah Border Crossing]] has been supervised by [[European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah|EU Border Assistance Mission Rafah]] under an agreement finalized in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eubam-rafah.eu/files/20140710%20EUBAM%20Rafah_en%202.pdf|title=EU Border Assistance Mission for Rafah Crossing Point (EU BAM Rafah)|publisher=EUBAM Rafah|date=July 2014|orig-year=2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212072145/http://eubam-rafah.eu/files/20140710%20EUBAM%20Rafah_en%202.pdf|archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oslo Accord]] permits Israel to control the [[airspace]] and sea space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel's Dreaded Tipping Point Has Finally Arrived|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/israels-dreaded-tipping-point-has-finally-arrived/273830/|work=The Atlantic|access-date=10 March 2013|author=S.

In January 2007, fighting erupted between Hamas and [[Fatah]]. The deadliest clashes occurred in the northern Gaza Strip, where General Muhammed Gharib, a senior commander of the Fatah-dominated [[Preventive Security Force]], died when a rocket hit his home.

On 30 January 2007, a truce was negotiated between Fatah and Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/31/AR2007013100198_pf.html ''Palestinian Cease-Fire Holds on 1st Day'']. Ibrahim Barzak, Associated Press, 31 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a few days, new fighting broke out. On 1 February, Hamas killed 6 people in an ambush on a Gaza convoy which delivered equipment for Abbas' [[Palestinian Presidential Guard]], according to diplomats, meant to counter smuggling of more powerful weapons into Gaza by Hamas for its fast-growing "Executive Force". According to Hamas, the deliveries to the Presidential Guard were intended to instigate sedition (against Hamas), while withholding money and assistance from the Palestinian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070201/wl_nm/palestinians_dc |title=Six killed in Hamas ambush on Gaza convoy |access-date=6 February 2007 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206223752/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070201/wl_nm/palestinians_dc |archive-date=6 February 2007 }}.

Fighting spread in the Gaza Strip, with both factions attacking vehicles and facilities of the other side. Following a breakdown in an Egyptian-brokered truce, Israel launched an air strike which destroyed a building used by Hamas. Ongoing violence prompted fear that it could bring the end of the [[Palestinian government of March 2007|Fatah-Hamas coalition government]], and possibly the end of the Palestinian authority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070516/ts_nm/palestinians_dc Israel attacks in Gaza amid factional violence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609072031/https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070516/ts_nm/palestinians_dc |date=9 June 2007 }}, by Nidal al-Mughrabi, Associated Press, 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 Hamas takeover===
{{main|Fatah–Hamas battle in Gaza}}
[[File:Al Deira Hotel Gaza April 2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Al Deira Hotel]] on the Gaza coast, 2009]]

Following the victory of Hamas in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election]], Hamas and [[Fatah]] formed the [[Palestinian authority national unity government]] headed by [[Ismail Haniya]]. Shortly after, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]],&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamas takes control of Gaza |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/15/israel4 |access-date=3 June 2010 |newspaper=Guardian |date=15 June 2007 |location=London |first1=Ian |last1=Black |first2=Mark |last2=Tran}}&lt;/ref&gt; seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own.&lt;ref name="intern_fight_p14-15"&gt;{{cite book |title=Internal fight: Palestinian abuses in Gaza and the West Bank |pages=14–15 |author2=Human Rights Watch |first1=Fred |last1=Abrahams |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |year=2008|author2-link=Human Rights Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 14 June, Hamas fully controlled the Gaza Strip. [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian President]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]] responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]], dissolving the unity government and forming a new government without Hamas participation. [[Preventive Security Service|PNA security forces]] in the [[West Bank]] arrested a number of Hamas members.

In late June 2008, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan declared the West Bank-based cabinet formed by Abbas as "the sole legitimate Palestinian government". Egypt moved its embassy from Gaza to the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/874106.html |title=Mubarak calls Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip a 'coup' |work=Haaretz |access-date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saudi Arabia]] and Egypt supported reconciliation and a new unity government and pressed Abbas to start talks with Hamas. Abbas had always conditioned this on Hamas returning control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority. Hamas visited a number of countries, including Russia, and the [[European Union|EU]] member states. Opposition parties and politicians called for a dialogue with Hamas as well as an end to the economic sanctions.

After the takeover, Israel and Egypt [[blockade of the Gaza Strip|closed their border crossings with Gaza]]. Palestinian sources reported that European Union monitors fled the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], on the Gaza–Egypt border for fear of being kidnapped or harmed.&lt;ref name=EU_flee_Rafah_crossing&gt;{{cite web|last=Dudkevitch |first=Margot |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1139395602714 |title=EU monitors flee Rafah border crossing |work=Jerusalem Post |date=14 March 2006 |access-date=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511121459/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1139395602714 |archive-date=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab foreign ministers and Palestinian officials presented a united front against control of the border by Hamas.&lt;ref name="Abbas wins Egypt backing on border"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/01/2008525125823983496.html |title=Middle East&amp;nbsp;— Abbas wins Egypt backing on border |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=28 January 2008 |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Israeli and Egyptian security reports said that Hamas continued smuggling in large quantities of explosives and arms from Egypt through tunnels. Egyptian security forces uncovered 60 tunnels in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1192380807070&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Egypt finds 60 Gaza tunnels in 10 months |work=Jerusalem Post |date=13 November 2007 |access-date=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511121629/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1192380807070&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archive-date=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Israel increased its state of alert along the length of the Israel-Egypt Sinai border, and warned its citizens to leave Sinai "without delay."

The EU Border Monitors initially monitored the border because Hamas guaranteed their safety, but they later fled. The Palestinian Authority demanded that Egypt deal only with the Authority in negotiations relating to borders.

In February 2008, [[2008 Israel-Gaza conflict]] intensified, with rockets launched at Israeli cities. Aggression by Hamas led to Israeli military action on 1 March 2008, resulting in over 110 Palestinians being killed according to BBC News, as well as 2 Israeli soldiers.

Since its takeover of Gaza, Hamas has exercised executive authority over the Gaza Strip, and it governs the territory through its own ''[[ad hoc]]'' executive, legislative, and judicial bodies.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/gaza-strip|title=Gaza Strip *|date=4 January 2018|website=freedomhouse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamas government of 2012 was the second Palestinian [[Hamas]]-dominated government, ruling over the [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Gaza Strip]], since the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|split]] of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007. It was announced in early September 2012.&lt;ref name=hurriyet0209&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/hamas-announces-cabinet-reshuffle-in-gaza.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=29198&amp;NewsCatID=352 |title=Hamas announces cabinet reshuffle in Gaza |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |access-date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reshuffle of the previous government was approved by Gaza-based Hamas MPs from the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) or parliament.&lt;ref name=hurriyet0209/&gt;

The legal code Hamas applies in Gaza is based on [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] laws, the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]]'s 1936 legal code, [[Palestinian law|Palestinian Authority law]], [[Sharia law]], and Israeli military orders. Hamas maintains a judicial system with civilian and military courts and a public prosecution service.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2984906|title=Ideology and Practice: The Legal System in Gaza under Hamas|first=Nicolas|last=Pelham|via=www.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
The Gaza Strip's security is mainly handled by Hamas through its military wing, the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], internal security service, and civil police force. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades have an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 operatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-gains-credibility-fighting-force-analysts-say-371780262|title=Hamas growing in military stature, say analysts|website=Middle East Eye}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other Palestinian militant factions operate in the Gaza Strip alongside, and sometimes opposed to Hamas. The [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]], also known as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second largest militant faction operating in the Gaza Strip.

===Legality of Hamas rule===
After Hamas' June 2007 takeover, it ousted Fatah-linked officials from positions of power and authority (such as government positions, security services, universities, newspapers, etc.) and strove to enforce law by progressively removing guns from the hands of peripheral militias, clans, and criminal groups, and gaining control of supply tunnels. According to [[Amnesty International]], under Hamas rule, newspapers were closed down and journalists were harassed.&lt;ref name=AI_torn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde21/020/2007/en/|title=Torn apart by factional strife|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=24 October 2007|access-date=23 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatah demonstrations were forbidden or suppressed, as in the case of a large demonstration on the anniversary of [[Yasser Arafat]]'s death, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, after protesters hurled stones at Hamas security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/hamas_kills_seven_at_arafat_rally_in_gaza_135015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070813050106/http://news.sbs.com.au/worldnewsaustralia/hamas_kills_seven_at_arafat_rally_in_gaza_135015 |archive-date=13 August 2007 |title=Hamas kills seven at Arafat rally in Gaza |url-status=dead |access-date=1 June 2016}}, AFP, (via SBS World News Australia), 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas and other militant groups continued to fire Qassam rockets across the border into Israel. According to Israel, between the Hamas takeover and the end of January 2008, 697 rockets and 822 mortar bombs were fired at Israeli towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Missile+fire+from+Gaza+on+Israeli+civilian+targets+Aug+2007.htm#statistics |title=Israeli MFA |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |access-date=1 June 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011023634/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-%2BObstacle%2Bto%2BPeace/Palestinian%2Bterror%2Bsince%2B2000/Missile%2Bfire%2Bfrom%2BGaza%2Bon%2BIsraeli%2Bcivilian%2Btargets%2BAug%2B2007.htm#statistics |archive-date = 11 October 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Israel targeted Qassam launchers and military targets and declared the Gaza Strip a hostile entity. In January 2008, Israel curtailed travel from Gaza, the entry of goods, and cut fuel supplies, resulting in power shortages. This brought charges that Israel was inflicting [[collective punishment]] on the Gaza population, leading to international condemnation. Despite multiple reports from within the Strip that food and other essentials were in short supply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5122404.stm |title=Profile: Gaza Strip |work=BBC News |date=6 January 2009 |access-date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel said that Gaza had enough food and energy supplies for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3496654,00.html |title=IDF official rejects claims of humanitarian crisis in Gaza |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |access-date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli government uses economic means to pressure Hamas. Among other things, it caused Israeli commercial enterprises like banks and fuel companies to stop doing business with the Gaza Strip.

===Occupation===

The international community regards all of the [[Palestinian territories]] including Gaza as occupied.&lt;ref name=aj_reality_check&gt;See the short video [http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2015/10/reality-check-gaza-occupied-151023153703888.html ''Reality Check: Gaza is still occupied''] on Al Jazeera, showing the arguments&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] has declared at the [[UN Human Rights Council]] that it views Israel as a ''de facto'' occupying power in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel has no military or other presence, because the [[Oslo Accords]] authorize Israel to control the [[airspace]] and the [[territorial sea]].&lt;ref name="isrlpa13698" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn2009-01-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AI_briefing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/007/2009/en/ |title=Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability |date=19 January 2009 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |access-date=5 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaliser, [[Birzeit University|Mustafa Mari]], and [[Iain Scobbie]]) maintain that Israel's extensive direct external control over Gaza, and indirect control over the lives of its internal population mean that Gaza remained occupied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imeu.org/article/reference-sheet-israel-gaza-international-law1 'Israel, Gaza &amp; International Law,'] 19 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Sanger, 'The Contemporary Law of Blockade and the Gaza Freedom Flotilla,' in M.N.

Israel re-deployed its military occupation forces and evacuated its illegal settlers outside the population centers in Gaza. BUT Israel effectively controls the sea, land and air spaces and border crossings that link the Gaza Strip to the outside world. According to the UN and human rights organizations, Israel still maintains its occupation of the Gaza Strip and subjects the 1.8 million Palestinians in this tiny strip to a horrendous siege and blockade that constitute a war crime under international law." Here, Hamas cites the view of the international community.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel states that it does not exercise effective control or authority over any land or institutions in the Gaza Strip and thus the Gaza Strip is no longer subject to the former [[military occupation]].&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;Dore Gold, [http://www.jcpa.org/brief/brief005-3.htm JCPA Legal Acrobatics: The Palestinian Claim that Gaza is Still "Occupied" Even After Israel Withdraws], [[Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs]], Vol. 5, No. 3, 26 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=443&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2021&amp;TTL=International_Law_and_Gaza:_The_Assault_on_Israel’s_Right_to_Self-Defense International Law and Gaza: The Assault on Israel's Right to Self-Defense] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306092456/http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=443&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2021&amp;TTL=International_Law_and_Gaza%3A_The_Assault_on_Israel%E2%80%99s_Right_to_Self-Defense |date=6 March 2012 }}, [[Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs]], Vol. 7, No. 29 28 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel]] [[Tzipi Livni]] stated in January 2008: "Israel got out of Gaza.

The Supreme Court ruled that Israel has not exercised effective control over the Gaza Strip since 2005, and accordingly, it was no longer occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind the Headlines: Israeli Supreme Court Decision HCJ 9132/07 |date=3 Feb 2008 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/issues/pages/court%20upholds%20israeli%20limitations%20of%20the%20supply%20of%20fuel%20and%20electricity%20to%20gaza%203-feb-2008.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a legal analysis Hanne Cuyckens agrees with the Israeli position that Gaza is no longer occupied - "Gaza is not technically occupied, given that there is no longer any effective control in the sense of Article 42 of the Hague Regulations. ... Even though the majority argues that the Gaza Strip is still occupied, the effective control test at the core of the law of occupation is no longer met and hence Gaza is no longer occupied." She disagrees that Israel cannot therefore be held responsible for the situation in Gaza because: "Nonetheless Israel continues to exercise an important level of control over the Gaza Strip and its population, making it difficult to accept that it would no longer have any obligations with regard to the Strip. ... the absence of occupation does not mean the absence of accountability. This responsibility is however not founded on the law of occupation but on general international humanitarian law, potentially complemented by international human rights law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cuyckens |first=Hanne|year=2016|title=Is Israel Still an Occupying Power in Gaza? |journal=Netherlands International Law Review |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=275–295 |doi=10.1007/s40802-016-0070-1|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avi Bell]] argues that Israel does not control the Gaza Strip for the purposes of the law of belligerent occupation or human rights duties: "The Naletilic decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia recited several factors indicating an occupier’s effective control, including that the local authorities must be incapable of functioning publicly, the occupier must have force present on the ground (or at least capable of being projected in a reasonable time to make authority felt) and the occupier must enforce directions to the civilian population. Similarly, as the Nuremberg Tribunal ruled in the case of Wilhelm List and others (the Hostages Case), "an occupation indicates the exercise of governmental authority to the exclusion of the established government", meaning that the local "civil government [should be] eliminated". These factors demonstrate that Israel does not have control over Gaza. There is a local independent administration in the Gaza Strip that does not answer to Israel (and in fact, openly and repeatedly carries out belligerent attacks against Israel). Israel does not have troops regularly deployed in Gaza, and it can only deploy such troops through heavy and difficult fighting. The local civilian population does not answer to Israel. Israel has no local administration... It is simply not plausible to argue that Israel exercises effective control over the Gaza Strip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Bell |first=Avi |date=July 2014 |title=Israel May Stop Supplying Water and Electricity to Gaza |publisher=Kohelet Policy Forum |url=https://euiha41fnsb2lyeld3vkc37i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/israel-may-stop-supplying-water-and-electricity-to-Gaza-updated.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Alex Stein]] argued in 2014 that Gaza was not occupied by Israel, and thus Israel's only obligation under international law towards Gaza was to minimize harm to civilians during military operations. In particular, he wrote that Israel was under no legal obligation to provide it with electricity, though it may choose to do so for humanitarian reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/newly-appointed-israeli-supreme-court-justice-rapped-high-court-1.5863689|title=Israel's New Supreme Court Justice's Deleted Facebook Post: Israel Isn't Obligated to Provide Gaza With Electricity|date=28 February 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuval Shany]] also argues that Israel is probably not an occupying power in Gaza under international law, writing that "it is difficult to continue and regard Israel as the occupying power in Gaza under the traditional law of occupation," but that some legal theories might downplay the significance of the lack of an Israeli presence on the ground, and that Israel still continues to exercise some control over Gaza in parallel with the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]. Shany wrote that "in order to identify the ultimate power of government in Gaza one should engage in a comparative analysis of the degree of effective control exercised by the two competing sources of authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=Faraway, so Close: The Legal Status of Gaza after Israel's Disengagement|first=Yuval|last=Shany|date=9 August 2006|ssrn = 923151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statehood===
Some Israeli analysts have argued that the Gaza Strip can be considered a ''[[de facto]]'' independent state, even if not internationally recognized as such. Israeli Major General [[Giora Eiland]], who headed Israel's [[National Security Council (Israel)|National Security Council]], has argued that after the disengagement and Hamas takeover, the Gaza Strip became a de facto state for all intents and purposes, writing that "It has clear borders, an effective government, an independent foreign policy and an army. These are the exact characteristics of a state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5275535,00.html|title=Needed: A different Gaza strategy|date=6 February 2018|website=Ynetnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Yagil Levy, a Professor of Political Sociology and Public Policy at the [[Open University of Israel]], wrote in a ''[[Haaretz]]'' column that "Gaza is a state in every respect, at least as social scientists understand the term. It has a central government with an army that’s subordinate to it and that protects a population living in a defined territory. Nevertheless, Gaza is a castrated state. Israel and Egypt control its borders. The Palestinian Authority pays for the salaries of some of its civil servants. And the army doesn’t have a monopoly on armed force, because there are independent militias operating alongside it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-strengthen-the-state-of-gaza-1.6358839|title=Opinion {{!}} Strengthen the State of Gaza|first=Yagil|last=Levy|date=7 August 2018|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe Arens]], a former Israeli diplomat who served as Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, likewise wrote that Gaza is a state as "it has a government, an army, a police force and courts that dispense justice of sorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-gaza-a-failed-palestinian-state-1.5488422|title=Opinion {{!}} Gaza, a Failed Palestinian State|first=Moshe|last=Arens|date=26 June 2017 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, Israeli Justice Minister [[Ayelet Shaked]] asserted that Gaza is an independent state, stating that Palestinians "already have a state" in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/shaked-touts-confederation-of-jordan-gaza-and-parts-of-west-bank/|title=Shaked touts 'confederation' of Jordan, Gaza, and parts of West Bank|first=Raphael|last=Ahren|work=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Aronson]] has likewise argued that the Gaza Strip can be considered a [[proto-state]] with some aspects of sovereignty, writing that "a proto-state already exists in the Gaza Strip, with objective attributes of sovereignty the Ramallah-based Mahmoud Abbas can only dream about. Gaza is a single, contiguous territory with de facto borders, recognised, if not always respected, by friend and foe alike. There are no permanently stationed foreign occupiers and, most importantly, no civilian Israeli settlements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/05/era-sovereignty-gaza-150504054233875.html |title=A new era of sovereignty in Gaza - Gaza: After the war |work=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in '' [[Newsweek]]'', journalist Marc Schulman referred to Gaza as "an impoverished proto-state that lives off aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/tel-aviv-diary-tragedy-palestinians-502021|title=Tel Aviv Diary: The tragedy of the Palestinians|first1=Marc |last1=Schulman |date=23 September 2016|work=[[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over airspace===
As agreed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the [[Oslo Accords]], Israel has exclusive control over the airspace. It can interfere with radio and TV transmissions, and the Palestinian Authority cannot engage in independent initiatives for operating a seaport or airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/control_on_air_space_and_territorial_waters 'Israel's control of the airspace and the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip,'  ] [[B'Tselem]] 1 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Accords also permitted Palestinians to construct an airport, which was duly built and opened in 1998. Israel destroyed Gaza's only airport in 2001 and 2002, during the [[Second Intifada]].&lt;ref name=msnbc_fly_again/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2005/&gt;

The Israeli army makes use of [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drones]], which can launch precise missiles. They are equipped with high-resolution cameras and other sensors. In addition, the missile fired from a drone has its own cameras that allow the operator to observe the target from the moment of firing. After a missile has been launched, the drone operator can remotely divert it elsewhere. Drone operators can view objects on the ground in detail during both day and night.&lt;ref name=precisely_wrong&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/06/30/precisely-wrong/gaza-civilians-killed-israeli-drone-launched-missiles ''Precisely Wrong—Gaza Civilians Killed by Israeli Drone-Launched Missiles'']. Human Rights Watch, 30 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli drones routinely patrol over Gaza.

===Buffer zone===
Part of the territory is depopulated because of the imposition of buffer zones on both the Israeli and Egyptian borders.&lt;ref name=bbc_hard_times&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11721118 ''Hard times drive Gazans into perilous ′buffer zone′'']. BBC, 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pchr_enforced_live_fire&gt;[http://www.imemc.org/article/71548 ''PCHR-Gaza: Israeli Buffer Zone Policies Typically Enforced with Live Fire''].

Initially, Israel imposed a 50-meter buffer zone in Gaza.&lt;ref name=imemc_2011-04-05&gt;[http://www.imemc.org/article/61003 ''Palestinian Killed in Gaza Buffer Zone'']. IMEMC, 5 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, it was expanded to 150 meters.&lt;ref name=pchr_enforced_live_fire/&gt; Following the 2005 [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]], an undefined buffer zone was maintained, including a no-fishing zone along the coast.

In 2009/2010, Israel expanded the buffer zone to 300 meters.&lt;ref name=ocha_factsheet_july_2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=imemc_2011-04-05/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=255137 Peaceful march reaches Gaza buffer zone]. Ma'an News Agency, 18 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the UN estimated that 30 percent of the arable land in Gaza had been lost to the buffer zone.&lt;ref name=bbc_hard_times/&gt;&lt;ref name=imemc_2011-04-05/&gt;

On 25 February 2013, pursuant to a November 2012 ceasefire, Israel declared a buffer zone of 100 meters on land and 6 nautical miles offshore. In the following month, the zone was changed to 300 meters and 3 nautical miles. The 1994 [[Gaza Jericho Agreement]] allows 20&amp;nbsp;nautical miles, and the 2002 Bertini Commitment allows 12&amp;nbsp;nautical miles.&lt;ref name=ocha_factsheet_july_2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=pchr_enforced_live_fire/&gt;

In August 2015, the IDF confirmed a buffer zone of 300 meters for residents and 100 meters for farmers, but without explaining how to distinguish between the two.&lt;ref name=gisha_idf_spokesman&gt;[http://gisha.org/legal/4577 IDF spokesman provides contradictory answers regarding the width of the "no-go zone" which residents of the Gaza Strip are prohibited from entering]. Gisha, August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, on a third of Gaza's agricultural land, residents risk Israeli attacks. According to [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights|PCHR]], Israeli attacks take place up to approximately {{convert|1.5|km|1|abbr=on}} from the border, making 17% of Gaza's total territory a risk zone.&lt;ref name=pchr_enforced_live_fire/&gt;

Israel says the buffer zone is needed to protect Israeli communities just over the border from sniper fire and rocket attacks. In the 18 months until November 2010, one Thai farm worker in Israel was killed by a rocket fired from Gaza, and in 2010, according to IDF figures, 180 rockets and mortars had been fired into Israel by militants. In 6 months, however, 11 Palestinians civilians, including four children, had been killed by Israeli fire and at least 70 Palestinian civilians were injured in the same period, including at least 49 who were working collecting rubble and scrap metal.&lt;ref name=bbc_hard_times/&gt;

===Gaza blockade===
Israel and Egypt maintain a [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]], although Israel allows in limited quantities of medical humanitarian aid. The Red Cross claimed that the blockade harms the economy and causes a shortage of basic medicines and equipment such as painkillers and x-ray film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1096443.html |title=Red Cross: Israel trapping 1.5m Gazans in despair |date=29 June 2009 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel claims the blockade is necessary to prevent the smuggling of weapons into Gaza. For example, in 2014, a Panamanian-flagged ship claiming to be carrying construction materials was boarded by the IDF and was found to contain Syrian produced rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Iranian-arms-vessel-captured-by-IDF-to-dock-in-Eilat-344702 |title=Iranian arms vessel captured by IDF docks in Eilat |publisher=Jpost.com |date=3 August 2014 |access-date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Israel maintains that the blockade is legal and necessary to limit [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|Palestinian rocket attacks]] from the Gaza Strip on its cities and to prevent Hamas from obtaining other weapons.&lt;ref name="Gaza's Tunnel Economy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="middleeastmonitor2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=288686 |title=Court extends remand of Israelis aboard Gaza ship |work=Jerusalem Post |access-date=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idf100908"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mag.idf.il/163-4314-en/patzar.aspx|title=Position paper on the naval blockade on Gaza|date=2010-09-08|publisher=idf.il|access-date=28 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116231842/http://www.mag.idf.il/163-4314-en/patzar.aspx|archive-date=2012-01-16}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131015054031/http://www.mag.idf.il/sip_storage//FILES/5/915.pdf Full version in Hebrew])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/12/gaza-donors-un-should-press-israel-blockade ''Gaza: Donors, UN Should Press Israel on Blockade''], Human Rights Watch, 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Director of the [[Shin Bet]] (Israel Security Agency) [[Yuval Diskin]] did not oppose easing trade restrictions, but said that [[smuggling tunnel]]s in Sinai and an open seaport in the Gaza Strip endangered Israel's security. According to Diskin, Hamas and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] had smuggled in over "5,000 rockets with ranges up to {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}." Some of the rockets could reach as far as the [[Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?ID=178503 |title=Diskin: No aid crisis in Gaza |publisher=Jpost.com |date=15 June 2010 |access-date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has alternately [[Goods allowed or banned for import into Gaza#Import through Israel|restricted or allowed goods]] and people to cross the terrestrial border and handles vicariously the movement of goods into and out of Gaza by air and sea.

Under the long-term blockade, the Gaza Strip is often described as a "prison-camp or open air prison for its collective denizens".

Israel also restricts movement of Palestinian residents between the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has implemented a policy of allowing Palestinian movement from the West Bank to Gaza, but making it quite difficult for Gaza residents to move to the West Bank. Israel typically refuses to allow Gaza residents to leave for the West Bank, even when the Gaza resident is originally a West Bank resident. The Israeli human rights organization [[Gisha (human rights organization)|Gisha]] has helped Gaza residents who had moved from the West Bank to Gaza return to the West Bank arguing that extremely pressing personal circumstances provide humanitarian grounds for relief.&lt;ref&gt;+972 Magazine, 30 June 2020 [https://www.972mag.com/gaza-movement-separation-policy/ "‘Gaza is a One-Way Ticket’: How Israel’s Relocation Policy is Separating Palestinian Communities--Israel Is Systemically Routing Palestinian Movement in One Direction — from the West Bank to Gaza"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy of the Gaza Strip is severely hampered by Egypt and Israel's almost total blockade, the high population density, limited land access, strict internal and external security controls, the effects of Israeli military operations, and restrictions on labor and trade access across the border. [[Per capita income]] (PPP) was estimated at US$3,100 in 2009, a position of 164th in the world.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; Seventy percent of the population is below the poverty line according to a 2009 estimate.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; Gaza Strip industries are generally small family businesses that produce [[textiles]], [[soap]], [[Olive#olive wood|olive-wood]] carvings, and [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] souvenirs.

The main agricultural products are [[olive]]s, [[citrus]], [[vegetable]]s, [[Halal]] [[beef]], and [[dairy products]]. Primary exports are citrus and [[cut flowers]], while primary imports are food, consumer goods, and construction materials. The main trade partners of the Gaza Strip are Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/gaza-strip/|title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;— Gaza Strip|year=2014|publisher=CIA|access-date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[EU]] described the Gaza economy as follows: "Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 and following the closure imposed by Israel, the situation in the Strip has been one of chronic need, de-development and donor dependency, despite a temporary relaxation on restrictions in movement of people and goods following a [[Gaza flotilla raid|flotilla raid]] in 2010. The closure has effectively cut off access for exports to traditional markets in Israel, transfers to the West Bank and has severely restricted imports. Exports are now down to 2% of 2007 levels."&lt;ref name="eccpalestine.org"/&gt;

According to Sara Roy, one senior IDF officer told an UNWRA official in 2015 that Israel's policy towards the Gaza Strip consisted of: "No development, no prosperity, no humanitarian crisis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sara Roy]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/the-gaza-strips-last-safety-net-is-in-danger/ 'The Gaza Strip’s Last Safety Net Is in Danger,'] [[The Nation]] 6 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Under Palestinian authority (1994-2007)}}

===After Oslo (1994–2007)===
Economic output in the Gaza Strip declined by about one-third between 1992 and 1996. This downturn was attributed to Israeli closure policies and, to a lesser extent, corruption and mismanagement by [[Yasser Arafat]]. Economic development has been hindered by Israel refusing to allow the operation of a sea harbour. A [[Gaza Seaport plans|seaport]] was planned to be built in Gaza with help from France and The Netherlands, but the project was bombed by Israel in 2001. Israel said that the reason for bombing was that Israeli settlements were being shot at from the construction site at the harbour. As a result, international transports (both trade and aid) had to go through Israel, which was hindered by the imposition of generalized border closures. These also disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the Strip. A serious negative social effect of this downturn was the emergence of high unemployment.

For its energy, Gaza is largely dependent on Israel either for import of electricity or fuel for its sole power plant. The [[Oslo Accords]] set limits for the Palestinian production and importation of energy. Pursuant to the Accords, the [[Israel Electric Corporation]] exclusively supplies the electricity (63% of the total consumption in 2013).&lt;ref name=unctad-2015&gt;[http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/tdb62d3_en.pdf ''Report on UNCTAD assistance to the Palestinian people: Developments in the economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory''], para 20.

Israel's use of comprehensive closures decreased over the next few years. In 1998, Israel implemented new policies to ease security procedures and allow somewhat freer movement of Gazan goods and labor into Israel. These changes led to three years of economic recovery in the Gaza Strip, disrupted by the outbreak of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] in the last quarter of 2000. Before the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000, around 25,000 workers from the Gaza Strip (about 2% of the population) worked in Israel on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g7NNG7m5AEfoCjIspXI7lya2LTFg |title=AFP |agency=AFP |date=10 October 2007 |access-date=1 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109054713/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g7NNG7m5AEfoCjIspXI7lya2LTFg |archive-date=9 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Intifada]] led to a steep decline in the economy of Gaza, which was heavily reliant upon external markets. Israel—which had begun its occupation by helping Gazans to plant approximately 618,000 trees in 1968, and to improve seed selection—over the first 3-year period of the second intifada, destroyed 10 percent of Gazan agricultural land, and uprooted 226,000 trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neve Gordon]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=4RX7t4X8_RMC&amp;pg=PA1  ''Israel's Occupation,''] University of California Press, 2008 pp.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The population became largely dependent on humanitarian assistance, primarily from UN agencies.&lt;ref name=CIAFB&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaza Strip|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/gaza-strip/|work=CIA World Fact Book|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (US)|access-date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The al-Aqsa Intifada triggered tight [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] closures of the border with Israel, as well as frequent curbs on traffic in Palestinian self-rule areas, severely disrupting trade and labor movements. In 2001, and even more so in early 2002, internal turmoil and Israeli military measures led to widespread business closures and a sharp drop in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Civilian infrastructure, such as the Palestine airport, was destroyed by Israel.&lt;ref name="zembla.vara.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zembla.vara.nl/Afleveringen.1973.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=11985&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1972&amp;cHash=585b6a76ce |title=Afleveringen |publisher=ZEMBLA |date=18 April 2010 |access-date=1 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529194740/http://zembla.vara.nl/Afleveringen.1973.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=11985&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1972&amp;cHash=585b6a76ce |archive-date=29 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major factor was a drop in income due to reduction in the number of Gazans permitted entry to work in Israel. After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the flow of a limited number of workers into Israel resumed, although Israel said it would reduce or end such permits due to the victory of [[Hamas]] in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|2006 parliamentary elections]].

The Israeli settlers of [[Gush Katif]] built [[greenhouse]]s and experimented with new forms of agriculture. These greenhouses provided employment for hundreds of Gazans. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005, more than 3,000 (about half) of the greenhouses were purchased with $14&amp;nbsp;million raised by former [[World Bank]] president [[James Wolfensohn]], and given to Palestinians to jump-start their economy. The rest were demolished by the departing settlers before there were offered a compensation as an inducement to leave them behind.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/international/middleeast/15mideast.html Israeli Settlers Demolish Greenhouses and Gaza Jobs] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The farming effort faltered due to limited water supply, Palestinian looting, restrictions on exports, and corruption in the Palestinian Authority. Many Palestinian companies repaired the greenhouses damaged and looted by the Palestinians after the Israeli withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/9331863 |title=Looters strip Gaza greenhouses |work=NBC News |date=13 September 2005 |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, Gaza businessmen envisaged a "magnificent future". $1.1&amp;nbsp;million was invested in an upscale restaurant, Roots, and plans were made to turn one of the Israeli settlements into a family resort.&lt;ref name="Bennet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/world/africa/with-israeli-departure-gazas-dreamers-emerge.html|title=With Israeli departure, Gaza's dreamers emerge|first=James|last=Bennet|date=15 August 2005|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following Hamas takeover (2007–present)===
The [[European Union]] states: "Gaza has experienced continuous economic decline since the imposition of a closure policy by Israel in 2007. This has had serious social and humanitarian consequences for many of its 1.7 million inhabitants. The situation has deteriorated further in recent months as a result of the geo-political changes which took place in the region during the course of 2013, particularly in Egypt and its closure of the majority of smuggling tunnels between Egypt and Gaza as well as increased restrictions at Rafah."&lt;ref name="eccpalestine.org"/&gt; Israel, the United States, Canada, and the European Union have frozen all funds to the Palestinian government after the formation of a Hamas-controlled government after its democratic victory in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election]]. They view the group as a [[terrorist]] organization, and have pressured Hamas to recognize Israel, renounce violence, and make good on past agreements. Prior to disengagement, 120,000 Palestinians from Gaza had been employed in Israel or in joint projects. After the Israeli withdrawal, the gross domestic product of the Gaza Strip declined. Jewish enterprises shut down, work relationships were severed, and job opportunities in Israel dried up. After the 2006 elections, fighting broke out between Fatah and Hamas, which Hamas won in the Gaza Strip on 14 June 2007. Israel imposed a blockade, and the only goods permitted into the Strip through the land crossings were goods of a humanitarian nature, and these were permitted in limited quantities.

An easing of Israel's closure policy in 2010 resulted in an improvement in some economic indicators, although exports were still restricted.&lt;ref name=CIAFB/&gt; According to the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the economy of the Gaza Strip improved in 2011, with a drop in unemployment and an increase in GDP. New malls opened and local industry began to develop. This economic upswing has led to the construction of hotels and a rise in the import of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idf.il/1283-12586-en/Dover.aspx |title=Economic improvement in the Gaza Strip |publisher=Idf.il |access-date=25 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213821/http://www.idf.il/1283-12586-en/Dover.aspx |archive-date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wide-scale development has been made possible by the unhindered movement of goods into Gaza through the [[Kerem Shalom Crossing]] and tunnels between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The current rate of trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom is 250 trucks per day. The increase in building activity has led to a shortage of construction workers. To make up for the deficit, young people are being sent to learn the trade in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Issacharoff |first=Avi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/egypt-s-holy-war-against-sinai-jihadists-leaves-many-questions-unanswered.premium-1.462551 |title=Egypt's holy war against Sinai jihadists leaves many questions unanswered |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=4 December 2012 |access-date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hamas leader [[Mahmoud Zahar]] said that Gaza's economic situation has improved and Gaza has become self-reliant "in several aspects except petroleum and electricity" despite Israel's blockade. Zahar said that Gaza's economic conditions are better than those in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="Zahar Maan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=520228 | title=Zahhar: Gaza more secure than West Bank | publisher=Maan | date=16 September 2012 | access-date=16 September 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024639/http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=520228 | archive-date=20 September 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[EU]]'s opinion was: "Today, Gaza is facing a dangerous and pressing humanitarian and economic situation with power outages across Gaza for up to 16 hours a day and, as a consequence, the closure of sewage pumping operations, reduced access to clean water; a reduction in medical supplies and equipment; the cessation of imports of construction materials; rising unemployment, rising prices and increased food insecurity. If left unaddressed, the situation could have serious consequences for stability in Gaza, for security more widely in the region as well as for the peace process itself."&lt;ref name="eccpalestine.org"/&gt;

====2012 fuel crisis====
Usually, diesel for Gaza came from Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogat.idf.il/Sip_Storage/FILES/1/2181.pdf |title=Humanitarian &amp; Civilian Activities towards the Gaza Strip |access-date=2014-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111233151/http://www.cogat.idf.il/Sip_Storage/FILES/1/2181.pdf |archive-date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011, Hamas started to buy cheaper fuel from Egypt, bringing it via a network of tunnels, and refused to allow it from Israel.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abu |first=Saud |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-18/hamas-rejects-egypt-plan-to-bring-gaza-fuel-via-israeli-crossing.html |title=Hamas Rejects Egypt Plan to Bring Gaza Fuel Via Israeli Crossing |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=18 February 2012 |access-date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, due to internal economic disagreement between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza, decreased supplies from Egypt and through tunnel smuggling, and Hamas's refusal to ship fuel via Israel, the Gaza Strip plunged into a fuel crisis, bringing increasingly long electricity shut downs and disruption of transportation. Egypt had attempted for a while to stop the use of tunnels for delivery of Egyptian fuel purchased by Palestinian authorities, and had severely reduced supply through the tunnel network. As the crisis broke out, Hamas sought to equip the Rafah terminal between Egypt and Gaza for fuel transfer, and refused to accept fuel to be delivered via the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=463087 |title=Gaza electricity crisis 'not solved' |publisher=maannews.net |access-date=25 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602152026/http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=463087 |archive-date=2 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-February 2012, as the crisis escalated, Hamas rejected an [[Egypt]]ian proposal to bring in fuel via the Kerem Shalom Crossing between Israel and Gaza to reactivate Gaza's only power plant. Ahmed Abu Al-Amreen of the Hamas-run Energy Authority refused it on the grounds that the crossing is operated by Israel and Hamas' fierce opposition to the existence of Israel. Egypt cannot ship [[diesel fuel]] to Gaza directly through the Rafah crossing point, because it is limited to the movement of individuals.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

In early March 2012, the head of Gaza's energy authority stated that Egypt wanted to transfer energy via the [[Kerem Shalom Crossing]], but he personally refused it to go through the "Zionist entity" (Israel) and insisted that Egypt transfer the fuel through the Rafah Crossing, although this crossing is not equipped to handle the half-million liters needed each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=محمد عنان |url=http://paltimes.net/details/news/11794/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84.html |title=مصر ستزود غزة بالوقود لشهر والطاقة تبحث البدائل |publisher=paltimes.net |date=4 March 2012 |access-date=25 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306115110/http://paltimes.net/details/news/11794/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84.html |archive-date=6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2012, Hamas began offering carpools for people to use Hamas state vehicles to get to work. Many Gazans began to wonder how these vehicles have fuel themselves, as diesel was completely unavailable in Gaza, ambulances could no longer be used, but Hamas government officials still had fuel for their own cars. Many Gazans said that Hamas confiscated the fuel it needed from petrol stations and used it exclusively for their own purposes.

Egypt agreed to provide 600,000 liters of fuel to Gaza daily, but it had no way of delivering it that Hamas would agree to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(1) السبت, 18 فبراير, 2012 |url=http://paltimes.net/details/news/11090/%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%80%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%80600-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7.html |title=نجيدة لـ"فلسطين الآن": مصر ستزود غزة بـ600 ألف لتر وقود يوميا |publisher=paltimes.net |date=18 February 2012 |access-date=25 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119065656/http://paltimes.net/details/news/11090/%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%80%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%80600-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7.html |archive-date=19 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Israel introduced a number of goods and vehicles into the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom Crossing, as well as the normal diesel for hospitals. Israel also shipped 150,000 liters of diesel through the crossing, which was paid for by the [[Red Cross]].

In April 2012, the issue was resolved as certain amounts of fuel were supplied with the involvement of the [[Red Cross]], after the Palestinian Authority and Hamas reached a deal. Fuel was finally transferred via the Israeli Kerem Shalom Crossing, which Hamas previously refused to transfer fuel from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=473827 |title=Fuel tankers arrive in Gaza |publisher=maannews.net |access-date=25 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602152753/http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=473827 |archive-date=2 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current budget====
Most of the Gaza Strip administration funding comes from outside as an aid, with large portion delivered by UN organizations directly to education and food supply. Most of the Gaza GDP comes as foreign humanitarian and direct economic support. Of those funds, the major part is supported by the U.S. and the European Union. Portions of the direct economic support have been provided by the Arab League, though it largely has not provided funds according to schedule. Among other alleged sources of Gaza administration budget is Iran.

A diplomatic source told Reuters that Iran had funded Hamas in the past with up to $300&amp;nbsp;million per year, but the flow of money had not been regular in 2011. "Payment has been in suspension since August," said the source.&lt;ref name="alarabiya3001"&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/01/30/191571.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401200105/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/01/30/191571.html |date=1 April 2012 }} "The head of the Hamas government in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, arrived in Qatar on Monday, beginning a regional tour that is also expected to take him to Kuwait, Bahrain and Iran."&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, some diplomatic sources said that Turkey promised to provide Haniyeh's Gaza Strip administration with $300&amp;nbsp;million to support its annual budget.&lt;ref name=alarabiya3001/&gt;

In April 2012, the Hamas government in Gaza approved its budget for 2012, which was up 25 percent year-on-year over 2011 budget, indicating that donors, including Iran, benefactors in the Islamic world, and Palestinian expatriates, are still heavily funding the movement.&lt;ref name=aa0204&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/02/204861.html |title=Iran, benefactors boost Hamas's 2012 budget |publisher=English.alarabiya.net |date=2 April 2012 |access-date=25 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710095346/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/02/204861.html |archive-date=10 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief of Gaza's parliament's budget committee Jamal Nassar said the 2012 budget is $769&amp;nbsp;million, compared to $630&amp;nbsp;million in 2011.&lt;ref name=aa0204/&gt;

==Geography and climate==
{{anchor|Geography}}
The Gaza Strip is located in the Middle East (at {{coord|31|25|N|34|20|E|region:PS_type:adm1st_scale:300000|display=inline,title}}). It has a {{convert|51|km|mi|sp=us}} border with [[Israel]], and an {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} border with [[Egypt]], near the city of [[Rafah]]. [[Khan Yunis]] is located {{convert|7|km|mi|sp=us}} northeast of Rafah, and several towns around [[Deir el-Balah]] are located along the coast between it and [[Gaza City]]. [[Beit Lahia]] and [[Beit Hanoun]] are located to the north and northeast of Gaza City, respectively. The [[Gush Katif]] bloc of Israeli settlements used to exist on the [[dune|sand dune]]s adjacent to Rafah and Khan Yunis, along the southwestern edge of the {{convert|40|km|mi|sp=us}} [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline. Al Deira beach is a popular venue for surfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/29/world/fg-gazasurf29 |title=In Gaza, surfers find peace and freedom riding the deep blue |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=23 August 2007 |access-date=25 January 2013 |first=Louise |last=Roug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaza Strip has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid climate]], with warm winters during which practically all the annual rainfall occurs, and dry, hot summers. Despite the dryness, humidity is high throughout the year. Annual rainfall is higher than in any   part of Egypt at around {{convert|300|to|400|mm|in|0}}, but almost all of this falls between November and February. The terrain is flat or rolling, with dunes near the coast. The highest point is Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda), at {{convert|105|m|ft|sp=us}} above [[sea level]]. Environmental problems include [[desertification]]; [[Biosalinity|salination]] of fresh water; [[sewage treatment]]; [[water-borne disease]]s; [[soil degradation]]; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources.

=== Geology ===
The [[topography]] of the Gaza Strip is dominated by three [[Ridge|ridges]] parallel to the coastline, which consist of [[Pleistocene]]-[[Holocene]] aged [[calcareous]] [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] (wind deposited) [[sandstone]]s, locally referred to as "[[kurkar]]", [[Interbedding|intercalated]] with red-coloured [[Grain size|fine grained]] [[paleosol]]s, referred to as "hamra". The three ridges are separated by [[wadi]]s, which are filled with [[Alluvium|alluvial deposits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UBEID|first=Khalid F.|date=2013|title=The  origin,  nature  and  stratigraphy  of   Pleistocene-Holocene  palaeosols  in  Wadi  Es-Salqa  (Gaza  Strip,  Palestine)|url=http://www.insugeo.org.ar/publicaciones/docs/scg-29-2-05.pdf|journal=Serie Correlación Geológica|volume=29|issue=2|pages=63-78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural resources ==

Natural resources of Gaza include [[arable land]]—about a third of the strip is irrigated. Recently, [[natural gas]] was discovered. The Gaza Strip is largely dependent on water from [[HaBesor Stream|Wadi Gaza]], which also supplies Israel.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clive Lipchin|author2=Eric Pallant|author3=Danielle Saranga|author4=Allyson Amster|title=Integrated Water Resources Management and Security in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rgHmpppZ-wC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-5986-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;million Palestinians lived in the Gaza Strip,&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; almost 1.0&amp;nbsp;million of them UN-registered refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/unrwa/refugees/gaza.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217211906/http://www.un.org/unrwa/refugees/gaza.html|archive-date=17 December 2007 |title=UNRWA: Palestine refugees |publisher=Un.org |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Palestinians descend from refugees who were driven from or left their homes during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The Strip's population has continued to increase since that time, one of the main reasons being a [[total fertility rate]] which peaked at 8.3 children per woman in 1991 and fell to 4.4 children per woman in 2013 which was still among the highest worldwide. In a [[List of countries by fertility rate|ranking by total fertility rate]], this places Gaza 34th of 224 regions.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|title=The reasons why Gaza's population is so young|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25993-the-reasons-why-gazas-population-is-so-young/|access-date=2020-12-27|website=New Scientist|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high total fertility rate also leads to the Gaza Strip having an unusually high proportion of children in the population, with 43.5% of the population being 14 or younger and in 2014 the median age was 18, compared to a world average of 28 and 30 in Israel. The only countries with a lower median age are countries in Africa such as Uganda where it was 15.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sunni Muslim]]s make up the predominant part of the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip. Most of the inhabitants are [[Sunni Muslims]], with an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 [[Arab Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4514822.stm Middle East Christians: Gaza pastor] BBC News, 21 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; making the region 99.8&amp;nbsp;percent [[Sunni Muslim]] and 0.2&amp;nbsp;percent Christian.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

===Religious compliance of population to Islam===
{{main|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}

====Islamic law in Gaza====
From 1987 to 1991, during the [[First Intifada]], Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the [[hijab]] head-cover and for other measures (such as the promotion of [[polygamy]], segregating women from men and insisting they stay at home).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the course of this campaign, women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed by Hamas activists, leading to hijabs being worn "just to avoid problems on the streets".&lt;ref name="Ruben"&gt;Rubenberg, C., ''Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank'' (USA, 2001) p.230-231&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, [[Islamic extremist]]s burned down the Windmill Hotel, owned by Basil Eleiwa, when they learned it had served alcohol.&lt;ref name="Bennet"/&gt;

Since Hamas took over in 2007, attempts have been made by Islamist activists to impose "[[Islamic dress]]" and to require women to wear the hijab.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/world/middleeast/06gaza.html Hamas Fights Over Gaza's Islamist Identity] New York Times, 5 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |title= Hamas encourages Gaza women to follow Islamic code |publisher= News.xinhuanet.com |date= 3 January 2010 |access-date= 21 May 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514030330/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |archive-date= 14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's "Islamic Endowment Ministry" has deployed [[Virtue Committee]] members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress, card playing and dating.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aB2RfynNbLmk Hamas Bans Women Dancers, Scooter Riders in Gaza Push] By Daniel Williams, Bloomberg, 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards, and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; There has also been successful resistance{{by whom|date=May 2015}} to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/18/hamas-gaza-islamist-dress-code Hamas patrols beaches in Gaza to enforce conservative dress code] The Guardian (UK), 18 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the Hamas-controlled government stepped up its efforts to "Islamize" Gaza in 2010, efforts it says included the "repression of civil society" and "severe violations of personal freedom."&lt;ref name=Esveld&gt;[https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/27/opinion/la-oe-vanesveld-gaza-20100627 "In Gaza, prisoners twice over; Palestinians are being squeezed by the Israeli blockade and Hamas' 'Islamizing' actions,"] Bill Van Esveld, Bill Van Esveld is a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, 27 June 2010, ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian researcher Khaled Al-Hroub has criticized what he called the "[[Taliban]]-like steps" Hamas has taken: "The Islamization that has been forced upon the Gaza Strip—the suppression of social, cultural, and press freedoms that do not suit Hamas's view[s]—is an egregious deed that must be opposed. It is the reenactment, under a religious guise, of the experience of [other] totalitarian regimes and dictatorships."&lt;ref&gt;The Hamas Enterprise and the Talibanization of Gaza, Khaled Al-Hroub, Al-Ayyam (Palestinian Authority), 11 October 2010. [http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4696.htm Translation] by the Middle East Research Institute, 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas officials denied having any plans to impose Islamic law. One legislator stated that "[w]hat you are seeing are incidents, not policy" and that "we believe in persuasion".&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

In October 2012 Gaza youth complained that security officers had obstructed their freedom to wear saggy pants and to have haircuts of their own choosing, and that they faced being arrested. Youth in Gaza are also arrested by security officers for wearing shorts and for showing their legs, which have been described by youth as embarrassing incidents, and one youth explained that "My saggy pants did not harm anyone." However, a spokesman for Gaza's Ministry of Interior denied such a campaign, and denied interfering in the lives of Gaza citizens, but explained that "maintaining the morals and values of the Palestinian society is highly required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/19/244663.html | title= Youths in Gaza complain of curbs against saggy pants, haircuts | work= Al Arabiya | date= 19 October 2012 | access-date= 21 October 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121020095521/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/19/244663.html | archive-date= 20 October 2012 | url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic politics====
Iran was the largest state supporter of Hamas, and the Muslim Brotherhood also gave support, but these political relationships have recently been disrupted following the [[Arab Spring]] by Iranian support for{{Clarify|date=December 2020}} and the position of Hamas has declined as support diminishes.&lt;ref name="eccpalestine.org"/&gt;

====Salafism====
In addition to Hamas, a [[Salafist]] movement began to appear about 2005 in Gaza, characterized by "a strict lifestyle based on that of the earliest followers of Islam".&lt;ref name=bbc-salafist&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knell|first1=Yolande|title=Can Hamas hold back Islamic State in Gaza?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33110099|access-date=16 September 2015|agency=BBC News|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, there are estimated to be only "hundreds or perhaps a few thousand" Salafists in Gaza.&lt;ref name=bbc-salafist/&gt; However, the failure of Hamas to lift the Israeli blockade of Gaza despite thousands of casualties and much destruction during [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008-9]] and [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014 wars]] has weakened Hamas's support and led some in Hamas to be concerned about the possibility of defections to the Salafist "[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]".&lt;ref name=bbc-salafist/&gt;

The movement has clashed with Hamas on a number of occasions. In 2009, a Salafist leader, Abdul Latif Moussa, declared an Islamic emirate in the town of Rafah, on Gaza's southern border.&lt;ref name=bbc-salafist/&gt; Moussa and 19 other people were killed when Hamas forces stormed his mosque and house. In 2011, Salafists abducted and murdered a pro-Palestinian Italian activist, [[Vittorio Arrigoni]]. Following this Hamas again took action to crush the Salafist groups.&lt;ref name=bbc-salafist/&gt;

===Violence against Christians===

Violence against Christians was recorded. The owner of a Christian bookshop was abducted and murdered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gazas-christian-bookseller-killed-396283.html |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Gaza's Christian bookseller killed |first=Eric |last=Silver |date=8 October 2007 |access-date=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 15 February 2008, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) library in Gaza City was bombed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Militants bomb Gaza YMCA library|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7246454.stm|access-date=17 June 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
The [[Gaza Museum of Archaeology]] was established by Jawdat N. Khoudary in 2008.&lt;ref name=nytimes08&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/world/middleeast/25gaza.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=archaeology&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin Museum Offers Gray Gaza a View of Its Dazzling Past, Ethan Bronner], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{See also|List of universities and colleges in the State of Palestine}}
[[File:Ucas1.jpg|thumb|[[University College of Applied Sciences]], the largest college in Gaza]]
In 2010, illiteracy among Gazan youth was less than 1%.  According to UNRWA figures, there are 640 schools in Gaza: 383 government schools, 221 [[UNRWA]] schools and 36 private schools, serving a total of 441,452 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imeu.net/news/article0017067.shtml |title=Children and education fact sheet |publisher=Imeu.net |access-date=12 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201010130/http://imeu.net/news/article0017067.shtml |archive-date=1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Al Zahara, a private school in central Gaza introduced a special program for mental development based on math computations. The program was created in Malaysia in 1993, according to the school principal, Majed al-Bari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52586 |title=This Math Class May Figure Out Israel |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=24 August 2010 |access-date=12 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010213508/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52586 |archive-date=10 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, some Gazans, upset that UNRWA did not rebuild their homes that were lost in the Second Intifada, blocked UNRWA from performing its services and shut down UNRWA's summer camps. Gaza residents also closed UNRWA's emergency department, social services office and ration stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=397614 |title=Gaza families shut down UN summer camps |publisher=Maan News Agency |access-date=25 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513231509/http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=397614 |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, there were five universities in the Gaza Strip and eight new schools were under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/world/middleeast/hamas-run-schools-in-gaza-set-out-to-teach-hebrew.html|title=Hamas-Run Schools in Gaza Set Out to Teach Hebrew|first=Jodi|last=Rudoren|date=22 May 2012|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, nine universities were open.

The Community College of Applied Science and Technology (CCAST) was established in 1998 in Gaza City. In 2003, the college moved into its new campus and established the Gaza Polytechnic Institute (GPI) in 2006 in southern Gaza. In 2007, the college received accreditation to award BA degrees as the [[University College of Applied Sciences]] (UCAS). In 2010, the college had a student population of 6,000 in eight departments offering over 40 majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.edu.ps/english/ucasview.aspx?pageid=47 |title=University College of Applied Sciences |publisher=Ucas.edu.ps |access-date=12 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511074016/http://www.ucas.edu.ps/english/ucasview.aspx?pageid=47 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
In Gaza, there are hospitals and additional healthcare facilities. Because of the high number of young people the [[mortality rate]] is one of the lowest in the world, at 0.315% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant mortality rate is ranked 105th highest out of 224 countries and territories, at 16.55 deaths per 1,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=Country Comparison: Infant mortality rate |publisher=CIA |access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaza Strip places 24th out of 135 countries according to [[Human Poverty Index]].

A study carried out by [[Johns Hopkins University]] (U.S.) and [[Al-Quds University]] (in [[Abu Dis]]) for [[Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere|CARE International]] in late 2002 revealed very high levels of dietary deficiency among the Palestinian population. The study found that 17.5% of children aged 6–59 months suffered from chronic [[malnutrition]]. 53% of women of reproductive age and 44% of children were found to be [[anemia|anemic]]. Insecurity in obtaining sufficient food as of 2016 affects roughly 70% of Gaza households, as the number of people requiring assistance from UN agencies has risen from 72,000 in 2000, to 800,000 in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=773119 '200 Gazans injured in separate incidents on first day of Eid al-Adha,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 13 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip health conditions in Gaza Strip faced new challenges. [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) expressed its concerns about the consequences of the Palestinian internal political fragmentation; the socioeconomic decline; military actions; and the physical, psychological and economic isolation on the health of the population in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/hac/crises/international/wbgs/sitrep_25sept2007/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; WHO statement on the situation in the Gaza Strip |publisher=Who.int |date=25 September 2007 |access-date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 study of the occupied territories, the WHO reported that roughly 50% of the young children and infants under two years old and 39.1% of pregnant women receiving antenatal services care in Gaza suffer from iron-deficiency anemia. The organization also observed chronic malnutrition in children under five "is not improving and may be deteriorating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem and the occupied Syrian Golan|date=11 May 2012|publisher=World Health Organization|page=2|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_3973.pdf|access-date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare availability===

According to Palestinian leaders in the Gaza Strip, the majority of medical aid delivered are "past their expiration date." Mounir el-Barash, the director of donations in Gaza's health department, claims 30% of aid sent to Gaza is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=182120 |title=Report: Gaza medical aid is expired |publisher=Jpost.com |access-date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}

==Culture and sports==
[[File:مدينة أصداء.jpg|thumb|Gaza amusement park.]]

===Fine arts===
The Gaza Strip has been home to a significant branch of the contemporary Palestinian art movement since the mid 20th century. Notable artists include painters Ismail Ashour, Shafiq Redwan, Bashir Senwar, Majed Shalla, Fayez Sersawi, Abdul Rahman al Muzayan and Ismail Shammout, and media artists Taysir Batniji (who lives in France) and [[Laila Shawa|Laila al Shawa]] (who lives in London). An emerging generation of artists is also active in nonprofit art organizations such as Windows From Gaza and Eltiqa Group, which regularly host exhibitions and events open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2009/farhat160109.html|title=Maymanah Farhat, "Under the Voices of Fire: Artists in Gaza"|author=Yoshie Furuhashi|work=monthlyreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
In 2010, Gaza inaugurated its first [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] at the [[As-Sadaka]] club. The opening ceremony was held by the Islamic Society.&lt;ref name=Maan&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=285242 Gaza opens first Olympic-size swimming pool], 18 May 2010, Ma'an News Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; The swimming team of as-Sadaka holds several gold and silver medals from Palestinian swimming competitions.&lt;ref name="sadaka"&gt;[http://www.alsadaka.ps/index.php/archives/604 السباحة صالة الالعاب الرياضية والساونا في النادي] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511202713/http://www.alsadaka.ps/index.php/archives/604 |date=11 May 2011 }}, as-Sadaka Athletics Club&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport and communications==
[[File:Gaza airport 03.jpg|thumb|Damaged part of Gaza airport, May 2002]]

===Transport===
The [[Oslo Accords]] ceded control of the [[airspace]] and [[territorial waters]] to Israel. Any external travel from Gaza requires cooperation from either Egypt or Israel.

====Highways====

[[Salah al-Din Road]] (also known as the Salah ad-Deen Highway) is the main highway of the Gaza Strip and extends over {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}}, spanning the entire length of the territory from the [[Rafah Crossing]] in the south to the [[Erez Crossing]] in the north.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;Cunningham, Erin.

====Rail transport====
From 1920 to 1948, the Gaza Strip hosted sections of the [[Palestine Railways]], connecting the region with Egypt.

====Marine transport====

The [[Port of Gaza]] has been an important and active port since antiquity. Despite [[Gaza Seaport Plans|plans]] under the [[Oslo I Accord|Oslo Peace Accords]] to expand the port, it has been under a [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] since Hamas was elected as a majority party in the 2006 elections. Both [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip#Naval blockade|the Israeli Navy]] and Egypt enforce the blockade, which continues currently and has limited many aspects of life in Gaza, especially, according to Human Rights Watch, the movement of people and commerce, with exports being most affected. The improvement and rebuilding of infrastructure is also negatively impacted by these sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Report 2015: Israel/Palestine – Events of 2014|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/israel/palestine|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to expand the port were halted after the outbreak of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]].

====Air transport====

The [[Yasser Arafat International Airport]] opened on 24 November 1998 after the signing of the [[Oslo II Accord]] and the [[Wye River Memorandum]]. It was closed by Israel in October 2000. Its radar station and control tower were destroyed by Israel Defense Forces aircraft in 2001 during the al-Aqsa Intifada, and bulldozers razed the runway in January 2002.&lt;ref name=msnbc_fly_again&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/7900217 ''Grounded in Gaza, but hoping to fly again''], NBC News, 19 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2005&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4449461.stm ''Years of delays at Gaza airport''], [[Alan Johnston|Johnston, Alan]]. BBC News, 15 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The only remaining runway in the strip, at the [[Gush Katif Airport]], fell into disuse following Israeli disengagement. The airspace over Gaza may be restricted by the [[Israeli Air Force]] as the [[Oslo Accords]] authorized.

===Telecommunications===

====Telephone service====

The Gaza Strip has rudimentary land line telephone service provided by an open-wire system, as well as extensive mobile telephone services provided by [[PalTel]] (Jawwal) and Israeli providers such as [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]]. Gaza is serviced by four [[internet service provider]]s that now compete for [[ADSL]] and dial-up customers.

====Television and radio====
In 2004, most Gaza households had a radio and a TV (70%+), and approximately 20% had a [[personal computer]].
