Historically, when people were enslaved, it was often because they were indebted, or broke the law, or suffered a military defeat, and the duration of their enslavement was either for life or for a fixed period of time after which freedom was granted.&lt;ref&gt;Baker-Kimmons, Leslie C. "Slavery" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;pg=PT1360 Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society]'', Volume 3, p. 1234 (edited by Richard T. Schaefer, [[SAGE Publishing]], 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals, then, usually became slaves involuntarily, due to force or [[Involuntary servitude|coercion]], although there was also [[voluntary slavery]] to pay a debt or obtain money for some purpose. In the course of human history, slavery was a typical feature of [[civilization]],&lt;ref name="Slavery"/&gt; and legal in most societies, but it is now [[Abolition of slavery timeline|outlawed]] in all countries of the world, except as [[penal labor|punishment for crime]].{{sfn|Bales|2004|p=4}}&lt;ref name="WhiteWhite2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Shelley K. |first2=Jonathan M. |last2=White|first3=Kathleen Odell |last3=Korgen |title=Sociologists in Action on Inequalities: Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GsruAwAAQBAJ|page=43}}|date=2014|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4833-1147-0|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''chattel slavery'', the enslaved person is legally rendered the [[personal property]] (chattel) of the slave owner. In economics, the term ''de facto slavery'' describes the conditions of [[unfree labour]] and [[forced labour]] that most slaves endure.&lt;ref name="newint"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery in the 21st century|url=http://www.newint.org/issue337/facts.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095857/http://www.newint.org/issue337/facts.htm|archive-date=May 27, 2010|access-date=August 29, 2010|publisher=Newint.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, approximately 40 million people, of whom 26 percent were children, were enslaved throughout the world despite it being illegal. In the modern world, more than 50 percent of enslaved people provide [[forced labour]], usually in the factories and sweatshops of the [[private sector]] of a country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kate |last1=Hodal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/25/modern-slavery-trafficking-persons-one-in-200|title=One in 200 people is a slave.

==Terminology{{anchor|Types}}==
The word slave arrived in English via the [[Old French]] {{Lang|fro|sclave}}. In [[Medieval Latin]] the word was {{Lang|la-x-medieval|sclavus}} and in [[Byzantine Greek]] {{Lang|grc-x-medieval|σκλάβος}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Use of the word arose during the [[Early Medieval Period]], when [[Slavs]] from Central and Eastern Europe (''[[Saqaliba]]'') were frequently enslaved by [[Moors]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jankowiak |first1=Marek |title=What Does the Slave Trade in the Saqaliba Tell Us about Early Islamic Slavery? |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |date=February 2017 |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=169–172 |doi=10.1017/S0020743816001240 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/what-does-the-slave-trade-in-the-saqaliba-tell-us-about-early-islamic-slavery/EDDD35D8FD593AB8D576D11550CF62C6|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The international slave trade |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/slavery-sociology/The-international-slave-trade |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|1992|loc=Chapter 1}}

There is a dispute among historians about whether terms such as "[[unfree labour]]er" or "'''enslaved person'''", rather than "slave", should be used when describing the victims of slavery. According to those proposing a change in terminology, ''slave'' perpetuates the crime of slavery in language by reducing its victims to a nonhuman noun instead of "carry[ing] them forward as people, not the property that they were". Other historians prefer ''slave'' because the term is familiar and shorter, or because it accurately reflects the inhumanity of slavery, with ''person'' implying a degree of autonomy that slavery does not allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/historians_debate_whether_to_use_the_term_slave_or_enslaved_person.html?wpsrc=sp_all_native_by-section|title=Slave or Enslaved Person?

===Chattel slavery===
As a social institution, chattel slavery ('''traditional slavery''') denies the [[Agency (sociology)|human agency]] of people, by legally dehumanising them into ''chattels'' ([[personal property]]) owned by the slaver; therefore slaves give birth to slaves; the children of slaves are born enslaved, under legal doctrines, such as ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'' ("That which is brought forth follows the belly").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery in the Modern World|last=Frost|first=Dan|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=978-1-85109-783-8|editor-last=Rodriguez|editor-first=Junius P.|volume=1|page=182|chapter=Chattel Slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also may be bought and sold at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brace|first=Laura|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=osZnIiqDd4sC|page=162}}|title=The Politics of Pr operty: Labour, Freedom and Belonging|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7486-1535-3|page=162|access-date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although chattel slavery was the usual form of enslavement in most societies that practiced slavery throughout human history, since the 19th century, this form of slavery was formally abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/slavery/contemporary/essay-chattel-slavery.html|title=Traditional or Chattel Slavery|website=FSE Project|publisher=The Feminist Sexual Ethics Project|access-date=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of [[sexual slavery]], often in military contexts, include detention in "rape camps" or "comfort stations," "[[comfort women]]", forced "marriages" to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women or men as chattel and, as such, violations of the peremptory norm prohibiting slavery.&lt;ref name="iclklamberg.com"&gt;{{Citation| title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=International Criminal Law Database &amp; Commentary |page= footnotes: [http://www.iclklamberg.com/Statute.htm#_ftn29 29] , 82, 107}} {{dead link|date=February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="juridicas.unam.mx"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acuña |first1=Tathiana Flores |date=January 2004 |title=The Rome Statute's Sexual Related Crimes: an Appraisal under the Light of International Humanitarian Law |url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/librev/rev/iidh/cont/39/pr/pr7.pdf |journal=Revista Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos |volume=1 |issue=39 |pages=29–30 |access-date=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/modern_1.shtml#section_2|title=Ethics – Slavery: Modern slavery|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Gulnara Shahinian|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session21/A-HRC-21-41_en.pdf|website=ohchr.org|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council|access-date=October 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060954/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session21/A-HRC-21-41_en.pdf|archive-date=September 21, 2013 |date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonded labour===
{{Main|Debt bondage}}
{{Seealso|Money marriage}}
Indenture, otherwise known as bonded labour or debt bondage, is a form of unfree labour under which a person pledges himself or herself against a loan. The services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined. Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their progenitors' debt.{{sfn|Bales|2004|pp=15–18}} It is the most widespread form of slavery today.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Debt bondage is most prevalent in South Asia.{{sfn|Bales|2004|pp=15–18}} [[Money marriage]] refers to a marriage where a girl, usually, is married off to a man to settle debts owed by her parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/nigerias-young-daughters-sold-money-wives-180921153424671.html|title=Nigeria's young daughters are sold as 'money wives'|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=12 May 2020|date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependents===
The word "slavery" has also been used to refer to a legal state of dependency to somebody else.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery and South Asian History|first1=Indrani |last1=Chatterjee|first2=Richard|last2= Eaton|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-253-11671-0|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Dandamayev, Barda and Bardadārī in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], the situations and lives of such slaves could be better than those of common citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Farazmand, Ali (1998) "Persian/Iranian Administrative Tradition", in Jay M. Shafritz (Editor), ''International Encyclopedia of Public Edict and Administration''. Boulder, CO: [[Westview Press]], pp. 1640–1645&amp;nbsp;– Excerpt: "Persians never practiced mass slavery, and in many cases the situations and lives of semi-slaves (prisoners of war) were in fact better than the common citizens of Persia." (p. 1642)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Unfree labour}}
{{Seealso|Human trafficking}} 
Forced labour, or unfree labour, is sometimes used to describe an individual who is forced to work against their own will, under threat of violence or other punishment, but the generic term unfree labour is also used to describe chattel slavery, as well as any other situation in which a person is obliged to work against their own will, and a person's ability to work productively is under the complete control of another person.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} This may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery, such as [[serfdom]], [[conscription]] and [[penal labour]]. While some unfree labourers, such as [[serf]]s, have substantive, ''de jure'' legal or traditional rights, they also have no ability to terminate the arrangements under which they work and are frequently subject to forms of coercion, violence, and restrictions on their activities and movement outside their place of work.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Human trafficking primarily involves women and children forced into [[prostitution]] and is the fastest growing form of forced labour, with Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico having been identified as leading hotspots of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]].&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human+rights+and+law |title=Experts encourage action against sex trafficking |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223080032/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human%2Brights%2Band%2Blaw |archive-date=December 23, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/08/rights-mexico-16000-victims-of-child-sexual-exploitation/|title=Rights–Mexico: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation|website=ipsnews.net|date=August 13, 2007|access-date=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses of the term===
The word ''slavery'' is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing. Some argue that [[Conscription#Military slavery|military drafts]] and other forms of coerced government labour constitute "state-operated slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2346 |title=An Idea Not Worth Drafting: Conscription is Slavery |first=Peter |last=Krembs |date=January 20, 2003 |publisher=Capmag.com |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidkopel.com/NRO/2001/Nationalized-Slavery.htm |title=Nationalized Slavery; A policy Italy should dump |website=davidkopel.com |author-link=Dave Kopel |first=Dave|last=Kopel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012125652/http://www.davidkopel.com/NRO/2001/Nationalized-Slavery.htm |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |url-status=dead}}.

"Slavery" has been used by some [[Antipsychiatry|anti-psychiatry]] proponents to define involuntary psychiatric patients, claiming there are no unbiased physical tests for mental illness and yet the psychiatric patient must follow the orders of the psychiatrist.

Some proponents of [[animal rights]] have applied the term ''slavery'' to the condition of some or all human-owned animals, arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves.&lt;ref name="MSpiegel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spiegel|first=Marjorie|title=The Dreaded Comparison: Human and Animal Slavery|location=New York|publisher=Mirror Books|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The labour market, as institutionalized under today's market economic systems, has been criticized by mainstream [[Socialism|socialists]] and by [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], who utilise the term [[wage slavery]] as a [[pejorative]] or [[dysphemism]] for [[wage labour]].&lt;ref&gt;For sources about the concept of ''"wage slavery"'' and its various interpretations, see {{cite dictionary |title= wage slave |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wage-slave |dictionary= dictionary.com |access-date= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ellerman|1992}}&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= merriam-webster.com |access-date= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery. [[Cicero]] is also known to have suggested such parallels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Constitution Society – Advocates and enforcers of the U.S. and State Constitutions|url=https://constitution.org|access-date=2021-02-06|quote=...vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists have modeled the circumstances under which slavery (and variants such as [[serfdom]]) appear and disappear. One observation is that slavery becomes more desirable for [[Land tenure|landowners]] where land is abundant but labour is scarce, such that rent is depressed and paid workers can demand high wages. If the opposite holds true, then it is more costly for landowners to guard the slaves than to employ paid workers who can demand only low wages because of the degree of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=North|first1=Douglass C.|first2=Robert Paul|last2= Thomas |title=The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Theoretical Model|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=December 1971|volume=31|issue=4|pages=777–803|jstor=2117209|doi=10.1017/S0022050700074623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in Europe as the population grew. They were reintroduced in the Americas and in Russia as large areas of land with few inhabitants became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Domar|first=Evsey D.|title=The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=March 1970|volume=30|issue=1|pages=18–32|jstor=2116721|doi=10.1017/S0022050700078566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery is more common when the tasks are relatively simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale [[Monocropping|monocrops]] such as [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]], in which output depended on [[economies of scale]]. This enables systems of labour, such as the [[gang system]] in the United States, to become prominent on large plantations where field hands toiled with factory-like precision. Then, each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that assigned every member of the gang to a task and made each worker's performance dependent on the actions of the others. The enslaved chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excess sprouts. Plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an [[assembly line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lagerlöf|first1=Nils-Petter |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/372.html |title=Slavery and other property rights |journal=MPRA Paper 372 |date=November 12, 2006 |access-date=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 18th century, critics have argued that slavery retards technological advancement because the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading their efficiency. For example, it is sometimes argued that, because of this narrow focus, technology in Greece – and later in Rome – was not applied to ease physical labour or improve manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=223811|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423152702/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=223811|archive-date=April 23, 2008 |title=Technology |publisher=History.com |date=January 4, 2008 |access-date=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fathers of the Redemption.jpg|thumb|The work of the [[Mercedarians]] was in ransoming Christian slaves held in North Africa (1637).]]

Scottish economist [[Adam Smith]] stated that free labour was economically better than slave labour, and that it was nearly impossible to end slavery in a free, democratic, or republican form of government since many of its legislators or political figures were slave owners, and would not punish themselves. He further stated that slaves would be better able to gain their freedom under centralized government, or a central authority like a king or church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John R. |last1=McKivigan|first2=Mitchell |last2=Snay|title=Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e-unV4v5puYC|page=68}}|access-date=May 31, 2012|year=1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2076-2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles L. |last=Griswold|title=Adam Smith and the Virtues of Enlightenment|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WRcU_GJAc9gC|page=198}}|access-date=May 31, 2012|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62891-4|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments appeared later in the works of [[Auguste Comte]], especially given Smith's belief in the [[separation of powers]], or what Comte called the "separation of the spiritual and the temporal" during the [[Middle Ages]] and the end of slavery, and Smith's criticism of masters, past and present. As Smith stated in the ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'', "The great power of the clergy thus concurring with that of the king set the slaves at liberty. But it was absolutely necessary both that the authority of the king and of the clergy should be great. Where ever any one of these was wanting, slavery still continues..."{{sfn|Forbes|1998|p=74}}

Even after slavery became a criminal offense, slave owners could get high returns. According to researcher [[Siddharth Kara]], the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2&amp;nbsp;billion. That was second only to drug trafficking, in terms of global criminal enterprises. At the time the weighted average global sales price of a slave was estimated to be approximately $340, with a high of $1,895 for the average trafficked sex slave, and a low of $40 to $50 for debt bondage slaves in part of Asia and Africa. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labour and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave. Approximately 40% of slave profits each year were generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the world's 29&amp;nbsp;million slaves.&lt;ref name="Dhaliwal"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kara|first=Siddharth|title=Sex Trafficking – Inside the Business of Modern Slavery|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, slaves were clothed in a distinctive fashion, particularly with respect to the frequent lack of footwear, as they were rather commonly forced to go [[barefoot]]. This was partly for economic reasons, but also served as a distinguishing feature, especially in South Africa and South America. For example, the [[Cape Town]] slave code stated that "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes."&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds|url=https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/places-slave-rememberance-western-cape?toc_page=3|publisher=westerncape.gov.za|access-date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also puts slaves at a physical disadvantage because of the lack of protection against environmental conditions and in confrontations, thereby making it more difficult to escape or to rebel against their owners.

This was the case in the majority of states. Most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot.&lt;ref name="slavery_brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery in Brazil|url=http://histclo.com/act/work/slave/am/cou/bra/sab-sla.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing|access-date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Riemer stated, "[the slaves] are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted."&lt;ref name="living_conditions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living conditions of slaves|url=http://surinamslavery.blogspot.com/2008/10/chapter-6-living-conditions-of-slaves.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing|access-date=July 18, 2012|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bible, shoes have been considered badges of freedom since antiquity: "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet" ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:22|KJV}}). This aspect can be viewed as an informal law in areas where slavery existed as any person sighted barefoot in public was assumed to be a slave.

In certain societies this rule continues. The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] still unofficially practice slavery and force their slaves to remain barefoot.&lt;ref name="Sklaven barfuss bei Tuareg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scheen |first1=Thomas |title=Niger: Ehemalige Sklavin erhält Entschädigung |url=https://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E19E0D1A29403492E9787E7A392A3FFAE~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |access-date=October 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031151116/https://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E19E0D1A29403492E9787E7A392A3FFAE~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |archive-date=October 31, 2008 |location=Johannesburg |language=de |date=28 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}{{qn|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widespread practice was [[human branding|branding]], either to explicitly mark them as property or as punishment.

===Legal rights===
Depending upon the era and the country, slaves sometimes had a limited set of legal rights.  For example, in the [[Province of New York]], people who deliberately killed slaves were punishable under a 1686 statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pollak|first=Michael|date=2014-03-28|title=Determining the Legal Rights of Slaves|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/nyregion/determining-the-legal-rights-of-slaves.html|access-date=2021-02-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, as already mentioned, certain legal rights attached to the nobi in Korea, to enslaved people in various African societies, and to black female slaves in the [[Louisiana (New France)|French colony of Louisiana]].  Giving slaves legal rights has sometimes been a matter of morality, but also sometimes a matter of self-interest.  For example, in [[Classical Athens|ancient Athens]], protecting slaves from mistreatment simultaneously protected people who might be mistaken for slaves, and giving slaves limited property rights incentivized slaves to work harder to get more property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ober|first=Josiah|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hYZeDwAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0|page=112}}|title=Athenian Legacies: Essays on the Politics of Going On Together|date=2018-06-26|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-19016-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern United States prior to [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the extirpation of slavery in 1865]], a proslavery legal treatise reported that slaves accused of crimes typically had a legal right to counsel, freedom from [[double jeopardy]], a right to trial by jury in graver cases, and the right to grand jury indictment, but they lacked many other rights such as white adults’ ability to control their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Thomas.  ''An Inquiry into the Law of Negro Slavery in the United States of America'', pp. 268–269 (Univ. of Ga. Press 1999) (1858).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Some scholars differentiate ancient forms of slavery from the largely race-based slavery. The first type of slavery, sometimes called "just title servitude", was inflicted on [[prisoners of war]], debtors, and other vulnerable people. Race-based slavery grew to immense proportions starting in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panzer |first1=Joel S. |title=The Popes and Slavery |date=1996 |publisher=Alba House |isbn=0-8189-0764-9 |page=3}}"The earlier forms of servitude were varied, complex, and very often of a different sociological category than those which were prevalent after the 14th century. While all forms of servitude are certainly unacceptable to most people today, this has not always been the case. Formerly, the rules of war and society were such that servitude was often imposed as a penalty on criminals and prisoners of war, and was even freely chosen by many workers for economic reasons. Children born of those held in servitude were also at times considered to be in the same state as that of their parents. These types of servitude were the most common among those generally considered to establish the so-called 'just titles' of servitude."&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued even by some contemporary writers to be intrinsically immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sicut Dudem -Against the Enslavement of Black Natives of the Canary Islands |url=https://www.papalencyclicals.net/eugene04/eugene04sicut.htm |website=papalencyclicals.net|date=January 13, 1435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sublimus Dei – On the Enslavement and Evangelization of Indians |url=https://www.papalencyclicals.net/Paul03/p3subli.htm |website=papalencyclicals.net|date=May 29, 1537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hanke |first1=Lewis |title=All Mankind Is One: A Study of the Disputation Between Bartolomé de Las Casas and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda on the Religious and Intellectual Capacity of the American Indians |date=1974 |publisher=Northern Illinois University Press |isbn=0-87580-043-2 |page=xi}}"For the first time, and probably for the last, a colonizing nation organized a formal enquiry into the justice of the methods used to extend its empire.

[[File:Mines 1.jpg|thumb|Corinthian black-figure terra-cotta votive tablet of slaves working in a mine, dated to the late seventh century BC]]
Slavery predates written records and has existed in many cultures.&lt;ref name="Slavery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Historical survey: Slave-owning societies |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223090720/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |archive-date=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slavery is rare among [[hunter-gatherer]] populations because it requires economic surpluses and a substantial population density. Thus, although it has existed among unusually resource-rich hunter gatherers, such as the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] peoples of the [[salmon]]-rich rivers of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast, slavery became widespread only with the invention of agriculture during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] about 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="ebhellie"/&gt;

In the earliest known records, slavery is treated as an established institution. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1760&amp;nbsp;BC), for example, prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave escape or who sheltered a fugitive.&lt;ref name="wsu. edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |title=Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi|quote=e.g. Prologue, "the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves".

During the [[trans-Saharan slave trade]], slaves from [[West Africa]] were transported across the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]] to [[North Africa]] to be sold to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East|Middle eastern]] civilizations. The [[Indian Ocean slave trade]], sometimes known as the east African slave trade, was multi-directional. Africans were sent as slaves to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], to [[Indian Ocean]] islands (including [[Madagascar]]), to the [[Indian subcontinent]], and later to the Americas. These traders captured [[Bantu peoples]] ([[Zanj]]) from the interior in present-day [[Kenya]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]] and brought them to the coast.&lt;ref name="Och"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochiengʼ|first1=William Robert|title=Eastern Kenya and Its Invaders|date=1975|publisher=East African Literature Bureau|page=76|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ziJyAAAAMAAJ|access-date= May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogot"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Bethwell A. |last=Ogot|author-link=Bethwell A.

Slavery also existed in [[Slavery in India|India]], [[Slavery in Japan|Japan]] and [[Slavery in Vietnam|Vietnam]].

===== China =====
{{See also|Slavery in China}}
Many [[Han Chinese]] were enslaved in the process of the [[Mongol conquest of China|Mongol invasion]] of [[China proper]].{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|pp=146-147}} According to Japanese historians Sugiyama Masaaki (杉山正明) and Funada Yoshiyuki (舩田善之), Mongolian slaves were owned by [[Han Chinese]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;杉山正明《忽必烈的挑战》，社会科学文献出版社，2013年，第44–46頁&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;船田善之《色目人与元代制度、社会 – 重新探讨蒙古、色目、汉人、南人划分的位置》,〈蒙古学信息〉2003年第2期&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery in Korea]] existed since before the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, {{Circa|0}}.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|pp=392-393}} Slavery has been described as "very important in medieval Korea, probably more important than in any other [[East Asian]] country, but by the 16th century, population growth was making [it] unnecessary".&lt;ref name="Klein2014"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin A.|last= Klein|title=Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ULeCBAAAQBAJ|page=13}}|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-8108-7528-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery went into decline around the 10th century but came back in the late [[Goryeo]] period when Korea also experienced multiple [[slave rebellion]]s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|pp=392-393}}

In the [[Joseon]] period of Korea, members of the slave class were known as ''nobi''. The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen (i.e., the [[Chungin|middle]] and [[Sangmin|common]] classes) other than the ruling [[yangban]] class, and some possessed property rights, and legal and civil rights.

[[Slavery in medieval Europe|Slavery in early medieval Europe]] was so common that the [[Catholic Church]] repeatedly prohibited it, or at least the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands, as for example at the [[Koblenz#Middle Ages|Council of Koblenz]] (922), the [[Council of London (1102)]] (which aimed mainly at the sale of English slaves to Ireland)&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Hugh|author-link1=Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|title=The Slave Trade: History of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440–1870|date=2006|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=978-0-7538-2056-8|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Council of Armagh (1171). [[Serfdom]], on the contrary, was widely accepted. In 1452, [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[papal bull]] [[Dum Diversas]], granting the kings of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any "Saracens (Muslims), pagans and any other unbelievers" to perpetual slavery, legitimizing the slave trade as a result of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Curran|editor-first=Charles E.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=gghti96kHscC|page=67}}|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teachings|date=2003|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4134-0|last=Hayes|first= Diana |chapter=Reflections on Slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his [[Romanus Pontifex]] bull of 1455.

Slavery had never been authorized by statute within England and Wales, and in 1772, in the case [[Somerset v Stewart]], Lord Mansfield declared that it was also unsupported within England by the common law. The slave trade was abolished by the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], although slavery remained legal in possessions outside Europe until the passage of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] and the [[Indian Slavery Act, 1843]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Saxon Slave-Market in Bristol|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/bristol/saxonslaves.shtml|access-date=2021-02-06|website=Building History |date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when England began to have colonies in the Americas, and particularly from the 1640s, African slaves began to make their appearance in England and remained a presence until the eighteenth century. In Scotland, slaves continued to be sold as chattels until late in the eighteenth century (on the 2nd May, 1722, an advertisement appeared in the "Edinburgh Evening Courant", announcing that a stolen slave had been found, who would be sold to pay expenses, unless claimed within two weeks).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | access-date = 2 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For nearly two hundred years in the [[history of coal mining]] in Scotland, miners were bonded to their "maisters" by a 1606 Act "Anent Coalyers and Salters". The [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]] stated that "many colliers and salters are in a state of slavery and bondage" and announced emancipation; those starting work after 1 July 1775 would not become slaves, while those already in a state of slavery could, after 7 or 10 years depending on their age, apply for a decree of the Sheriff's Court granting their freedom. Few could afford this, until a further law in 1799 established their freedom and made this slavery and bondage illegal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=James |last1=Barrowman |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | access-date = 2 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs recruited many Zanj slaves as soldiers and, as early as 696, there were slave revolts of the Zanj against their Arab enslavers in Iraq. The [[Zanj Rebellion]], a series of uprisings that took place between 869 and 883 near [[Basra]] (also known as Basara), situated in present-day Iraq, is believed to have involved enslaved Zanj that had originally been captured from the [[African Great Lakes]] region and areas further south in [[East Africa]].{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007a|p=585}} It grew to involve over 500,000 slaves and free men who were imported from across the [[Muslim empire]] and claimed over "tens of thousands of lives in lower Iraq".&lt;ref name="Furlonge"&gt;{{cite web |last=Asquith |first=Christina |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-76402507/revisiting-the-zanj-and-re-visioning-revolt-complexities |title=Revisiting the Zanj and Re-Visioning Revolt: Complexities of the Zanj Conflict – 868–883 AD – slave revolt in Iraq |publisher= |access-date= |archive-date=March 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306155327/https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-76402507/revisiting-the-zanj-and-re-visioning-revolt-complexities |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis' numbers have been refuted by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Earle/&gt; In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia.  Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.

Systems of servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa, as they were in much of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. In many African societies where slavery was prevalent, the enslaved people were not treated as [[#Chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] and were given certain rights in a system similar to [[indentured servitude]] elsewhere in the world. The forms of slavery in Africa were closely related to [[kinship]] structures.

When the [[Atlantic slave trade]] began, many of the local slave systems began supplying captives for chattel slave markets outside Africa. Although the Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M’bokolo wrote in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'':

Four million enslaved people exported via the [[Red Sea]], another four million through the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the [[Trans-Saharan trade|trans-Saharan]] caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=M'bokolo|first=Elikia|date=1998-04-01|title=The impact of the slave trade on Africa|url=https://mondediplo.com/1998/04/02africa|access-date=2021-02-07|publisher=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The trans-Atlantic slave trade peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by [[List of kingdoms in pre-colonial Africa|African kingdoms]], such as the [[Oyo Empire]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), the [[Ashanti Empire]],&lt;ref name="apology"/&gt; the kingdom of [[Dahomey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm|access-date=2021-02-06|website=www.metmuseum.org|title=The Transatlantic Slave Trade] |first=Alexander Ives |last=Bortolot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Aro Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/404.htm|access-date=2021-02-06|website=countrystudies.us|title=Nigeria – The Slave Trade|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that about 15 percent of slaves died during the [[Middle Passage|voyage]], with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous peoples to the ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Rubinstein | first= W.D.| title= Genocide: a history| url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC|page=76}}| publisher= Pearson Education| year= 2004| pages= 76–78| isbn= 978-0-582-50601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mancke|first1=Elizabeth|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=gsYlogeOEgYC|page=30}}|title=The Creation of the British Atlantic World|last2=Shammas|first2=Carole|pages=30–31|date=2005-05-31|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in America remains a contentious issue and played a major role in the history and evolution of some countries, triggering a [[Haitian Revolution|revolution]], [[American Civil War|a civil war]], and numerous rebellions.

In order to establish itself as an American empire, Spain had to fight against the relatively powerful civilizations of the [[New World]]. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas included using the Natives as forced labour. The [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Spanish colonies]] were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on islands such as [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2028.html?countryName=Haiti&amp;countryCode=ha&amp;regionCode=ca&amp;#ha|title=The World Factbook|website=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], a 16th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and Spanish historian, participated in campaigns in Cuba (at [[Bayamo]] and [[Camagüey]]) and was present at the massacre of [[Hatuey]]; his observation of that massacre led him to fight for a social movement away from the use of natives as slaves. Also, the alarming decline in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] population had spurred the first [[Laws of Burgos|royal laws protecting the native population]]. The first African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html |title=Health In Slavery |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003165601/http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html |archive-date=October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; England played a prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade. The "[[Triangular trade#Atlantic triangular slave trade|slave triangle]]" was pioneered by [[Francis Drake]] and his associates.

Many whites who arrived in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries came under contract as indentured servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Galenson |first1=David W. |title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis |journal=The Journal of Economic History |date=Mar 1984 |volume=XLIV |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |doi=10.1017/S002205070003134X |jstor=2120553 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2120553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in 1640 where a negro, [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], was sentenced to lifetime slavery, forcing him to serve his master, Hugh Gwyn, for the remainder of his life, for attempting to run away. This case was significant because it established the disparity between his sentence as a black man and that of the two white indentured servants who escaped with him (one described as Dutch and one as a Scotchman). It is the first documented case of a black man sentenced to lifetime servitude and is considered one of the first legal cases to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured servants.&lt;ref name="LLC"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bavis|first=Barbara|title=Research Guides: American Women: Resources from the Law Library: Introduction|url=https://guides.loc.gov/american-women-law/introduction|access-date=2021-02-11|website=guides.loc.gov|publisher=[[Law Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualjamestown.org/practise.html |title=Slave Laws |publisher=Virtual Jamestown |access-date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Out of the Land of Bondage": The English Revolution and the Atlantic Origins of Abolition |first=John |last=Donoghue |journal=The American Historical Review|volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=943–974 |year=2010 |doi=10.1086/ahr.115.4.943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period |first=A.

After 1640, planters started to ignore the expiration of indentured contracts and keep their servants as slaves for life. This was demonstrated by the 1655 case ''Johnson v.

=====Barbados=====
[[File:Bussa statue.png|thumb|upright|[[Bussa Emancipation Statue|Statue of Bussa]], who led the largest slave rebellion in Barbadian history.]]
In the early 17th century, the majority of the labour in Barbados was provided by European indentured servants, mainly [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]], with [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] and enslaved Amerindians providing little of the workforce. The introduction of [[sugar cane]] from [[Dutch Brazil]] in 1640 completely transformed society and the economy. Barbados eventually had one of the world's largest sugar industries.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{Cite book |author-link=Arif Ali |last1=Ali|first1=Arif |title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination |pages=46, 48 |year=1997 |publisher=Hansib Publishing (Caribbean) Ltd |isbn=978-1-870518-54-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the effects of the new crop increased, so did the shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and surrounding islands. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and enslaved Africans, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644, the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African descent, with the remainder mainly of English descent. These English smallholders were eventually bought out, and the island filled up with large sugar plantations worked by enslaved Africans. By 1660, there was near parity with 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites. By 1666, at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island. Many of the remaining whites were increasingly poor. By 1680, there were 17 slaves for every indentured servant. By 1700, there were 15,000 free whites and 50,000 enslaved Africans.

Because of the increased implementation of [[Barbados Slave Code|slave codes]], which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and ruling planter class, the island became increasingly unattractive to [[redlegs|poor whites]]. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of enslaved Africans to cultivate sugar cane.

=====Brazil=====
[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil 2.jpg|thumb|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil, by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]]]]
[[File:Jacques Etienne Arago - Castigo de Escravos, 1839.jpg|thumb|upright|''Slave punishment'' by [[Jacques Arago|Jacques Étienne Arago]], 1839.]]

[[Slavery in Brazil]] began long before the [[Colonial Brazil|first Portuguese settlement]] was established in 1532, as members of one tribe would enslave captured members of another.&lt;ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/pesquisa/PesquisaObraForm.jsp|title=Domínio Público - Pesquisa Básica|website=www.dominiopublico.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Portuguese colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labour during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions called ''{{lang|pt|bandeiras}}''. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries.

During the Atlantic slave trade era, Brazil imported more African slaves than any other country. Nearly 5&amp;nbsp;million slaves were brought from Africa to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informações disponíveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravidão no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|access-date=16 March 2015|language=pt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archive-date=March 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 1850s, most enslaved Africans who arrived on Brazilian shores were forced to embark at West Central African ports, especially in [[Luanda]] (present-day Angola). Today, with the exception of Nigeria, the largest population of people of African descent is in Brazil.&lt;ref name="cambriapress.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title=African Heritage and Memories of Slavery in Brazil and the South Atlantic World By Ana Lucia Araujo|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=618|access-date=2021-02-07|website=www.cambriapress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave labour was the driving force behind the growth of the [[Sugarcane|sugar]] economy in Brazil, and sugar was the primary export of the colony from 1600 to 1650. Gold and diamond deposits were discovered in Brazil in 1690, which sparked an increase in the importation of African slaves to power this newly profitable market. Transportation systems were developed for the mining infrastructure, and population boomed from immigrants seeking to take part in gold and diamond mining. Demand for African slaves did not wane after the decline of the mining industry in the second half of the 18th century. Cattle ranching and foodstuff production proliferated after the population growth, both of which relied heavily on slave labour. 1.7&amp;nbsp;million slaves were imported to Brazil from Africa from 1700 to 1800, and the rise of coffee in the 1830s further enticed expansion of the slave trade.

Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. Forty percent of the total number of slaves brought to the Americas were sent to Brazil. For reference, the United States received 10 percent. Despite being abolished, there are still people working in slavery-like conditions in Brazil in the 21st century.

=====Cuba=====
In 1789 the Spanish Crown led an effort to reform slavery, as the demand for slave labour in Cuba was growing. The Crown issued a decree, ''Código Negro Español'' (Spanish Black Codex), that specified food and clothing provisions, put limits on the number of [[work hours]], limited punishments, required religious instruction, and protected marriages, forbidding the sale of young children away from their mothers. The British made other changes to the institution of slavery in Cuba. But planters often flouted the laws and protested against them, considering them a threat to their authority and an intrusion into their personal lives.&lt;ref name=Childs&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Matt D.|title=1812 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery|year=2006|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-5772-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slaveowners did not protest against all the measures of the codex, many of which they argued were already common practices. They objected to efforts to set limits on their ability to apply physical punishment. For instance, the Black Codex limited [[Flagellation|whippings]] to 25 and required the whippings "not to cause serious bruises or bleeding". The slave-owners thought that the slaves would interpret these limits as weaknesses, ultimately leading to resistance. Another contested issue was the work hours that were restricted "from sunrise to sunset"; plantation owners responded by explaining that cutting and processing of cane needed 20-hour days during the harvest season.&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt;

Those slaves who worked on sugar plantations and in sugar mills were often subject to the harshest of conditions. The field work was rigorous manual labour which the slaves began at an early age. The work days lasted close to 20 hours during harvest and processing, including cultivating and cutting the crops, hauling wagons, and processing sugarcane with dangerous machinery. The slaves were forced to reside in [[barracoons]], where they were crammed in and locked in by a padlock at night, getting about three to four hours of sleep. The conditions of the barracoons were harsh; they were highly unsanitary and extremely hot. Typically there was no ventilation; the only window was a small barred hole in the wall.&lt;ref name="Montejo pp. 80-82"&gt;{{harvnb|Montejo|2016|pp=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Slaves Unloading Ice in Cuba 1832.jpg|thumb|Slaves in Cuba unloading ice from [[Maine]], 1832]]
Cuba's slavery system was gendered in a way that some duties were performed only by male slaves, some only by female slaves. Female slaves in [[Havana]] from the 16th century onwards performed duties such as operating the town taverns, eating houses, and lodges, as well as being laundresses and domestic labourers and servants. Female slaves also served as the town prostitutes.

Some Cuban women could gain freedom by having children with white men. As in other Latin cultures, there were looser borders with the [[mulatto]] or mixed-race population. Sometimes men who took slaves as wives or concubines freed both them and their children. As in New Orleans and Saint-Domingue, mulattos began to be classified as a third group between the European colonists and African slaves. [[Freedmen]], generally of mixed race, came to represent 20% of the total Cuban population and 41% of the non-white Cuban population.&lt;ref name="Knight pp. 144–145"&gt;Knight pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Planters encouraged Afro-Cuban slaves to have children in order to reproduce their work force. The masters wanted to pair strong and large-built black men with healthy black women. They were placed in the barracoons and forced to have sex and create offspring of “breed stock” children, who would sell for around 500 pesos. The planters needed children to be born to replace slaves who died under the harsh regime. Sometimes if the overseers did not like the quality of children, they separate the parents and sent the mother back to working in the fields.&lt;ref name="Montejo p. 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Montejo|2016|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both women and men were subject to the punishments of violence and humiliating abuse. Slaves who misbehaved or disobeyed their masters were often placed in stocks in the depths of the boiler houses where they were abandoned for days at a time, and oftentimes two to three months. These wooden stocks were made in two types: lying-down or stand-up types. women were punished, even when pregnant. They were subjected to whippings: they had to lie "face down over a scooped-out piece of round [earth] to protect their bellies."&lt;ref name="Montejo p. 40"&gt;{{harvnb|Montejo|2016|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some masters reportedly whipped pregnant women in the belly, often causing miscarriages. The wounds were treated with “compresses of tobacco leaves, urine and salt."&lt;ref name="Montejo pp. 39–40"&gt;{{harvnb|Montejo|2016|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Haiti=====

[[Slavery in Haiti]] started with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] on the island in 1492. The practice was devastating to the native population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Reséndez|first=Andrés|date=2016 |title=The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Z2gpCgAAQBAJ|page=17}}|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|page=17 |isbn=978-0547640983|author-link=Andrés Reséndez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the indigenous [[Taíno]]'s near decimation from forced labour, disease and war, the Spanish, under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolomeu de las Casas, and with the blessing of the Catholic church began engaging in earnest in the kidnapped and forced labour of enslaved Africans. During the [[French colonial empire|French colonial period]] beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as [[Saint-Domingue]]) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world.

Following the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, [[Hispaniola]] was divided between [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Imperial Spain|Spain]].  France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue.  To develop it into sugarcane plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from Africa. Sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of African slaves they had imported to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one.
[[File:Fire in Saint-Domingo 1791, German copper engraving.jpg|thumb|Saint-Domingue [[slave revolt]] in 1791]]

The French-enacted ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years.&lt;ref name="Farmer-LROB"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Farmer|first1=Paul | title=Who removed Aristide? | pages=28–31 |access-date= February 19, 2010 |date=April 15, 2004 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608222428/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html |archive-date=June 8, 2008 | newspaper=London Review of Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many slaves died from diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Kiple|first1= Kenneth F. | title = The Caribbean Slave: A Biological History | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=veMLoyrX0BEC}}| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | page = 145 | isbn = 978-0-521-52470-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had [[birth rate]]s around 3 percent, and there is evidence that some women [[abortion|aborted]] fetuses, or committed [[infanticide]], rather allow their children to live within the bonds of slavery.{{sfn|Campbell|2008|pp=27-53}}&lt;ref name=Moitt&gt;{{Cite book|last= Moitt|first=Bernard|title =Women and Slavery in the French Antilles, 1635–1848|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in its [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]], the [[New France|French colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]]: the [[mixed-race]] descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery. They established a separate social class. White French [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to France for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slave holders. The [[free people of color]] petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights.

Slaves that made it to Haiti from the trans-Atlantic journey and slaves born in Haiti were first documented in Haiti's archives and transferred to France's Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. {{As of|2015}}, these records are in The National Archives of France. According to the 1788 Census, Haiti's population consisted of nearly 40,000 whites, 30,000 free coloureds and 450,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Coupeau| first=Steeve|title=The History of Haiti|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tA-XfYZFNvkC|page=18}}|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|page=18| isbn=978-0-313-34089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1804, the only successful [[slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in human history, precipitated the end of slavery in all French colonies.

Although the African slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded 10,000, by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.

=====Mexico=====
In 1519, [[Hernán Cortés]] brought the first [[Afro-Mexican#African slavery in Mexico|modern slave]] to the area.&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite book|last=Agurilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|year=2006|publisher=California State University, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century, the second viceroy to Mexico, Luis de Velasco, prohibited slavery of the [[Aztecs]].  A labour shortage resulted as the Aztecs were either killed or died from disease.  This led to the African slaves being imported, as they were not susceptible to smallpox.  In exchange, many Africans were afforded the opportunity to buy their freedom, while eventually others were granted their freedom by their masters.&lt;ref name=World/&gt;

=====Puerto Rico=====
When [[Ponce de León]] and the Spaniards arrived on the island of [[Puerto Rico|Borikén]] (Puerto Rico), they enslaved Taíno tribes on the island, forcing them to work in the gold mines and in the construction of forts. Many Taíno died, particularly from smallpox, of which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Other Taínos committed suicide or left the island after the failed Taíno revolt of 1511.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yaz|first1=Designs |url=http://www.angelfire.com/az2/puertorico/Iagueybana.html|title='Puerto Rico' Grilla's Homepage|publisher=Angelfire.com|date=June 29, 2001|access-date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish colonists, fearing the loss of their labour force, complained the courts that they needed manpower. As an alternative, Las Casas suggested the importation and use of African slaves. In 1517, the Spanish Crown permitted its subjects to import twelve slaves each, thereby beginning the slave trade on the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021226015714/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html|archive-date=December 26, 2002|title=Bartoleme de las Casas|publisher=Oregonstate.edu|access-date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African slaves were legally branded with a hot iron on the forehead, prevented their "theft" or lawsuits that challenged their captivity.&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert A. |last=Martinez|url=http://www.ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm|title=African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality|publisher=ipoaa.com|access-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonists continued this branding practice for more than 250 years.&lt;ref name="Graces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XIXE/castelar/esclavitud/cedula.htm|title=Teoría, Crítica e Historia: La abolición de la esclavitud y el mundo hispano|publisher=Ensayistas.org|access-date=July 23, 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were sent to work in the gold mines, or in the island's ginger and sugar fields.  They were allowed to live with their families in a hut on the master's land, and given a patch of land where they could farm, but otherwise were subjected to harsh treatment; including sexual abuse as the majority of colonists had arrived without women; many of them intermarried with the Africans or Taínos. Their mixed-race descendants formed the first generations of the early Puerto Rican population.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;
[[File:Indemnity slave-bond.tif|thumb|upright|On March 22, 1873, Spain abolished slavery in Puerto Rico. The owners were compensated.]]
The slaves faced heavy discrimination and had no opportunity for advancement, though they were educated by their masters.  The Spaniards considered the Africans superior to the Taíno, since the latter were unwilling to assimilate. The slaves, in contrast, had little choice but to adapt. Many converted to Christianity and were given their masters' surnames.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;

By 1570, the colonists found that the gold mines were depleted, relegating the island to a garrison for passing ships. The cultivation of crops such as tobacco, cotton, cocoa, and ginger became the cornerstone of the economy.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{Cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=U3yO7M6gOeUC|page=5}} |title=Slave Revolts in Puerto Rico: Conspiracies and Uprisings, 1795-1873 |first=Guillermo A. |last=Baralt |date=2007 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With rising demand for sugar on the international market, major planters increased their labour-intensive cultivation and processing of sugar cane. Sugar plantations supplanted mining as Puerto Rico's main industry and kept demand high for African slavery.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

After 1784, Spain provided five ways by which slaves could obtain freedom.&lt;ref name="Graces"/&gt;  Five years later, the Spanish Crown issued the "Royal Decree of Graces of 1789", which set new rules related to the slave trade and added restrictions to the granting of freedman status. The decree granted its subjects the right to purchase slaves and to participate in the flourishing slave trade in the Caribbean. Later that year a new slave code, also known as ''El Código Negro'' (The Black Code), was introduced.&lt;ref name="Code"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/BandoNegro.htm|title=El 'Bando Negro' o "Código Negro"|trans-title=The "Black Edict" or "Black Code"|language=es|website=Government Gazette of Puerto Rico|issue=No. 67 – 3 June 1848|publisher=fortunecity.com|date=May 31, 1848|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606200620/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/BandoNegro.htm|archive-date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under "El Código Negro", a slave could buy his freedom, in the event that his master was willing to sell, by paying the price sought in installments. Slaves were allowed to earn money during their spare time by working as shoemakers, cleaning clothes, or selling the produce they grew on their own plots of land. For the freedom of their newborn child, not yet baptized, they paid at half the going price for a baptized child.&lt;ref name="Code"/&gt; Many of these freedmen started settlements in the areas which became known as Cangrejos ([[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]), [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], [[Loíza, Puerto Rico|Loíza]], and [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico|Luquillo]]. Some became slave owners themselves.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt; Despite these paths to freedom, from 1790 onwards, the number of slaves more than doubled in Puerto Rico as a result of the dramatic expansion of the sugar industry in the island.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

On March 22, 1873, slavery was legally abolished in Puerto Rico. However, slaves were not emancipated but rather had to buy their own freedom, at whatever price was set by their last masters. They were also required to work for another three years for their former masters, for other colonists interested in their services, or for the state in order to pay some compensation.&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web|first=José R. |last=Bas García|url=http://www.independencia.net/historia/jrb_abolicionEsclavitudPR23mar09.html|title=La abolición de la esclavitud de 1873 en Puerto Rico|trans-title=The abolition of slavery in 1873 in Puerto Rico|language=es|website=Center for Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean|publisher=independencia.net|date=March 23, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319000600/http://www.independencia.net/historia/jrb_abolicionEsclavitudPR23mar09.html|archive-date=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1527 and 1873, slaves in Puerto Rico had carried out more than twenty revolts.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007a|p=398}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Esclavitud/esclavitud.htm|title=Esclavitud Puerto Rico|publisher=Proyectosalonhogar.com|access-date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planters of the Dutch colony relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate, harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Planters' treatment of the slaves was notoriously bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Streissguth|first1=Tom |title=Suriname in Pictures|url=https://archive.org/details/surinameinpictur0000stre|url-access=registration |year= 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-1-57505-964-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/surinameinpictur0000stre/page/23 23]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[C.

Many slaves escaped the plantations.  With the help of the native South Americans living in the adjoining rain forests, these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right. They were known collectively in English as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], in French as ''Nèg'Marrons'' (literally meaning "brown negroes", that is "pale-skinned negroes"), and in Dutch as ''Marrons.''  The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of [[ethnogenesis]], as they were made up of slaves from different African ethnicities. These tribes include the [[Saramaka]],  Paramaka, [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] or Aukan, [[Kwinti]], [[Aluku]] or Boni, and Matawai.

The Maroons often raided plantations to recruit new members from the slaves and capture women, as well as to acquire weapons, food and supplies. They sometimes killed planters and their families in the raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=1777|title=Extract of the Dutch Map Representing the Colony of Surinam|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/524/|access-date=2021-02-07|website=www.wdl.org|last=Mentelle|first= Simon M.|publisher=Digital World Library via Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons, who generally escaped through the rain forest, which they knew much better than did the coloniss. To end hostilities, in the 18th century the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes. They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories, giving them autonomy.

In 1861–63, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] of the United States and his administration looked abroad for places to relocate freed slaves who wanted to leave the United States. It opened negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African-American emigration to and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname in South America. Nothing came of it and after 1864, the proposal was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Lincoln Administration's Negotiations to Colonize African Americans in Dutch Suriname|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/583987|access-date=2021-02-07|first=Michael J. |last=Douma|journal=Civil War History|volume=61|issue=2 |date=June 2015|pages=111–37|doi=10.1353/cwh.2015.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands abolished slavery in Suriname, in 1863, under a gradual process that required slaves to work on plantations for 10 transition years for minimal pay, which was considered as partial compensation for their masters. After 1873, most freedmen largely abandoned the plantations where they had worked for several generations in favor of the capital city, [[Paramaribo]].

=====United States=====
[[File:Slave Trader, Sold to Tennessee.jpg|thumb|A coffle of slaves being driven on foot from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], Virginia to Tennessee in 1850.]]
[[Slavery in the United States]] was the legal institution of human chattel enslavement, primarily of Africans and [[African Americans]], that existed in the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries, after it gained independence from the British and before the end of the [[American Civil War]]. Slavery had been practiced in [[British America]] from [[Slavery in the colonial history of the United States|early colonial days]] and was legal in all [[Thirteen Colonies]], at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. By the time of the [[American Revolution]], the status of slave had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Wood |first=Peter |year=2003 |title=The Birth of Race-Based Slavery |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/why_america_adopted_race_based_slavery.html |magazine=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States became polarized over the issue of slavery, represented by the [[slave and free states]] divided by the [[Mason–Dixon line]], which separated free Pennsylvania from slave Maryland and Delaware.

Congress, during the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] administration [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibited the importation of slaves]], effective 1808, although smuggling (illegal importing) was not unusual.&lt;ref name="Julia Floyd Smith 1973, pp. 44-46"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julia Floyd |last=Smith |title=Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860 |location=Gainesville |publisher=University of Florida Press |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-8130-0323-8 |pages=44–46 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BKIDcAAACAAJ|page=44}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic slave trading, however, continued at a rapid pace, driven by labour demands from the development of cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantations in the Deep South]]. Those states attempted to extend slavery into the new western territories to keep their share of political power in the nation. Such laws proposed to Congress to continue the spread of slavery into newly ratified states include the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act|Kansas-Nebraska Act]].

The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on conditions, times, and places. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, [[Lynching in the United States|hanging]], beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave.&lt;ref name=Wilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Wilbert Ellis|title=American Negro Slavery and Abolition: A Sociological Study|year=1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders.

[[William Wells Brown]], who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds of cotton per day, while women were required to pick 70 pounds per day; if any slave failed in their quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short.

More than one million slaves were sold from the [[Upper South]], which had a surplus of labour, and taken to the Deep South in a forced migration, splitting up many families.  New communities of African-American culture were developed in the Deep South, and the total slave population in the South eventually reached 4&amp;nbsp;million before liberation.&lt;ref name="Stephen1999"&gt;{{cite book |last= Behrendt |first=Stephen|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |url=https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi }} Based on "records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |title= Social Aspects of the Civil War|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073725/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |archive-date=July 14, 2007 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a "necessary evil". White people of that time feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery.  The French writer and traveler [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing its effects on American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against black people increased as they were granted more rights.  Others, like [[James Henry Hammond]] argued that slavery was a "positive good" stating: "Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement."

The Southern state governments wanted to keep a balance between the number of slave and free states to maintain a political balance of power in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The new [[Territories of the United States|territories]] acquired from [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French colonial empire|France]], and Mexico were the subject of major political compromises. By 1850, the newly rich cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and tensions continued to rise.  Many white Southern Christians, including church ministers, attempted to justify their support for slavery as modified by Christian paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-33/why-christians-supported-slavery.html#storystream|title=Why Did So Many Christians Support Slavery?|website=christianitytoday.com|access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest denominations, the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South.

When [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, according to the [[1860 United States Census|1860 U.S. census]], roughly 400,000 individuals, representing 8% of all U.S. families, owned nearly 4,000,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html |title=1860 Census Results |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604075834/http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html |archive-date=June 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of Southern families owned slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/08/small-truth-papering-over-a-big-lie/61136/|title=Small Truth Papering Over a Big Lie |magazine=The Atlantic |date=August 9, 2010 |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The South was heavily invested in slavery.  As such, upon Lincoln's election, seven states broke away to form the [[Confederate States of America]]. The first six states to secede held the greatest number of slaves in the South. Shortly after, over the issue of slavery, the United States erupted into an all out [[American Civil War|Civil War]], with slavery legally ceasing as an institution following the war in December 1865.

In 2018, the ''Orlando Sentinel'' reported some private Christian schools in Florida as teaching students a [[Creationism|creationist]] curriculum which includes assertions such as, “most black and white southerners had long lived together in harmony” and that “power-hungry individuals stirred up the people” leading to the [[Civil rights movement (1865–1896)|Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-voucher-school-curriculum-20180503-story.html |title=Schools Without Rules: Private schools' curriculum downplays slavery, says humans and dinosaurs lived together |last=Postal |first=Leslie |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=June 1, 2018 |access-date=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century [[Qing Dynasty]], there was a hereditarily servile people called ''Booi Aha'' (Manchu:booi niyalma; Chinese transliteration: 包衣阿哈), which is a Manchu word literally translated as "household person" and sometimes rendered as "[[nucai]]." The Manchu was establishing close personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhachi said, "The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Granet |first=Marcel |author-link1=Marcel Granet|title=Chinese Civilization

=====India=====
[[Slavery in India]] was widespread by the 6th century BC, and perhaps even as far back as the [[Vedic period]].&lt;ref&gt;footnote 2: (...) While it is likely that the institution of slavery existed in India during the Vedic period, the association of the Vedic 'Dasa' with 'slaves' is problematic and likely to have been a later development.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery intensified during the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim domination of northern India]] after the 11th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levi |first=Scott C. |date=November 2002 |title=Hindus Beyond the Hindu Kush: Indians in the Central Asian Slave Trade |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=277–288 |doi=10.1017/S1356186302000329 |jstor=25188289 |s2cid=155047611 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/3960723 |quote=Sources such as the Arthasastra, the Manusmriti and the Mahabharata demonstrate that institutionalized slavery was well established in India by beginning of the common era}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery existed in [[Portuguese India]] after the 16th century. The Dutch, too, largely dealt in Abyssian slaves, known in India as Habshis or Sheedes.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020720/windows/slice.htm | title=Windows – Slice of history|newspaper=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arakan/Bengal, Malabar, and [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel]] remained the largest sources of forced labour until the 1660s.

Between 1626 and 1662, the Dutch exported on an average 150–400 slaves annually from the Arakan-Bengal coast. During the first 30 years of Batavia's existence, Indian and Arakanese slaves provided the main labour force of the Dutch East India Company, Asian headquarters. An increase in Coromandel slaves occurred during a famine following the revolt of the Nayaka Indian rulers of South India (Tanjavur, Senji, and Madurai) against Bijapur overlordship (1645) and the subsequent devastation of the Tanjavur countryside by the Bijapur army. Reportedly, more than 150,000 people were taken by the invading Deccani Muslim armies to Bijapur and Golconda. In 1646, 2,118 slaves were exported to Batavia, the overwhelming majority from southern Coromandel. Some slaves were also acquired further south at Tondi, Adirampatnam, and Kayalpatnam. Another increase in slaving took place between 1659 and 1661 from Tanjavur as a result of a series of successive Bijapuri raids. At Nagapatnam, Pulicat, and elsewhere, the company purchased 8,000–10,000 slaves, the bulk of whom were sent to Ceylon, while a small portion were exported to Batavia and Malacca. Finally, following a long drought in Madurai and southern Coromandel, in 1673, which intensified the prolonged Madurai-Maratha struggle over Tanjavur and punitive fiscal practices, thousands of people from Tanjavur, mostly children, were sold into slavery and exported by Asian traders from Nagapattinam to Aceh, Johor, and other slave markets.

In September 1687, 665 slaves were exported by the English from Fort St. George, Madras.  And, in 1694–96, when warfare once more ravaged South India, a total of 3,859 slaves were imported from Coromandel by private individuals into Ceylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Subrahmanyam|first=Sanjay|date=1997|title=Slaves and Tyrants: Dutch Tribulations in Seventeenth-Century Mrauk-U|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/157006597x00028|journal=[[Journal of Early Modern History]]|volume=1|issue=3|pages=201–253|doi=10.1163/157006597x00028|issn=1385-3783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Prakash|first=Om|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hciTRYbE27gC}}|title=European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India|date=1998-06-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|work=[[The New Cambridge History of India]]|isbn=978-0-521-25758-9|volume=II|page=5 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Prakash|first=Om|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400857760|title=The Dutch East India Company and the Economy of Bengal, 1630-1720|date=1985-01-01|publisher=Princeton University Press|doi=10.1515/9781400857760|isbn=978-1-4008-5776-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Richards|first=John F.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4evztAEACAAJ}}|title=The Mughal Empire|date=2012|location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-58406-0 |series=The New Cambridge History of India, Part I, Volume 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raychaudhuri and Habib, eds, ''The Cambridge Economic History of India I''; V.B.

On 19 voyages between 1677 and 1732, the mortality rate was somewhat lower (22.7%). See Shell, "Slavery at the Cape of Good Hope, 1680–1731," p. 332. Filliot estimated the average mortality rate among slaves shipped from India and West Africa to the Mascarene Islands at 20–25% and 25–30%, respectively. Average mortality rates among slaves arriving from closer catchment areas were lower: 12% from Madagascar and 21% from Southeast Africa. See Filliot, La Traite des Esclaves, p. 228; A.

According to Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there were an estimated 8 or 9&amp;nbsp;million slaves in India in 1841. About 15% of the population of [[Malabar District|Malabar]] were slaves.

[[File:Belomorkanal3.jpg|thumb|Workers being forced to haul rocks up a hill in a Gulag]]

Between 1930 and 1960, the [[Soviet Union]] created a system of, according to [[Anne Applebaum]] and the "perspective of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]", slave labor camps called the ''Gulag'' ({{lang-ru|ГУЛаг|GULag}}).&lt;ref&gt;For sources about forced slave labor in GULAG camps, see {{cite book |last=Applebaum |first=Anne |title=Gulag: A History |date= |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing |location=New York |chapter=Introduction |page=xv |quote=Gulag is the word an acronym for ''Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei'' or Central Administration of Camps.

Prisoners in these camps were worked to death by a combination of extreme production quotas, physical and psychological brutality, hunger, lack of medical care, and the harsh environment. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], who survived eight years of Gulag incarceration, provided first hand testimony about the camps with the publication of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hoover Press| last1 = Gregory| first1 = Paul R.| last2 = Lazarev| first2 = Valery| title = The Economics of Forced Labor: The Soviet Gulag| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2003 |page=vii |quote=Much has been written, and much is still to be written, about the Gulag.

Golfo Alexopoulos draws a comparison equating labor in the Gulag and ''"other forms of slave labor"'' and the ''"violence of human exploitation"'' Gulag slavery entailed in ''Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag'',&lt;ref name=":1Illness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag |first1=Golfo |last1=Alexopoulos |url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300179415/illness-and-inhumanity-stalins-gulag |publisher=Yale University/The Hoover Institution |location=New Haven, CT |date=2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stalin's Gulag was, in many ways, less a concentration camp than a forced labor camp and less a prison system than a system of slavery. The image of the slave appears often in Gulag memoir literature. As Varlam Shalamov wrote: ''"Hungry and exhausted, we leaned into a horse collar, raising blood blisters on our chests and pulling a stone-filled cart up the slanted mine floor. The collar was the same device used long ago by the ancient Egyptians."'' Thoughtful and rigorous historical comparisons of Soviet forced labor and '''other forms of slave labor''' would be worthy of scholarly attention, in my view. For as in the case of global slavery, the Gulag found legitimacy in an elaborate narrative of difference that involved the presumption of dangerousness and guilt. This ideology of difference and the violence of human exploitation have left lasting legacies in contemporary Russia.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Anne Applebaum]] writes in the introduction of her book that the word ''GULAG'' has come to represent ''"the system of Soviet slave labor itself, in all its forms and varieties"'':&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Anchor| last = Applebaum| first = Anne| title = Gulag: A History| chapter=Introduction |date = 2007 | url = http://victimsofcommunism.org/gulag-an-introduction/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170905220152/http://victimsofcommunism.org/gulag-an-introduction/| archive-date = September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word ''"GULAG"'' is an acronym for ''Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei'', or Main Camp Administration, the institution which ran the Soviet camps. But over time, the word has also come to signify the system of Soviet slave labor itself, in all its forms and varieties: labor camps, punishment camps, criminal and political camps, women's camps, children's camps, transit camps. Even more broadly, “Gulag” has come to mean the Soviet repressive system itself, the set of procedures that Alexander Solzhenitsyn once called “our meat grinder”: the arrests, the interrogations, the transport in unheated cattle cars, the forced labor, the destruction of families, the years spent in exile, the early and unnecessary deaths.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Applebaum's introduction has been criticized by Gulag researcher Wilson Bell,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wilson Bell|url=https://tru.academia.edu/WilsonBell|website=[[Academia.edu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that her book "is, ''aside from the introduction'', a well-done overview of the Gulag, but it did not offer an interpretative framework much beyond [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]]'s paradigms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=14 November 2017|title=New directions in Gulag studies: a roundtable discussion|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00085006.2017.1384665|journal=[[Tandford Online]]|page=2|doi=10.1080/00085006.2017.1384665|last1=Barenberg|first1=Alan|last2=Bell|first2=Wilson T.|last3=Kinnear|first3=Sean|last4=Maddox|first4=Steven|last5=Viola|first5=Lynne|volume=59|issue=3–4|s2cid=165354205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Nazi Germany effectively enslaved about 12 million people]], both those considered undesirable and citizens of conquered countries, with the avowed intention of treating these ''[[Untermenschen]]'' (sub-humans) as a permanent slave-class of inferior beings who could be worked until they died, and who possessed neither the rights nor the legal status of members of the [[Aryan race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2001-05-30|title=Nazi slave fund passes final hurdle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1360426.stm|access-date=2021-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Jews, the harshest deportation and forced labour policies were applied to the populations of Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. By the end of the war, half of Belarus' population had been killed or deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267884530|title=Kleine Ostarbeiter: Child Forced Labor in Nazi Germany and German Occupied Eastern Europe|first1=Johannes-Dieter |last1=Steinert|conference=127th Annual Meeting American Historical Association|quote=...apart from Jewish forced labourers – workers from Belarus, Ukraine and Russia had to endure the worst working and living conditions.

====China====

The Chinese government has a history of imprisoning citizens for political reasons. Article 73 of China's [[Criminal procedure|Criminal Procedure]] Law was adopted in 2012 and allow the authorities to detain people for reasons of "state security" or "[[terrorism]]". In this regard, detainees can be held for as long as six months in "designated locations" such as secret prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/in-china-the-brutality-of-house-arrest.html|title=In China, the Brutality of 'House Arrest' (Published 2017)|first=Steven Lee|last=Myers|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of [[human trafficking]] are typically recruited through deceit or trickery (such as a false job offer, false migration offer, or false marriage offer), sale by family members, recruitment by former slaves, or outright abduction. Victims are forced into a "debt slavery" situation by coercion, deception, fraud, intimidation, isolation, threat, physical force, debt bondage or even [[force-feeding]] with drugs to control their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/violence-against-women/end-human-trafficking/trafficking-faq/page.do?id=1108432&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=738 |title=Trafficking FAQs – Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnesty International |date=March 30, 2007 |access-date=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708085725/http://www.amnestyusa.org/violence-against-women/end-human-trafficking/trafficking-faq/page.do?id=1108432&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=738 |archive-date=July 8, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Annually, according to U.S. government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries.

A prominent critic of [[slavery in the Spanish New World colonies]] was the Spanish missionary and bishop, [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who was "the first to expose the oppression of indigenous peoples by Europeans in the Americas and to call for the abolition of slavery there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Dussel |first=Enrique |author-link=Enrique Dussel |title=Bartolomé de Las Casas |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |date=4 January 2021|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bartolome-de-Las-Casas|access-date=13 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first protests against slavery came from German and Dutch [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in Pennsylvania in 1688.&lt;ref name="jrank" /&gt; In 1777, Vermont, [[Vermont Republic|at the time an independent nation]], [[History of slavery in Vermont|became the first]] portion of what would become the United States to abolish slavery.&lt;ref name="jrank" /&gt;

In the United States, all of the northern states had abolished slavery by 1804, with New Jersey being the last to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Howard L.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=plHxL2XIKloC|page=84}}|title=Words that Make New Jersey History: A Primary Source Reader|date=1995|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2113-8|page=84|quote=1804:  With passage of the law excerpted here, New Jersey became the last state in the North to abolish slavery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist pressure produced a series of small steps towards emancipation. After the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] went into effect on January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Foner|first=Eric|date=2007-12-30|title=Opinion {{!}} Forgotten Step Toward Freedom (Published 2007)|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/opinion/30foner.html|access-date=2021-02-06|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|internal slave trade]], nor involvement in the international slave trade externally. Legal slavery persisted outside the northern states; most of those slaves already in the U.S. were [[Emancipation Proclamation|legally emancipated]] only in 1863. Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the [[Underground Railroad]]. Violent clashes between anti-slavery and pro-slavery Americans included [[Bleeding Kansas]], a series of political and armed disputes in 1854–1861 as to whether Kansas would join the United States as a [[Slave and free states|slave or free state]]. By 1860, the total number of slaves reached almost four million, and the [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of slavery in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073725/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm|archive-date=July 14, 2007 |title=Soldiers and Sailors Database – The Civil War (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Itd.nps.gov |date=September 19, 2015 |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which freed slaves held in the Confederate States; the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.&amp;nbsp;S. Constitution]] prohibited most forms of slavery throughout the country.

Many of the freed slaves became sharecroppers and indentured servants. In this manner, some became tied to the very parcel of land into which they had been born a slave having little freedom or economic opportunity because of [[Jim Crow laws]] which perpetuated discrimination, limited education, promoted persecution without due process and resulted in continued poverty. Fear of reprisals such as unjust incarcerations and lynchings deterred upward mobility further.

France abolished slavery in 1794.&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5913/Abolition-Movement.html |title=Abolition Movement |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723064315/http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5913/Abolition-Movement.html |archive-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most significant milestones in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world occurred in England in 1772, with British Judge [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], whose opinion in [[Somersett's Case]] was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in England. This judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions could not be enforced in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wise|first=Steven M.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=A76TPwAACAAJ}}|title=Though the Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial that Led to the End of Human Slavery|date=2006|publisher=Pimlico|isbn=978-1-84413-430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sons of Africa]] was a late 18th-century British group that campaigned to end slavery. Its members were Africans in London, freed slaves who included [[Ottobah Cugoano]], [[Olaudah Equiano]] and other leading members of London's black community. It was closely connected to the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], a non-denominational group founded in 1787, whose members included [[Thomas Clarkson]]. British Member of Parliament [[William Wilberforce]] led the anti-slavery movement in the United Kingdom, although the groundwork was an anti-slavery essay by Clarkson. Wilberforce was urged by his close friend, Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], to make the issue his own and was also given support by reformed Evangelical [[John Newton]]. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] was passed by the British Parliament on March 25, 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the [[British Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalnavy.mod.uk/history/battles/royal-navy-and-the-slave-trade/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090128205546/royalnavy.mod.uk/history/battles/royal-navy-and-the-slave-trade/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 28, 2009 |title=Royal Navy and the Slave Trade : Battles : History : Royal Navy |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the British Empire, which he lived to see in the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].

After the 1807 act abolishing the slave trade was passed, these campaigners switched to [[Blockade of Africa|encouraging other countries]] to follow suit, notably France and the British colonies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml |title=Devon – Abolition – Sailing against slavery |publisher=BBC |date=February 28, 2007 |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of Lagos", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS |title=The West African Squadron and slave trade |publisher=Pdavis.nl |access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldwide===
In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, [[Anti-Slavery International]], was formed in Britain by [[Joseph Sturge]], which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Anti-Slavery International: UNESCO Education |publisher=UNESCO |date=November 13, 2002 |access-date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were celebrations in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom through the work of the British [[Anti-Slavery International|Anti-Slavery Society]].

In the 1860s, [[David Livingstone]]'s reports of atrocities within the Arab slave trade in Africa stirred up the interest of the British public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. The Royal Navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress "this abominable Eastern trade", at [[Zanzibar]] in particular. In 1905, the French abolished indigenous slavery in most of [[French West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/colloqpapers/16peterson.pdf |title=Home Page &amp;#124; Agrarian Studies |publisher=Yale.edu |access-date=September 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502161407/http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/colloqpapers/16peterson.pdf |archive-date=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized [[human rights|human right]]. Article 4 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:
{{quote|No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/law.shtml|title=The law against slavery|work=BBC News|access-date=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2014, for the first time in history, major leaders of many religions, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim&lt;!--alphabetical--&gt; met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by 2020.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news  |last1=Belardelli |first1=Giulia |date=2 December 2014 |title=Pope Francis And Other Religious Leaders Sign Declaration Against Modern Slavery |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/pope-francis-and-other-re_n_6256640 |newspaper=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories were: [[Pope Francis]], [[Mata Amritanandamayi|Mātā Amṛtānandamayī]], Bhikkhuni Thich Nu [[Chân Không]] (representing Zen Master [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]), Datuk K Sri Dhammaratana, Chief High Priest of Malaysia, Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]], Rabbi David Rosen, Abbas Abdalla Abbas Soliman, Undersecretary of State of Al Azhar Alsharif (representing Mohamed Ahmed El-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi, Sheikh Naziyah Razzaq Jaafar, Special advisor of Grand Ayatollah (representing Grand Ayatollah Sheikh Basheer Hussain al Najafi), Sheikh Omar Abboud, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Metropolitan Emmanuel of France (representing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.)&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

Groups such as the [[American Anti-Slavery Group]], [[Anti-Slavery International]], [[Free the Slaves]], the Anti-Slavery Society, and the Norwegian Anti-Slavery Society continue to campaign to eliminate slavery.

On May 21, 2001, the [[National Assembly of France]] passed the [[Christiane Taubira|Taubira]] law, recognizing slavery as a [[crime against humanity]]. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] was performed with a high degree of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Boahen |first1=A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is adequate evidence citing case after case of African control of segments of the trade. Several African nations such as the Calabar and other southern parts of Nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade. African peoples such as the Imbangala of Angola and the Nyamwezi of Tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other African nations to capture Africans for Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrikan_involvement.htm |title=Afrikan Involvement In Atlantic Slave Trade, By Kwaku Person-Lynn, Ph.

Several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the Atlantic slave trade. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ball |first=Jeremy R.|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=8469 |work=H-Net Reviews |date=November 2003 |access-date=2021-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050122054905/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=13661080113274 |archive-date=2005-01-22 |title=Alcohol and Slaves |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of an apology is linked to [[reparations for slavery]] and is still being pursued by entities across the world. For example, the Jamaican Reparations Movement approved its declaration and action plan. In 2007, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] made a formal apology for Great Britain's involvement in slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2007-03-14|title=Blair 'sorry' for UK slavery role|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6451793.stm|access-date=2021-02-06|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2007, the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] resolved to 'profoundly regret' and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery. Unique and the first of its kind in the U.S., the apology was unanimously passed in both Houses as Virginia approached the 400th anniversary of the founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6394981.stm |title=Virginia 'sorry' for slavery role |work=BBC News |date=February 25, 2007 |access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2007, Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] of London apologized publicly for Britain's role in colonial slave trade. "You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery," he said, pointing towards the financial district. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. Specifically, London outfitted, financed, and insured many of the ships, which helped fund the building of London's docks.&lt;ref name="jump"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/aug/24/london.humanrights  |title=Livingstone weeps as he apologises for slavery |work=The Guardian |date=August 24, 2007 |access-date=January 7, 2020 |location=London |first=Hugh |last=Muir |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107154804/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/aug/24/london.humanrights |archive-date=January 7, 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in [[Liverpool]], which was a large slave trading port, apologized in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2007/02/15/abolition_liverpool_apology_feature.shtml |title=Liverpool's slavery apology |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=September 24, 2014 |first=Paul |last=Coslett |access-date=January 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] apologized for Arab involvement in the slave trade, saying: "I regret the behavior of the Arabs… They brought African children to North Africa, they made them slaves, they sold them like animals, and they took them as slaves and traded them in a shameful way."{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Reparations===
{{Main|Reparations for slavery}}
There have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves or for their descendants. Claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a [[Private law|civil law]] matter in almost every country. This is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves' relatives lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile [[Service of process|legal process]]. Mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines, paid by unspecified parties, and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this "civil court problem." Since in almost all cases there are no living ex-slaves or living ex-slave owners these movements have gained little traction. In nearly all cases the judicial system has ruled that the [[statute of limitations]] on these possible claims has long since expired.
