The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Birbrair A, Zhang T, Wang ZM, Messi ML, Olson JD, Mintz A, Delbono O | title = Type-2 pericytes participate in normal and tumoral angiogenesis | journal = Am.

[[ICD-10]] classifies neoplasms into four main groups: [[Benign tumor|benign neoplasms]], [[in situ neoplasms]], [[malignant neoplasms]], and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=II Neoplasms|work =International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Version for 2010|url=https://icd.who.int/browse10/2010/en#/II|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as [[cancer]]s and are the focus of [[oncology]].

Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue, as neoplasia, [[Cell (biology)|cells]] often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as [[metaplasia]] or [[dysplasia]].&lt;ref name = "Abrams"&gt;{{cite web |last=Abrams |first=Gerald |title=Neoplasia I |url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/m1/patientspop-genetics/fall2008/materials |access-date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia and can occur in other conditions as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The word is from [[Ancient Greek]] νέος- ''neo'' 'new' and πλάσμα ''plasma'' 'formation, creation'.

==Types==
{{-plasia}}
A neoplasm can be [[benign tumor|benign]], potentially malignant, or malignant ([[cancer]]).&lt;ref name="titleCancer - Activity 1 - Glossary, page 4 of 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/cancer/other/glossary/act1-gloss4.htm |title=Cancer - Activity 1 - Glossary, page 4 of 5 |access-date=2008-01-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064024/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/cancer/other/glossary/act1-gloss4.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benign tumor]]s include [[uterine fibroids]], [[osteophytes]] and [[melanocytic nevus|melanocytic nevi]] (skin moles). They are circumscribed and localized and do not transform into cancer.&lt;ref name = "Abrams" /&gt;
* Potentially-malignant neoplasms include [[carcinoma in situ]]. They are localised, do not invade and destroy but in time, may transform into a cancer.
* Malignant neoplasms are commonly called cancer. They invade and destroy the surrounding tissue, may form [[metastasis|metastases]] and, if untreated or unresponsive to treatment, will generally prove fatal.
* Secondary neoplasm refers to any of a class of cancerous tumor that is either a metastatic offshoot of a primary tumor, or an apparently unrelated tumor that increases in frequency following certain cancer treatments such as  [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]].
* Rarely there can be a metastatic neoplasm with no known site of the primary cancer and this is classed as a [[cancer of unknown primary origin]].

===Clonality===
Neoplastic tumors are often [[Tumour heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] and contain more than one type of cell, but their initiation and continued growth is usually dependent on a single population of neoplastic cells. These cells are presumed to be [[clone (cell biology)|clonal]] – that is, they are derived from the same cell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2754 Clone definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and all carry the same [[mutation|genetic]] or [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] anomaly – evident of clonality. For lymphoid neoplasms, e.g. [[lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]], clonality is proven by the amplification of a single rearrangement of their [[immunoglobulin]] gene (for [[B cell]] lesions) or [[T cell receptor]] gene (for [[T cell]] lesions). The demonstration of clonality is now considered to be necessary to identify a lymphoid cell proliferation as neoplastic.&lt;ref name="pmid7990861"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee ES, Locker J, Nalesnik M, Reyes J, Jaffe R, Alashari M, Nour B, Tzakis A, Dickman PS | title = The association of Epstein-Barr virus with smooth-muscle tumors occurring after organ transplantation | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 332 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–25 |date=January 1995 | pmid = 7990861 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199501053320104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is tempting to define neoplasms as clonal cellular proliferations but the demonstration of clonality is not always possible. Therefore, clonality is not required in the definition of neoplasia.

===Neoplasm vs. tumor===
The word ''tumor'' or ''tumour'' comes from the Latin word for ''swelling'', which is one of the cardinal signs of inflammation. The word originally referred to any form of [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], neoplastic or not. In modern English, ''tumor'' is used as a synonym for neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic [[lesion]] that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size.&lt;ref name="titlePancreas Cancer: Glossary of Terms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/slides/glossary.html |title=Pancreas Cancer: Glossary of Terms |access-date=2008-01-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |title=Tumor |edition=31st|year=2007 |publisher=[[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] |isbn=978-1-84972-348-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some neoplasms do not form a tumor - these include [[leukemia]] and most forms of [[carcinoma in situ]]. ''Tumor'' is also not synonymous with ''[[cancer]].'' While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be [[Benign tumor|benign]], [[precancerous condition|precancerous]], or [[Malignancy|malignant]].

The terms ''mass'' and ''nodule'' are often used synonymously with ''tumor''. Generally speaking, however, the term ''tumor'' is used generically, without reference to the physical size of the lesion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; More specifically, the term ''mass'' is often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters (mm) in greatest direction, while the term ''[[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]'' is usually used when the size of the lesion is less than 20&amp;nbsp;mm in its greatest dimension (25.4&amp;nbsp;mm = 1&amp;nbsp;inch).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Causes ==

[[Image:Fibroids.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating benign neoplasms, namely [[uterine fibroids|fibroids]] of the [[uterus]]]]
Tumors in humans occur as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations within single cells, which cause the cell to divide and expand uncontrollably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-030419-033413|doi-access=free|title=Investigating Tumor Heterogeneity in Mouse Models|year=2020|last1=Tammela|first1=Tuomas|last2=Sage|first2=Julien|journal=Annual Review of Cancer Biology|volume=4|pages=99–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neoplasm can be caused by an abnormal proliferation of tissues, which can be caused by genetic [[mutation]]s. Not all types of neoplasms cause a tumorous overgrowth of tissue, however (such as [[leukemia]] or [[carcinoma in situ]]) and similarities between neoplasmic growths and regenerative processes, e.g., dedifferentiation and rapid cell proliferation, have been pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asashima M, Oinuma T, Meyer-Rochow VB|title=Tumors in amphibia|journal=Zoological Science|date=1987|volume=4|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumor growth has been studied using mathematics and [[continuum mechanics]]. Vascular tumors such as [[hemangioma]]s and [[lymphangioma]]s (formed from blood or lymph vessels) are thus looked at as being amalgams of a solid skeleton formed by sticky cells and an organic liquid filling the spaces in which cells can grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ambrosi D, Mollica F |title=On the mechanics of a growing tumor | year = 2002 | journal = International Journal of Engineering Science | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 1297–316 | doi = 10.1016/S0020-7225(02)00014-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this type of model, mechanical stresses and strains can be dealt with and their influence on the growth of the tumor and the surrounding tissue and vasculature elucidated. Recent findings from experiments that use this model show that active growth of the tumor is restricted to the outer edges of the tumor and that stiffening of the underlying normal tissue inhibits tumor growth as well.&lt;ref name="pmid16793355"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Volokh KY | title = Stresses in growing soft tissues | journal = Acta Biomater | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 493–504 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16793355 | doi = 10.1016/j.actbio.2006.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benign conditions that are ''not'' associated with an abnormal proliferation of tissue (such as [[sebaceous cyst]]s) can also present as tumors, however, but have no malignant potential. [[Breast cyst]]s (as occur commonly during pregnancy and at other times) are another example, as are other encapsulated glandular swellings (thyroid, adrenal gland, pancreas).

Encapsulated hematomas, encapsulated necrotic tissue (from an insect bite, foreign body, or other noxious mechanism), [[keloid]]s (discrete overgrowths of scar tissue) and [[granuloma]]s may also present as tumors.

Discrete localized enlargements of normal structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or [[Enteric duplication cyst|gastrointestinal duplications]]) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It can be dangerous to [[biopsy]] a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision in an attempt to avoid such severe complications.

===DNA damage===
[[File:Diagram Damage to Cancer Wiki 300dpi.svg|thumb|The central role of DNA damage and epigenetic defects in [[DNA repair]] genes in malignant neoplasms]]
[[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] is considered to be the primary underlying cause of malignant neoplasms known as cancers.&lt;ref name="pmid18403632"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kastan MB |title=DNA damage responses: mechanisms and roles in human disease: 2007 G.H.A.

(The central features of DNA damage, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.)  DNA damage is very common.  Naturally occurring DNA damages (mostly due to cellular metabolism and the properties of DNA in water at body temperatures) occur at a rate of more than 60,000 new damages, on average, per human cell, per day{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} [also see article [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]] ]. Additional DNA damages can arise from exposure to [[Exogeny|exogenous]] agents.

Individuals with a germ line mutation causing deficiency in any of 34 [[DNA repair]] genes (see article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]) are at increased risk of [[cancer]]. Some germ line mutations in DNA repair genes cause up to 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g., [[p53]] mutations).&lt;ref name="pmid21779515"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Malkin D | title = Li-fraumeni syndrome | journal = Genes Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 475–84 |date=April 2011 | pmid = 21779515 | pmc = 3135649 | doi = 10.1177/1947601911413466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These germ line mutations are indicated in a box at the left of the figure with an arrow indicating their contribution to DNA repair deficiency.

About 70% of malignant neoplasms have no hereditary component and are called "sporadic cancers".&lt;ref name="pmid10891514"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lichtenstein P, Holm NV, Verkasalo PK, Iliadou A, Kaprio J, Koskenvuo M, Pukkala E, Skytthe A, Hemminki K | title = Environmental and heritable factors in the causation of cancer--analyses of cohorts of twins from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland | journal = N.

For example, of 113 sequential colorectal cancers, only four had a [[missense mutation]] in the DNA repair gene [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]], while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration).&lt;ref name="pmid15888787"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halford S, Rowan A, Sawyer E, Talbot I, Tomlinson I | title = O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase in colorectal cancers: detection of mutations, loss of expression, and weak association with G:C&gt;A:T transitions | journal = Gut | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 797–802 |date=June 2005 | pmid = 15888787 | pmc = 1774551 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2004.059535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five reports present evidence that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.&lt;ref name="pmid16174854"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shen L, Kondo Y, Rosner GL, Xiao L, Hernandez NS, Vilaythong J, Houlihan PS, Krouse RS, Prasad AR, Einspahr JG, Buckmeier J, Alberts DS, Hamilton SR, Issa JP | title = MGMT promoter methylation and field defect in sporadic colorectal cancer | journal = J.

Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1).&lt;ref name="pmid15887099"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Truninger K, Menigatti M, Luz J, Russell A, Haider R, Gebbers JO, Bannwart F, Yurtsever H, Neuweiler J, Riehle HM, Cattaruzza MS, Heinimann K, Schär P, Jiricny J, Marra G |display-authors = 6| title = Immunohistochemical analysis reveals high frequency of PMS2 defects in colorectal cancer | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 5 | pages = 1160–71 |date=May 2005 | pmid = 15887099 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.01.056 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.&lt;ref name="pmid20351277"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valeri N, Gasparini P, Fabbri M, Braconi C, Veronese A, Lovat F, Adair B, Vannini I, Fanini F, Bottoni A, Costinean S, Sandhu SK, Nuovo GJ, Alder H, Gafa R, Calore F, Ferracin M, Lanza G, Volinia S, Negrini M, McIlhatton MA, Amadori D, Fishel R, Croce CM |display-authors = 6| title = Modulation of mismatch repair and genomic stability by miR-155 | journal = Proc.

Field defects, normal appearing tissue with multiple alterations (and discussed in the section below), are common precursors to development of the disordered and improperly proliferating clone of tissue in a malignant neoplasm. Such field defects (second level from bottom of figure) may have multiple mutations and epigenetic alterations.

Once a cancer is formed, it usually has [[genome instability]]. This instability is likely due to reduced DNA repair or excessive DNA damage. Because of such instability, the cancer continues to evolve and to produce sub clones. For example, a renal cancer, sampled in 9 areas, had 40 ubiquitous mutations, demonstrating [[tumour heterogeneity|tumor heterogeneity]] (i.e. present in all areas of the cancer), 59 mutations shared by some (but not all areas), and 29 “private” mutations only present in one of the areas of the cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid22397650"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerlinger M, Rowan AJ, Horswell S, Larkin J, Endesfelder D, Gronroos E, Martinez P, Matthews N, Stewart A, Tarpey P, Varela I, Phillimore B, Begum S, McDonald NQ, Butler A, Jones D, Raine K, Latimer C, Santos CR, Nohadani M, Eklund AC, Spencer-Dene B, Clark G, Pickering L, Stamp G, Gore M, Szallasi Z, Downward J, Futreal PA, Swanton C |display-authors = 6| title = Intratumor heterogeneity and branched evolution revealed by multiregion sequencing | journal = N.

Various other terms have been used to describe this [[phenomenon]], including "field effect", "field cancerization", and "field [[carcinogenesis]]". The term "field cancerization" was first used in 1953 to describe an area or "field" of epithelium that has been preconditioned by (at that time) largely unknown processes so as to predispose it towards development of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid13094644"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Slaughter DP, Southwick HW, Smejkal W | title = Field cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium; clinical implications of multicentric origin | journal = Cancer | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 963–8 |date=September 1953 | pmid = 13094644 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(195309)6:5&lt;963::AID-CNCR2820060515&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the terms "field cancerization" and "field defect" have been used to describe pre-malignant tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.

Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.

An expanded view of field effect has been termed "etiologic field effect", which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local [[microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]] on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to patient death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Fuchs CS, Beck AH, Giovannucci E, Ogino S | year = 2014 | title = Etiologic field effect: reappraisal of the field effect concept in cancer predisposition and progression | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = 14–29| doi = 10.1038/modpathol.2014.81 | pmid=24925058 | pmc=4265316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colon, a field defect probably arises by natural selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells at the base of one of the [[Intestinal gland|intestinal crypts]] on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells by natural selection. Thus, a patch of abnormal tissue may arise. The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. Below the photo, there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer).

In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3&amp;nbsp;cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated, in the diagram below the photo, by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon.  In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.

If the general process by which sporadic colon cancers arise is the formation of a pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) would reflect the earliest event in formation of a malignant neoplasm.

In experimental evaluation of specific DNA repair deficiencies in cancers, many specific DNA repair deficiencies were also shown to occur in the field defects surrounding those cancers. The Table, below, gives examples for which the DNA repair deficiency in a cancer was shown to be caused by an epigenetic alteration, and the somewhat lower frequencies with which the same epigenetically caused DNA repair deficiency was found in the surrounding field defect.

The high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defects giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in this section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. The large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to at about 10&amp;nbsp;cm on each side of a cancer) were shown by Facista et al.&lt;ref name=Facista /&gt; to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins ([[ERCC1]], XPF or [[PMS2]]) in the entire area of the field defect. Deficiencies in DNA repair cause increased mutation rates.&lt;ref name=Narayanan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hegan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tutt /&gt; A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone [[DNA repair|translesion synthesis]] past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations. These new mutations or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cells acquire additional mutations/epimutations that do provide a proliferative advantage.

== Etymology ==
The term ''neoplasm'' is a synonym of ''tumor''. ''Neoplasia'' denotes the process of the formation of neoplasms/tumors, and the process is referred to as a ''neoplastic'' process. The word ''neoplastic'' itself comes from Greek ''neo'' 'new' and ''plastic'' 'formed, molded'.

The term ''tumor'' derives from the [[Latin]] noun ''tumor'' 'a swelling', ultimately from the verb ''tumēre'' 'to swell'. In the British Commonwealth, the spelling ''tumour'' is commonly used, whereas in the U.S. the word is usually spelled ''tumor''.

In its medical sense, ''tumor'' has traditionally meant an abnormal swelling of the flesh. The Roman medical encyclopedist [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] ({{circa}} 30 BC–38 AD) described the four cardinal signs of acute [[inflammation]] as ''tumor'', ''[[Pain|dolor]]'', ''calor'', and ''[[rubor]]'' (swelling, pain, increased heat, and redness). (His treatise, ''[[De Medicina]]'', was the first medical book printed in 1478 following the invention of the movable-type printing press.)

In contemporary English, the word ''tumor'' is often used as a synonym for a cystic (liquid-filled) growth or solid neoplasm (cancerous or non-cancerous),&lt;ref&gt;''Tumor'' in [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001310.htmMedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; with other forms of swelling often referred to as [[Swelling (medical)|"swellings"]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms occur commonly in the medical literature, where the nouns ''tumefaction'' and ''[[tumescence]]'' (derived from the adjective ''tumescent''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | tumescence}}&lt;/ref&gt; are current medical terms for non-neoplastic swelling. This type of swelling is most often caused by inflammation caused by trauma, infection, and other factors.

Tumors may be caused by conditions other than an overgrowth of neoplastic cells, however. [[Cyst]]s (such as sebaceous cysts) are also referred to as tumors, even though they have no neoplastic cells. This is standard in medical-billing terminology (especially when billing for a growth whose pathology has yet to be determined).
