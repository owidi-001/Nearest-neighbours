The '''University of Michigan''' ('''UM''', '''U-M''', '''U of M''', '''UMich''', or '''Michigan''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Founded in 1817 in [[Detroit]], as the [[History of the University of Michigan#The Catholepistemiad (1817–1821)|''Catholepistemiad'']], or the ''University of Michigania'', 20 years before the [[Michigan Territory|territory]] became a state, the university is [[Michigan]]'s oldest. The school was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the flagship university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than {{convert|780|acre|km2}} spread out over Central Campus and North Campus, two [[satellite campuses]] in [[University of Michigan–Flint|Flint]] and [[University of Michigan–Dearborn|Dearborn]], and a [[University of Michigan Detroit Center|Center]] in Detroit.

The University of Michigan was established in Detroit on August 26, 1817,&lt;ref name=Founding/&gt; as the [[History of the University of Michigan#The Catholepistemiad (1817–1821)|''Catholepistemiad'']], or the University of Michigania, by the governor and judges of [[Michigan Territory]]. Judge [[Augustus B. Woodward]] specifically invited The [[John Monteith (minister)|Rev. John Monteith]] and Father [[Gabriel Richard]], a Catholic priest, to establish the institution.  Monteith became its first president and held seven of the professorships, and Richard was vice president and held the other six professorships. Concurrently, Ann Arbor had set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha}} in the hopes of being selected as the state capital. But when [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] was chosen as the state capital, the city offered the land for a university. What would become the university moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 1837 thanks to Governor [[Stevens T. Mason]]. The original {{convert|40|acre|ha}} was the basis of the present Central Campus.&lt;ref name="central campus history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/pres/history/markers/diag.html|title=The Central Forty and The Diag (1837)|publisher=University of Michigan History and Traditions Committee|access-date=April 29, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IJirvvVN?url=http://president.umich.edu/history/markers/diag.html|archive-date=July 23, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This land was once inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa), Odawa (Ottawa), and Bodewadimi (Potawatomi) Native tribes and was obtained through the Treaty of Fort Meigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~aium/about.html|title=AIUM: About|website=www.umich.edu|access-date=March 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817172231/http://www.umich.edu/~aium/about.html|archive-date=August 17, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, the university was officially renamed the University of Michigan.  The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors. Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845.&lt;ref name="university history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/umtimeline/general.php |title=University of Michigan Timelines: General University Timeline |publisher=Bentley Historical Library |date=July 5, 2007 |access-date=December 26, 2008 |archive-date=April 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421020242/http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/umtimeline/general.php |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U-M also became the first American university to use the [[seminar]] method of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brubacher |first=John Seiler |title=Higher Education in Transition|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=187|isbn=1-56000-917-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the early students in the School of Medicine was [[Jose Celso Barbosa]], who in 1880 graduated as valedictorian and the first [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] to get a university degree in the United States.

The University of Michigan was involved with the building of the Philippine education, legal, public health systems during the era of the American colonization of the Philippines through the efforts of Michigan alumni that included [[Dean Conant Worcester]] and [[George A. Malcolm]]. Early on, colonial government officials highlighted the importance of increasing the number of teachers and primary schools in the country. President McKinley appointed teachers from various universities, tasking them with building the foundations of the Philippine education system under American control. The first wave of these men sailed from San Francisco to Manila on the ''Thomas'', also known as the “Thomasites.” Of the nearly 500 who came to the Philippines in this group, the delegation from the University of Michigan was the second largest group of teachers who arrived.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calata |first1=Alexander A. |editor1-last=McFerson |editor1-first=Hazel M. |title=Mixed Blessing: The Impact of the American Colonial Experience on Politics and Society in the Philippines |date=2002 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |isbn=9780313307911 |oclc=756515246 |pages=90–91 |chapter=The Role of Education in Americanizing Filipinos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thomasites were instrumental in the proliferation of schools and mass enrollment of students in the Philippines. Ten years following their arrival, 4,000 schools were established, and by 1920, elementary enrollment was approaching one million and high school enrollment was at 17,335.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1900 to 1920, the university constructed many new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, [[Hill Auditorium]], large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls. In 1920, the university reorganized the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives. The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s, when the [[Ivy League]] schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Gladwell |first1=Malcolm |author-link1=Malcolm Gladwell |title=Getting In: The social logic of Ivy League admissions |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=October 3, 2005 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in |access-date=March 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200216021140/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in |archive-date=February 16, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its high standards, U-M gained the nickname "Harvard of the West."&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=about.history.speech|title=Remarks of Senator John F.

After the war, enrollment expanded rapidly and by 1950, it reached 21,000, of which more than one third (or 7,700) were veterans supported by the [[G.I. Bill]]. As the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]] took hold, U-M received numerous government grants for strategic research and helped to develop peacetime uses for [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Much of that work, as well as research into alternative energy sources, is pursued via the Memorial Phoenix Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=August 28, 2010 |url=http://www.energy.umich.edu/about/#history |title=MMPEI–History |publisher=Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute |archive-date=December 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229015555/http://www.energy.umich.edu/about |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960 Presidential campaign, U.S. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] jokingly referred to himself as "a graduate of the Michigan of the East, Harvard University" in his speech proposing the formation of the [[Peace Corps]] speaking to a crowd from the front steps of the [[Michigan Union]].&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt;

[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] gave his speech outlining his [[Great Society]] program as the lead speaker during the University of Michigan's 1964 spring commencement ceremony.&lt;ref name="university history"/&gt; During the 1960s, the university campus was the site of numerous protests against the Vietnam War and university administration. On March 24, 1965, a group of U-M faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first-ever faculty-led "[[teach-in]]" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=Matthew|title=U-M faculty's historic teach-in of 30 years ago: 'A Vital Service To Their Country' |url=http://www.ns.umich.edu/MT/95/Oct95/mt11o95.html|journal=Michigan Today|date=October 1995|access-date=August 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602090041/http://www.ns.umich.edu/MT/95/Oct95/mt11o95.html|archive-date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 22, 2008 |url=https://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/dissent/teachins.php |title=A Decade of Dissent:Teach-Ins |publisher=Bentley Historical Library |access-date=August 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727123100/http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/dissent/teachins.php |archive-date=July 27, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glenn |first1=Alan |title=Teach-in + 50 |url=https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2015/03/16/teach-in-50/ |access-date=March 13, 2020 |work=Michigan Today |publisher=Office of the VP for Communications |date=March 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190615174038/https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2015/03/16/teach-in-50/ |archive-date=June 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a series of [[sit-in]]s in 1966 by ''Voice'', the campus political party of [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff.  At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department.  The occupation was ended by agreement after seven hours.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Former U-M student and noted architect [[Alden B. Dow]] designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety. But the Fleming Building's fortress-like narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and lack of exterior detail at ground level, led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof. Dow denied those rumors, claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Jake |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/04/06/CampusLife/Explained.Colemans.Castle-2827579.shtml |title=Explained: Coleman's castle |work=The Michigan Daily |date=April 6, 2007 |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-date=April 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426131943/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/04/06/CampusLife/Explained.Colemans.Castle-2827579.shtml |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, severe budget constraints slowed the university's physical development; but in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In its 2011 annual financial report, the university announced that it had dedicated $497 million per year in each of the prior 10 years to renovate buildings and infrastructure around the campus. The university also emphasized the development of computer and information technology throughout the campus.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In the early 2000s, U-M faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. At the same time, the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping [[tuition]] costs affordable. There were disputes between U-M's administration and labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization (LEO) and the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the union representing graduate student employees. These conflicts led to a series of one-day walkouts by the unions and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saini |first=Kjyot |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/03/25/News/Gsis-Walk.Out-1429731.shtml |title=GSIs walk out |date=March 25, 2005 |work=The Michigan Daily |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184907/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/03/25/News/Gsis-Walk.Out-1429731.shtml |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=April 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the university was engaged in a $2.5 billion construction campaign after an eight-year capital campaign raised $3.11 billion, at the time a record for a US public university.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=B6|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/realestate/commercial/31michigan.html|title=A Rust Belt Oasis, the University of Michigan Is Spending Billions to Grow|last=Schneider|first=Keith|date=December 30, 2008|access-date=December 31, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417103447/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/realestate/commercial/31michigan.html|archive-date=April 17, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] admissions policy reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''). President [[George W. Bush]] publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030115-7.html|title=President Bush Discusses Michigan Affirmative Action Case|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, White House|date=January 15, 2003|access-date=December 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305233331/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030115-7.html|archive-date=March 5, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding, but it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the [[University of Michigan Law School|Law School]] admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The debate continued because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed [[Michigan Civil Rights Initiative|Proposal 2]], banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.&lt;ref name="NoAffirAct"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011002095.html|title=University of Michigan Drops Affirmative Action for Now|date=January 11, 2007|agency=Associated Press|work=The Washington Post|access-date=January 12, 2007|first=David N.|last=Goodman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110151213/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011002095.html|archive-date=November 10, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum. This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results. In April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action]]'' that Proposal 2 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.&lt;ref name="NoAffirAct"/&gt;

The U-M Golf Course's signature No. 6 hole—a {{convert|310|yd|m|-1|adj=on}} par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkers—is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion [[Nick Faldo]] and golf course architect [[Tom Doak]]. The listing of "the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie" is featured in SI's Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=University of Michigan Athletic Department|work=MGoBlue|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/040506aaa.html|title=U-M Golf Course Hole Listed Among MacKenzie's Best|date=April 5, 2006|access-date=August 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902035604/http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/040506aaa.html|archive-date=September 2, 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in [[University of Michigan–Dearborn|Dearborn]] and [[University of Michigan-Flint|Flint]]. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections&lt;ref name=Hebel2004&gt;{{harvnb|Hebel|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; for overlapping eight-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regents.umich.edu/about/|title=About the Board of Regents|publisher=University of Michigan Board of Regents|access-date=December 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221204929/http://www.regents.umich.edu/about/|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 3, 2007 |access-date=December 26, 2008 |url=https://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/regents/history.php |title=Regents of the University of Michigan: Historical Background |publisher=Bentley Historical Library |archive-date=September 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908002643/http://www.bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/regents/history.php |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead, a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.&lt;ref name=Hinsdale1906_37&gt;{{harvnb|Hinsdale|1906|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of the University of Michigan]] is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the [[Michigan Constitution]] of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.&lt;ref name=StateOfMichigan1850&gt;State of Michigan, 1850, Article 13, section 8&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, the university's oldest building, located on Central Campus in Ann Arbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/campus_tour/preshouse.php |title=President's House |date=October 3, 2007 |publisher=Bentley Historical Library |access-date=December 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820232655/http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/campus_tour/preshouse.php |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Schlissel]] is the 14th and current president of the university and has served since July 2014.

===Endowment===
{{as of|2019}}, U-M's [[financial endowment]] (the "University Endowment Fund") was valued at $12.4 billion.&lt;ref name="endowment"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Office of the Vice President for Communications |title=U-M endowment up $500M after another year of strong performance |url=https://news.umich.edu/u-m-endowment-up-500m-after-another-year-of-strong-performance/ |website=University of Michigan News |access-date=June 12, 2020 |date=October 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430155351/https://news.umich.edu/u-m-endowment-up-500m-after-another-year-of-strong-performance/ |archive-date=April 30, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The endowment is primarily used according to the donors' wishes, which include the support of teaching and research. In mid-2000, U-M embarked on a fund-raising campaign called "The Michigan Difference", which aimed to raise $2.5 billion, with $800 million designated for the permanent endowment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giving.umich.edu/news/images/pdf/fall2004.pdf |title=Leaders &amp; Best – Philanthropy at Michigan |year=2004 |publisher=The University of Michigan Office of Development |access-date=August 28, 2010 |archive-date=June 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607045731/http://www.giving.umich.edu/news/images/pdf/fall2004.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slated to run through December 2008, the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gershman |first=Dave |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?/base/news-22/117949939798070.xml&amp;coll=2 |title=U-M's Michigan Difference campaign hits goal |date=May 18, 2007 |work=Ann Arbor News |access-date=May 18, 2007 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193543/http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-22%2F117949939798070.xml&amp;coll=2 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the campaign raised $3.2 billion over 8 years. Over the course of the capital campaign, 191 additional professorships were endowed, bringing the university total to 471 {{as of|2009|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.finops.umich.edu/reports/2009/campaign/|title=2009 Financial Report – The Michigan Difference {Campaign Summary}|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan |year=2009|access-date=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like nearly all colleges and universities, U-M suffered significant realized and unrealized losses in its endowment during the second half of 2008. In February 2009, a university spokesperson estimated losses of between 20 and 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Andy|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/2008-12-08/%E2%80%98u%E2%80%99-estimates-endowment-losses-20-30-percent-end-june|title='U' estimates endowment losses of 20 to 30 percent since end of June|work=The Michigan Daily|date=December 7, 2008|access-date=February 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055502/http://michigandaily.com/content/2008-12-08/%E2%80%98u%E2%80%99-estimates-endowment-losses-20-30-percent-end-june|archive-date=February 1, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student government===

Housed in the Michigan Union, the [[Student governments in the United States#University of Michigan|Central Student Government]] (CSG) is the central student government of the university. With representatives from each of the university's colleges and schools, including graduate students, CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. CSG is a 501(c)(3) organization, independent from the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csg.umich.edu/files/files/FY%202012.pdf|title=IRS Form 990, FY 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018114552/https://csg.umich.edu/files/files/FY%202012.pdf|archive-date=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years CSG has organized Airbus, a transportation service between campus and the [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]], and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.umich.edu/mgovote2006/about.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003010504/http://www.msa.umich.edu/mgovote2006/about.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 3, 2007 |title=About Voice Your Vote |year=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan CSG |access-date=March 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSG was successful at reviving [[Homecoming]] activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubert |first=Cathe |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/09/19/StudentGovernment/Homecoming.Parade.Carnival.To.Return-2977420.shtml |title=Homecoming parade, carnival to return |work=The Michigan Daily |date=September 19, 2007 |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426130223/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/09/19/StudentGovernment/Homecoming.Parade.Carnival.To.Return-2977420.shtml |archive-date=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 2013–14 school year, was instrumental in persuading the university to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodhouse|first=Kellie|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/03/how_a_persistent_student_presi.html|title=How a Persistent Student Government Got Michigan to Scrap General Admission Football Seating|date=March 12, 2014|publisher=MLive|access-date=October 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017150125/http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/03/how_a_persistent_student_presi.html|archive-date=October 17, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, CSG successfully petitioned the Ann Arbor City Council to create a Student Advisory Council to give student input into Ann Arbor city affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ann Arbor City Council Unanimously Approves Student Advisory Council|url=https://csg.umich.edu/2017/01/19/ann-arbor-city-council-unanimously-approves-student-advisory-council/|access-date=April 2, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403194746/https://csg.umich.edu/2017/01/19/ann-arbor-city-council-unanimously-approves-student-advisory-council/|archive-date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are student governance bodies in each college and school, independent of Central Student Government. Undergraduate students in the LS&amp;A are represented by the LS&amp;A Student Government (LSA SG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=https://csg.umich.edu/about/who-we-are|access-date=February 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515010245/https://csg.umich.edu/about/who-we-are|archive-date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engineering Student Government (ESG) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG), and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate (LSSS) as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA), which contains the third most constituents after CSG and LSA SG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residence Hall Government|url=http://www.housing.umich.edu/reshalls/rha|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204230644/http://www.housing.umich.edu/reshalls/rha|archive-date=February 4, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.&lt;ref name="student regent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/jun/06-29-98/edit/edit1.html |title=Denied again: University should have a student regent |work=The Michigan Daily |date=June 29, 1998 |access-date=September 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013100636/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/jun/06-29-98/edit/edit1.html |archive-date=October 13, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the statewide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0203/Oct21_02/14.shtml|title=Regent candidates discuss tuition, health care issues at forum|date=October 21, 2002|work=The University Record Online|access-date=April 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821051104/http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0203/Oct21_02/14.shtml|archive-date=August 21, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.&lt;ref name="student regent"/&gt; A change to the board's makeup would require amending the [[Michigan Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Erin |date=September 8, 1998 |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-08-98/news/news20.html |title=Board of regents says no to MSA student regent campaign fee |work=The Michigan Daily |access-date=April 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013222504/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-08-98/news/news20.html |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collegiate secret societies ===

The University of Michigan hosts three secret societies: Michigauma, Adara, and the Vulcans. Michigauma and Adara were once under the umbrella group "The Tower Society", the name referring to their historical locations in the Michigan Union tower. Michigauma was all-male while Adara was all-female, although both later became co-ed. 

*[[Order of Angell|Michigauma]], more recently known as the Order of Angell, was formed in 1902 by a group of seniors in coordination with University president James Burrill Angell. The group disbanded itself in 2021 due to public concerns about elitism and the society's history. The group was granted a lease for the top floor of the Michigan Union tower in 1932, which they referred to as the "tomb," but the society vacated the space in 2000. Until more recent reforms, the group's rituals were inspired by the culture of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref name="michigamua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodspeedupdate.com/michigamua-images.html |title=Michigamua Image Gallery |access-date=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some factions on campus identified Michigauma as a [[secret society]], but many disputed that characterization, as its member list has been published some years in ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' and the ''[[Michiganensian]]'', and online since 2006 reforms. 
*Adara, known as Phoenix, was formed in the late 1970s by women leaders on campus and disbanded itself in 2021 amid campus criticisms of secret societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Horne|first=Brooke Van|date=1970-01-01|title=Phoenix, a secret society at U-M, votes to disband permanently|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/campus-life/phoenix-female-only-secret-society-u-m-votes-disband/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=The Michigan Daily|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s they joined the tower society and occupied the sixth floor of the tower just below Michigamua.
*Vulcans, occupied the fifth floor of the Union tower though were not formally a part of the tower society. They draw their heritage from the Roman god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. The group which used to do its tapping publicly is known for its long black robes and for its financial contributions of the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]].

The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992–1993 and 1995–1999 seasons in which the payments took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cnockaert |first=Jim |title= Accident's effects still felt six years later: Roberson: It changed the athletic department|date=March 22, 2002|work=Ann Arbor News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School colors===

===Fight songs and chants===
The University of Michigan's [[fight song]], "[[The Victors]]," was written by student Louis Elbel in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the [[University of Chicago]] that won a league championship. The song was declared by [[John Philip Sousa]] as "the greatest college fight song ever written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Hondorp, Fabrikant Alexis |title=University of Michigan College Prowler Off the Record|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=College Prowler, Inc|isbn=1-59658-163-8|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song refers to the university as being "the Champions of the West." At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old [[Northwest Territory]].

Although mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. President [[Gerald Ford]] had it played by the [[United States Marine Band]] as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional "[[Hail to the Chief]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rozell |first=Mark J. |title=The Press and the Ford Presidency|date=October 15, 1992|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10350-4|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Michigan Marching Band]] performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Michelle|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/02/politics/main2320308.shtml|title=Gerald Ford Returns Home For The Last Time|date=January 3, 2007|work=CBS News|access-date=February 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221044716/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/02/politics/main2320308.shtml|archive-date=February 21, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's [[alma mater]] song is "[[The Yellow and Blue]]." A common rally cry is "[[Let's Go Blue|Let's Go Blue!]]" which has a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a [[Drum major (marching band)|drum major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stieg |first=Bill |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122081/index.htm |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |date=May 21, 1984 |work=Sports Illustrated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202160254/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122081/index.htm |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |access-date=December 25, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before "The Victors" was officially the university's fight song, the song "[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]]" was considered to be the school song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/University_Michigan_Michiganensian_Yearbook/1999/Page_186.html|title=The Michiganesian Yearbook|year=1999|page=186|access-date=April 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217110348/http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/University_Michigan_Michiganensian_Yearbook/1999/Page_186.html|archive-date=February 17, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907, a new Michigan fight song "[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]]" was written in 1911 because the line "champions of the West" was no longer appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eugene Fischer Years: 1906–1914|url=http://mmb.music.umich.edu/node/43351|work=Michigan Marching Band website|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|access-date=April 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331162125/http://mmb.music.umich.edu/node/43351|archive-date=March 31, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
