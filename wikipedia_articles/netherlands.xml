The Netherlands has been a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[Unitary state|unitary structure]] since 1848.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Terminology of the Low Countries}}

The Netherlands' turbulent history and shifts of power resulted in exceptionally many and widely varying names in different languages. There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form.

===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===
The region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'', ''Nieder'', ''Nedre'', ''Nether'', ''Lage(r)'' or ''Low(er)'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in low-lying places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Super(ior)'', ''Up(per)'', ''Op(per)'', ''Ober'', ''Boven'', ''High'', ''Haut'' or ''Hoch''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.&lt;ref name="Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |access-date=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |access-date=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.

The [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled from their residence in the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par deçà'' ("the lands over here") for the Low Countries, as opposed to ''les pays de par delà'' ("the lands over there") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.&lt;ref name="BlockmansPrevenier2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369–1530 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&amp;q=duke+pays+de+par+deçà&amp;pg=PA85 |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par deçà'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' ("lands down-here"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=59Pae06JSiUC&amp;q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&amp;pg=PA342 |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520–1559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria. This was translated as ''Neder-landen'' in contemporary Dutch official documents.&lt;ref name="Lem"&gt;{{cite web |last=Van der Lem |first=Anton |title=De Opstand in de Nederlanden 1555–1609;De landen van herwaarts over |url = http://www.dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/dutch/verhaal/Pages/verhaal01.aspx |access-date=11 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a regional point of view, ''Niderlant'' was also the area between the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and the lower [[Rhine]] in the late Middle Ages. The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].

From the mid-sixteenth century on, the "Low Countries" and the "Netherlands" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language-speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', "Federated Netherlands", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', "Royal Netherlands", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term "Low Countries" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymously with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].

===Holland===
The Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. However, Holland proper is only a region within the country that consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces. Formerly they were a single province, and earlier the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]] which also included parts of present-day [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |access-date=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |access-date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|access-date=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the name "Holland" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |access-date=31 March 2014 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are "holland.com" and "hollandtradeandinvest.com".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] "Holland vs Netherlands – Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=17 January 2020|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=17 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020, however, the Dutch government announced that it would only communicate and advertise under the name "the Netherlands" in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|access-date=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch===
The term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*þiudiskaz'', [[Onomastic Latinisation|Latinised]] into [[Theodiscus]], meaning "popular" or "of the people"; akin to Old Dutch ''Dietsch'', Old High German ''duitsch'', and Old English ''þeodisc'', all meaning "(of) the common (Germanic) people". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*þiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. Although it had a short resurgence after World War II to avoid the reference to Germany. It is still used in the expression "diets maken" – to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).

{{Cleanup section|reason=poor referencing, style issues|date=August 2020}}
In Dutch, the names for the Netherlands, the Dutch language and a Dutch citizen are ''Nederland'', ''Nederlands'' and ''Nederlander'', respectively. Colloquially the country is also by the Dutch often referred to as [[Holland]], although to lesser extent outside the two provinces North and South Holland, where it may even be used as a [[pejorative]] term, e.g. Hollènder (dialect) in [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mijnwoordenboek.nl/dialect-vertaler.php?woord=hollander|title=Dialectenwoordenboek|website=www.mijnwoordenboek.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plural ''Nederlanden'' has been used in many different connotations in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nederlanden&amp;oldid=56949405|title=Nederlanden|date=20 August 2020|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{circular reference |date=February 2021}} but since 1815, it is only used in the official name ''Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'' ("[[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]"). In many other languages the plural stuck, for example ''Niederlande'' ([[German language|German]]), ''Pays-Bas'' ([[French language|French]]) and ''Países Bajos'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]). In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (a former colony) the country is called ''Belanda'', a name derived from 'Holland'.

===Prehistory (before 800 BC)===

[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BC)]]

The prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography. The oldest human ([[Neanderthal]]) traces were found in higher soils, near [[Maastricht]], from what is believed to be about 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roebroeks|first1=Wil|last2=Sier|first2=Mark J.|last3=Nielsen|first3=Trine Kellberg|last4=Loecker|first4=Dimitri De|last5=Parés|first5=Josep Maria|last6=Arps|first6=Charles E.

From [[Mesolithic Europe|Mesolithic]] [[Maglemosian culture|Maglemosian-like tribes]] (c. 8000 BC) the [[Pesse canoe|oldest canoe]] in the world was found in [[Drenthe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Van Zeist | first1 = W. | title = De steentijd van Nederland | journal=Nieuwe Drentse Volksalmanak | volume = 75 | pages = 4–11 | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous late Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s from the [[Swifterbant culture]] (c. 5600 BC) were related to the southern Scandinavian [[Ertebølle culture]] and were strongly linked to rivers and open water.&lt;ref name="Kooijmans1998"&gt;Louwe Kooijmans, L.P., "[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/1108/171_060.pdf?sequence=1 Trijntje van de Betuweroute, Jachtkampen uit de Steentijd te Hardinxveld-Giessendam]", 1998, ''Spiegel Historiael'' 33, pp. 423–428&lt;/ref&gt; Between 4800 and 4500 BC, the Swifterbant people started to copy from the neighbouring [[Linear Pottery culture]] the practise of [[animal husbandry]], and between 4300 and 4000 BC the practice of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Volkskrant 24 August 2007 "[http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article455140.ece/Prehistorische_akker_gevonden_bij_Swifterbant Prehistoric agricultural field found in Swifterbant, 4300–4000 BC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919141403/http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article455140.ece/Prehistorische_akker_gevonden_bij_Swifterbant |date=19 September 2009 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (c. 4300–2800 BC), which is related to the Swifterbant culture, erected the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments found in Drenthe. There was a quick and smooth transition from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-European [[Corded Ware]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture (c. 2950 BC). In the southwest, the [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]] — which was related to the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (c. 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers — survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period, until it too was succeeded by the Corded Ware culture.

Of the subsequent [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]] (2700–2100 BC) several regions of origin have been postulated, notably the Iberian peninsula, the Netherlands and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Harry |editor-last=Fokkens |editor-first2=Franco |editor-last2=Nicolis |title=Background to beakers : inquiries in regional cultural backgrounds to the Bell Beaker complex|date=2012|publisher=Sidestone|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-8890-084-6|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; They introduced metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze and opened international trade routes not seen before, reflected in the discoveries of [[Copper Age Europe|copper artifacts]], as the metal is not normally found in Dutch soil.

The initial phase of the Elp culture was characterised by [[tumulus|tumuli]] (1800–1200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia and was apparently related to the [[Tumulus culture]] in central Europe. The subsequent phase was that of cremating the dead and placing their ashes in urns which were then buried in fields, following the customs of the [[Urnfield culture]] (1200–800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the related [[Hilversum culture]] (1800–800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.

===Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC–410 AD)===
{{Main|Iron Age Europe|Celts|Germanic peoples|Netherlands in the Roman era}}
[[File:Celtic expansion in Europe.svg|thumb|left|{{legend|#FFFF43|[[Historical linguistics|Diachronic]] distribution of [[Celts]] from 500 BC}}{{legend|#97FFB6|Expansion into the southern [[Low Countries]] by 270 BC}}]]

From 800 BC onwards, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] became influential, replacing the [[Hilversum culture]]. Iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country, including [[bog iron]]. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand. The [[Vorstengraf (Oss)|King's grave of Oss]] (700 BC) was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.

The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC further deteriorated around 650 BC and might have triggered migration of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th edition, 22:641–642&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verhaal"&gt;de Vries, Jan W., Roland Willemyns and Peter Burger, ''Het verhaal van een taal'', Amsterdam: Prometheus, 2003, pp. 12, 21–27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Sea Germanic]] [[Ingaevones]] inhabited the northern part of the [[Low Countries]]. They would later develop into the [[Frisii]] and the early [[Saxons]].&lt;ref name="Verhaal" /&gt; A second grouping, the [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]] (or [[Istvaeones]]), extended along the middle Rhine and [[Weser]] and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the [[Salian Franks]].&lt;ref name="Verhaal" /&gt; Also the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[La Tène culture]] (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest) had expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the [[Low Countries]]. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Iron Age [[Nordwestblock]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;Hachmann, Rolf, Georg Kossack and Hans Kuhn, ''Völker zwischen Germanen und Kelten'', 1986, pp. 183–212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lendering"&gt;Lendering, Jona, [https://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/inferior.htm "Germania Inferior"], Livius.org.

[[File:Germania 70.svg|thumb|The Rhine frontier around 70 AD]]
The first author to describe the coast of [[Holland]] and [[Flanders]] was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[geographer]] [[Pytheas]], who noted in c. 325 BC that in these regions, "more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lendering |first1=Jona |title=The Edges of the Earth (3) – Livius |url=https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/the-edges-of-the-earth-1/the-edges-of-the-earth-3/ |website=www.livius.org |access-date=28 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gallic Wars]], the area south and west of the [[Rhine]] was conquered by [[Roman Empire|Roman forces]] under [[Julius Caesar]] from 57 BC to 53 BC.&lt;ref name="Lendering"/&gt; Caesar describes two main Celtic tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands: the [[Menapii]] and the [[Eburones]]. The Rhine became fixed as Rome's northern frontier around 12 AD. Notable towns would arise along the [[Limes Germanicus]]: [[Nijmegen]] and [[Voorburg]]. In the first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], the area south of the Limes became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule (but not its presence and control), while the Germanic border tribes of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] and [[Cananefates]] served in the [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|Roman cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;Roymans, Nico, ''Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire'', Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2005, pp 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; The Batavi rose against the Romans in the [[Revolt of the Batavi|Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD but were eventually defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century.&lt;ref name="Previté-Orton"&gt;Previté-Orton, Charles, ''The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History'', vol. I, pp. 51–52, 151&lt;/ref&gt; Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. They were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in [[West Flanders]] and the Southwest Netherlands, they were raiding the [[English Channel]]. Roman forces pacified the region, but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] (358) when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as ''[[foederati]]'' in [[Texandria]].&lt;ref name="Previté-Orton"/&gt; It has been postulated that after deteriorating climate conditions and the Romans' withdrawal, the [[Frisii]] disappeared as ''[[laeti]]'' in c. 296, leaving the coastal lands largely unpopulated for the next two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Grane|first=Thomas|year=2007|contribution=From Gallienus to Probus – Three decades of turmoil and recovery|title=The Roman Empire and Southern Scandinavia–a Northern Connection!

After [[Roman Empire|Roman]] government in the area collapsed, the Franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, [[Clovis I]] had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one [[Frankish kingdom]], and from there continued his conquests into [[Gaul]]. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population.&lt;ref name="Verhaal"/&gt; A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. the southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking [[Old Frankish]], which by the ninth century had evolved into [[Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Verhaal"/&gt; A Dutch-French language boundary hence came into existence.&lt;ref name="Verhaal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j10lCgAAQBAJ|title=History of the Low Countries|last=Blom|first=J.

The Frankish [[Carolingian empire]] modelled itself on the Roman Empire and controlled much of Western Europe. However, in 843, it was divided into three parts—[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 "Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking expedition led by [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]], raided the Frisian lands. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.

{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the "[[Frisian freedom]]"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.

Around 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.

Around 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy — who was also Count of Flanders — to conquer Holland.

Most of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a [[personal union]] by Philip the Good, Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], in 1433. The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.

Under Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, under Phillip II, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks...

Netherlanders were "burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive" by his "[[Council of Troubles|Blood Council]]" and his Spanish soldiers. Severed heads and decapitated corpses were displayed along streets and roads to terrorize the population into submission.

The first great siege was Alba's effort to capture [[Haarlem]] and thereby cut Holland in half. It dragged on from December 1572 to the next summer, when Haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 July upon the promise that the city would be spared from being sacked. It was a stipulation [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique]] was unable to honour, when his soldiers mutinied, angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions they endured during the long, cold months of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnade |first1=Peter J. |title=Beggars, Iconoclasts, and Civic Patriots: The Political Culture of the Dutch Revolt |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 1576, Spanish [[tercio]]s seized [[Antwerp]] and subjected it to the worst pillage in the Netherlands' history. The citizens resisted, but were overcome; seven thousand of them were mowed down; a thousand buildings were torched; men, women, and children were slaughtered in a delirium of blood by soldiers crying, "Santiago!

Following the [[sack of Antwerp]], delegates from Catholic Brabant, Protestant Holland and Zeeland agreed, at Ghent, to join Utrecht and William the Silent in driving out all Spanish troops and forming a new government for the Netherlands. [[Don Juan of Austria]], the new Spanish governor, was forced to concede initially, but within months returned to active hostilities. As the fighting restarted, the Dutch began to look for help from the Queen of England, but she initially stood by her commitments to the Spanish in the [[Treaty of Bristol]] of 1574. The result was that when the next large-scale battle did occur at [[Gembloux]] in 1578, the Spanish forces easily won the day, killing at least 10,000 rebels, with the Spanish suffering few losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillespie |first1=Alexander |title=The Causes of War: Volume III: 1400 CE to 1650 CE |date=2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the [[Battle of Gembloux (1578)|defeat at Gembloux]], the southern states of the Seventeen Provinces (today in northern France and Belgium) distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579 [[Union of Arras]], which expressed their loyalty to [[Philip II of Spain]]. Opposing them, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the [[Union of Utrecht]] (also of 1579) in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army.&lt;ref&gt;Motley, John Lothrop (1855).

Parts of the southern provinces became ''de facto'' colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire.

After declaring their independence, the provinces of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[Lordship of Groningen|Groningen]], [[Lordship of Friesland|Friesland]], [[Lordship of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Lordship of Overijssel|Overijssel]], and [[Duchy of Gelderland|Gelderland]] formed a [[confederation]]. All these duchies, lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government, the [[States-Provincial]]. The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], the confederal government, were seated in [[The Hague]] and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of [[Lordship of Drenthe|Drenthe]] was part of the republic too, although it was not considered one of the provinces. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the [[Eighty Years' War]] a number of so-called [[Generality Lands]] in [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]]. Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own, and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled [[Southern Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjTSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|title=The Dutch Republic in the Seventeenth Century: The Golden Age|last=Prak|first=Maarten|date=22 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316342480|language=en}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]], spanning much of the 17th century, the [[Dutch Empire]] grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers, alongside Portugal, Spain, France and England. Science, military, and art (especially [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painting]]) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display_printable.cfm?HHID=682 |title=The Middle Colonies: New York |access-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114182245/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display_printable.cfm?HHID=682 |archive-date=14 January 2012 }} Digital History.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]] established [[colonization|colonies]] and [[trading post]]s all over the world, including ruling the northern parts of [[Taiwan]] between [[Taiwan under Dutch rule|1624–1662 and 1664–1667]]. The [[New Netherland|Dutch settlement in North America]] began with the founding of [[New Amsterdam]] on the southern part of [[Manhattan]] in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the [[Cape Colony]] in 1652. [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch colonies in South America]] were established along the many rivers in the fertile [[Guyana]] plains, among them [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Colony of Surinam]] (now [[Suriname]]). In Asia, the Dutch established the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), and the only western trading post in Japan, [[Dejima]].

During the period of [[Proto-industrialization]], the empire received 50% of textiles and 80% of silks import from the India's [[Mughal Empire]], chiefly from its most developed region known as [[Bengal Subah]].&lt;ref name="tong"&gt;{{cite book |author=Junie T.

Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly [[capitalism|capitalist]] country in the world. In early modern Europe, it had the wealthiest trading city ([[Amsterdam]]) and the first full-time [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|stock exchange]]. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the [[Boom and bust|boom-bust cycle]], the world's first [[Asset price inflation|asset-inflation bubble]], the [[tulip mania]] of 1636–1637, and the world's first [[bear raid]]er, [[Isaac le Maire]], who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n07/murray-sayle/japan-goes-dutch|title=Japan Goes Dutch|magazine=London Review of Books|date=5 April 2001|author=Sayle, Murray |volume=23|issue=7|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1672 – known in Dutch history as the [[Rampjaar]] (Disaster Year) – the Dutch Republic was at war with France, England and three German Bishoprics simultaneously. At sea, it could successfully prevent the English and French navy from entering the western shores. On land, however, it was almost taken over internally by the advancing French and German armies coming from the east. It managed to turn the tide by [[Hollandic Water Line|inundating parts of Holland]] but could never recover to its former glory again and went into a state of a general decline in the 18th century, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican [[Dutch States Party|''Staatsgezinden'']] and the supporters of the [[stadtholder]] the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|''Prinsgezinden'']] as main [[political faction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koopmans|first1=Joop W.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Netherlands|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442255937|pages=233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GU-xCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=main+political+factions+dutch+society+18th+century&amp;pg=PA271|language=en|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batavian Republic and Kingdom (1795–1890)===
{{Main|Batavian Republic|Kingdom of Holland|Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands}}

With the armed support of [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]], [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Dutch republicans]] proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]], modelled after the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] and rendering the Netherlands a [[unitary state]] on 19 January 1795. The [[stadtholder]] [[William V of Orange]] had fled to England. But from 1806 to 1810, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was set up by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] to control the Netherlands more effectively. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813 when Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig]].

[[William I of the Netherlands|William Frederick]], son of the last stadtholder, returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands]]. Two years later, the [[Congress of Vienna]] added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France. William Frederick raised this [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|United Netherlands]] to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself as [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] in 1815. In addition, William became hereditary [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] in exchange for his German possessions. However, the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and [[Belgian Revolution|rebelled]]. The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium (recognised by the Northern Netherlands in 1839 as the Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by decree), while the [[personal union]] between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890, when [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] died with no surviving male heirs. [[Salic Law|Ascendancy laws]] prevented his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] from becoming the next Grand Duchess.

The Belgian Revolution at home and the [[Java War]] in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the [[Cultivation System]] was introduced in 1830; in the Dutch East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient.

The Netherlands abolished slavery in its colonies in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman and Miller, ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery'' 2:637&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves in [[Suriname]] would be fully free only in 1873, since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/webdossiers/dutch-involvement-transatlantic-slave-trade-and-abolition|title=Dutch involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and abolition|work=ascleiden.nl|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands was able to remain neutral during [[World War I]], in part because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival until the blockade by the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1916.&lt;ref name="Abbenhuis"&gt;Abbenhuis, Maartje M.

The [[Rotterdam Blitz]] forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender four days later.

In 1954, the [[Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] reformed the political structure of the Netherlands, which was a result of international pressure to carry out [[decolonisation]]. The Dutch colonies of [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Surinam]] and [[Curaçao and Dependencies]] and the European country all became countries within the Kingdom, on a basis of equality. Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945 (recognised in 1949), and thus was never part of the reformed Kingdom. [[Suriname]] followed in 1975. After the war, the Netherlands left behind an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighbouring states. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the [[Benelux]], the [[NATO]], [[Euratom]] and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would evolve into the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] ([[Common Market]]) and later the [[European Union]].

Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce [[population density]] prompted some 500,000 [[Dutch people]] to leave the country after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409956/Netherlands |title=Netherlands |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |access-date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-[[pillarisation]] characterised by the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines. Youths, and students in particular, rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as [[women's rights]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[disarmament]] and [[environmental issues]]. In 2002 the [[euro]] was introduced as [[fiat money]], and in 2010 the [[Netherlands Antilles]] was [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolved]]. Referendums were held on each island to determine their future status. As a result, the islands of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]] (the BES islands) were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands. This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as ''[[Special municipality (Netherlands)|special municipalities]]'' upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation in the Netherlands|land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.

Much of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]]. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a [[river delta]] of these three rivers, the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].

The European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the [[Waal (river)|Waal]], its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past, these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their "Great Rivers" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).&lt;ref name="international2000"&gt;Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000–2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Netherlands formed as a result of the interplay of the four main rivers ([[Rhine]], [[Meuse]], [[Schelde]] and [[IJssel]]) and the influence of the [[North Sea]]. The Netherlands is mostly composed of [[river delta|deltaic]], [[coast]]al and [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] derived sediments during the [[Pleistocene]] [[glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods.

Almost the entire west Netherlands is composed of the [[Rhine]]-[[Meuse]] river [[estuary]], but [[civilisation|human intervention]] greatly modified the natural processes at work. Most of the western Netherlands is below sea level due to the human process of turning standing bodies of water into usable land, a [[polder]].

In the east of the Netherlands, remains are found of the last [[ice age]], which ended approximately ten thousand years ago. As the continental [[ice sheet]] moved in from the north, it pushed [[moraine]] forward. The ice sheet halted as it covered the eastern half of the Netherlands. After the ice age ended, the [[moraine]] remained in the form of a long hill-line. The cities of [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]] are built upon these hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wong |first1=Th.E. |last2= Batjes |first2=D.A.J.|last3= Jager|first3=J. de|year= 2007 |title=Geology of the Netherlands |publisher= [[KNAW]] |isbn=978-90-6984-481-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===

[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]

Over the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.

On 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth flood]] of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed [[polder]], replacing it with the {{convert|72|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} ''[[Biesbosch]]'' tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the "[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.

[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]
The impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th-century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.

Because of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Duplessis, Robert S. (1997) ''Transitions to Capitalism in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-39773-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Netherlands, Zoetermeer, Zoetermeerse Meerpolder (1).JPG|thumb|A polder at 5.53 metres below sea level]]
To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]"'' ("water boards") or ''"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]"'' ("high home councils") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|access-date=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' ("Closure Dike") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake). It became part of the larger [[Zuiderzee Works]] in which four polders totalling {{convert|2500|km2|mi2|0}} were reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gemeentes/gem533nh.htm |publisher=sdu.nl |title=Kerngegevens gemeente Wieringermeer |access-date=21 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106163025/http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gemeentes/gem533nh.htm |archive-date=6 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/PROVINCIES/flevoland.htm |publisher=sdu.nl |title=Kerngegevens procincie Flevoland |access-date=21 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226115958/http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/PROVINCIES/flevoland.htm |archive-date=26 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from [[climate change]]. Not only is the rising sea a problem, but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nickerson |first=Colin |title=Netherlands relinquishes some of itself to the waters |work=Boston Globe |date=5 December 2005 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/12/05/holland_goes_beyond_holding_back_the_tide/ |access-date=10 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630210923/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/12/05/holland_goes_beyond_holding_back_the_tide/ |archive-date=30 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Olsthoorn |first=A.A. |author2=Richard S.J.

===Delta Works===
{{Main|Delta Works|Flood control in the Netherlands}}
[[File:Deltawerken na.png|thumb|left|The [[Delta Works]] are located in the provinces of [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].]]
[[File:Nijlânnermolen Workum.jpg|thumb|[[Workum]], [[Friesland]]]]
[[File:Floroj en Lisse.jpg|thumb|[[Lisse]], [[North Holland]]]]

After the [[North Sea Flood of 1953|1953 disaster]], the [[Delta Works]] was constructed, which is a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. The main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to once per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising {{convert|3000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of outer sea-dikes and {{convert|10000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dike reinforcements. The Delta project is considered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] as one of the [[Wonders of the World#American Society of Civil Engineers|seven wonders of the modern world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asce.org/Content.aspx?id=2147487305 Seven Wonders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802060056/http://www.asce.org/Content.aspx?id=2147487305 |date=2 August 2010 }}. Asce.org (19 July 2010). Retrieved on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is anticipated that [[global warming]] in the 21st century will result in a rise in [[sea level]]. The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea-level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea-level rise of {{convert|1.10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} and a simultaneous land height decline of {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|0}}. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like [[Levee|dike]]s and [[dune]]s with {{convert|1.30|m|ft|abbr=on}} of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the seaside but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another programme is already being executed. The [[Room for the River (Netherlands)|Room for the River plan]] grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called "overflow areas" have been moved to higher ground, with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.&lt;ref name=NYT021313&gt;{{cite news|title=Going With the Flow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/design/flood-control-in-the-netherlands-now-allows-sea-water-in.html|access-date=19 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 February 2013|author=Kimmelman, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===

The predominant wind direction in the European Netherlands is southwest, which causes a mild [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], with moderately warm summers and cool winters, and typically high humidity. This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline, where the difference in temperature between summer and winter, as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country.

Ice days—maximum temperature below {{convert|0|C|F|0}}—usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days—minimum temperature below {{convert|0|C|F|0}}—occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid-October and as late as mid-May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} above ground instead of {{convert|150|cm|0|abbr=on}}, one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April but sometimes occurs in May or October too.

Warm days—maximum temperature above {{convert|20|C|F|0}}—are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in {{Not a typo|De Bilt}}, however). Summer days—maximum temperature above {{convert|25|C|F|0}}—are usually measured in {{Not a typo|De Bilt}} from May until September, tropical days—maximum temperature above {{convert|30|C|F|0}}—are rare and usually occur only in June to August.

Precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer when lightning is also much more frequent).

The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.

The following table are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1991 and 2020. The highest recorded temperature was reached on 25 July 2019 in [[Gilze-Rijen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/nieuws/temperatuur-door-historische-grens-van-40-c | title=KNMI – Temperatuur door historische grens van 40°C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves, that include [[lake]]s, [[heathland]], [[Woodland|woods]], [[dune]]s, and other habitats. Most of these are owned by [[Staatsbosbeheer]], the national department for [[forestry]] and [[Habitat conservation|nature conservation]] and [[Vereniging Natuurmonumenten|Natuurmonumenten]] (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the [[Wadden Sea]] in the north, with its [[tidal flat]]s and [[wetland]]s, is rich in [[biodiversity|biological diversity]], and was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Nature Site]] in 2009.

[[File:Phoca vitulina Terschelling.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harbor seal|Common seals]] on [[Terschelling]], a [[Wadden Sea]] island]]
The [[Oosterschelde]], formerly the northeast [[estuary]] of the river [[Scheldt]] was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde but also includes mudflats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]]. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]].

While [[Curaçao]], [[Aruba]] and [[Sint Maarten]] have a [[Constituent state|constituent country]] status, the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands. The islands are part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and have land borders with [[France]] ([[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]) and maritime borders with [[Anguilla]], [[Curaçao]], [[France]] ([[Saint Barthélemy]]), [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Sint Maarten]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="Caribbean-Borders"/&gt;

Within this island group:
* [[Bonaire]] is part of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] within the [[Leeward Antilles]] island chain off the [[Venezuela]]n coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin.
* [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] are part of the [[SSS islands]]. They are located east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|abbr=on}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

The islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to [[hurricanes]].

== Government and politics==
[[File:Den Haag - panoramio - Nikolai Karaneschev.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Binnenhof]], where the lower and upper houses of the States General meet]]

The Netherlands has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] since 1815, and due to the efforts of [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]]&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=nl |date=13 March 1998 |access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] in 1848. The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].

The [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.&lt;!-- Commented out: "The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties." Information: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --&gt; By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].

}}
The [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party of the governing coalition continuously since 1973.

The cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.

===Political culture===

[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]
Both trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.

The Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buruma|first=Ybo|date=2007|title=Dutch Tolerance: On Drugs, Prostitution, and Euthanasia|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/650185|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=35|issue=1|pages=73–113|doi=10.1086/650185|jstor=10.1086/650185|s2cid=144295342|issn=0192-3234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch [[criminal justice system of the Netherlands|criminal justice]] policies on [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|recreational drugs]], [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]], [[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|LGBT rights]], [[euthanasia]], and [[abortion in the Netherlands|abortion]], which are among the most liberal in the world.

===Political parties===
{{Main|Political parties of the Netherlands|Politics of the Netherlands}}
[[File:Ineke van Gent, Han ten Broeke en Kees Verhoeven, Lancering Europese Mobiliteitsweek 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate. From left to right, members of the House of Representatives [[Sander de Rouwe]] (CDA), [[Ineke van Gent]] (GL), [[Han ten Broeke]] (VVD), [[Kees Verhoeven]] (D66) and [[Farshad Bashir]] (SP), 2010]]

Because of the [[Political parties of the Netherlands|multi-party system]], no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, as a result, [[coalition government|coalition cabinets]] had to be formed. Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.

These parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).

In the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A "[[Purple (government)|purple]]" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right-wing [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].

In June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]]. A [[Third Balkenende cabinet|caretaker cabinet]] was formed by the CDA and VVD, and [[Dutch general election, 2006|general elections]] were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] made the largest gains. The [[2006–07 Dutch cabinet formation|formation of a new cabinet]] took three months, resulting in a [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-4|coalition]] of CDA, PvdA, and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]].

On 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in [[Uruzgan]], Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kabinet valt over Uruzgan-besluit |newspaper=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=20 February 2010 |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223041947/http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1350355.ece/Kabinet_valt_over_Uruzgan-besluit |archive-date=23 February 2010 |access-date=20 February 2010 |author1=Dirks, Bart |author2=Koelé, Theo |name-list-style=amp |language=nl |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snap election]]s were held on [[Dutch general election, 2010|9 June 2010]], with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats. The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats.

VVD and PvdA won a majority in the House of Representatives during the [[Dutch general election, 2012|2012 general election]]. On 5 November 2012 they formed the [[second Rutte cabinet]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 general election]], [[VVD]], [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], [[Democrats 66]] and [[ChristenUnie]] formed the [[third Rutte cabinet]]. This cabinet resigned in January 2021, two months before the general election, after a [[Netherlands child welfare fraud scandal|child welfare fraud scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b37fa75e-af06-4f40-8c26-76c70abe1af2 |title=Dutch government resigns over child benefits scandal |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |access-date=16 January 2021|date=16 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2021, centre-right VVD of Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] was the winner of the [[2021 Netherlands general election|elections]], securing  35 out of 150 seats. The second biggest party was the centre-left D66 with 24 seats. [[Geert Wilders]]' far-right party lost its support. Prime Minister Mark Rutte, in power since 2010, formed his fourth coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56436297&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map provinces Netherlands-en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Provinces of the Netherlands|Provinces]] and [[Caribbean Netherlands#Administration|territories]] of the Netherlands]]

The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, each under a [[King's Commissioner]] (''Commissaris van de Koning''). Informally in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg province]] this position is named Governor (''Gouverneur''). All provinces are divided into [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] (''gemeenten''), of which there are 355 (2019).&lt;ref name=MUNICPS&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/classificaties/overig/gemeentelijke-indelingen-per-jaar/indeling%20per%20jaar/gemeentelijke-indeling-op-1-januari-2019 |title = Gemeentelijke indeling op 1 januari 2019 |trans-title = Municipalities on 1 January 2019 |language = nl |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 1 January 2019 |work = CBS Classifications |publisher = [[Statistics Netherlands|CBS]] |access-date = 7 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is also subdivided into 21 water districts, governed by a [[Water board (Netherlands)|water board]] (''waterschap'' or ''hoogheemraadschap''), each having authority in matters concerning water management.&lt;ref name=WATER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvw.nl/de-waterschappen.html |title=De waterschappen |language=nl |access-date=7 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103064157/http://www.uvw.nl/de-waterschappen.html |archive-date=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.waterschappen.nl/mijn-waterschap/ |title=Mijn waterschap |language=nl |access-date=6 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence. Direct elections of the water boards take place every four years.

The administrative structure on the three BES islands, collectively known as the [[Caribbean Netherlands]], is outside the twelve provinces. These islands have the status of ''openbare lichamen ([[Public body (Netherlands)|public bodies]])''.&lt;ref name=WOLBES&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eerstekamer.nl/wetsvoorstel/31954_wet_openbare_lichamen|title=31.954, Wet openbare lichamen Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba|language=nl|publisher=Eerste kamer der Staten-Generaal|quote=De openbare lichamen vallen rechtstreeks onder het Rijk omdat zij geen deel uitmaken van een provincie. &lt;br /&gt;"Through the establishment of the BES islands as public bodies, rather than communities, the BES islands' rules may deviate from the rules in the European part of the Netherlands. The Dutch legislation will be introduced gradually. The public bodies fall directly under the central government because they are not part of a province."|access-date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands these administrative units are often referred to as ''special municipalities''.

The Netherlands has several Belgian [[Enclave and exclave|exclaves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exclave.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=10|title=Baarle-Hertog and Baarle Nassau|website=Exclave.eu|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within those even several enclaves which are part of the province of [[North Brabant]]. Because the Netherlands and Belgium are both in the [[Benelux]], and more recently in the [[Schengen Area]], citizens of respective countries can travel through these enclaves without controls.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}
[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]

The history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].

The [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].

During and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.

===Military===
{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}
[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]

The Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.

[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]
The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].

The military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):
&lt;!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands--&gt;
* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;
* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];
* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];
* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.

The submarine service opened to women on 1 January 2017. The [[Korps Commandotroepen]], the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korpscommandotroepen.nl/index.php?l=nl&amp;p=118 KCT.

The Netherlands has a developed economy and has been playing a special role in the European economy for many centuries. Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy. The Netherlands has [[List of countries by economic freedom|a high level of economic freedom]]. The Netherlands is one of the top countries in the [[Global Enabling Trade Report]] (2nd in 2016), and was ranked the fifth most competitive economy in the world by the Swiss [[International Institute for Management Development]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 2017 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking |url=http://www.imd.org/globalassets/wcc/docs/release-2017/2017-world_competitiveness_ranking.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604200349/http://www.imd.org/globalassets/wcc/docs/release-2017/2017-world_competitiveness_ranking.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 June 2017|date=4 June 2017|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the country was ranked the second most innovative nation in the world in the 2018 [[Global Innovation Index]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO (2018): The Global Innovation Index 2018: Energizing the World with Innovation.

{{As of|2020}}, the key trading partners of the Netherlands were Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, China and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/netherlands/ Netherlands]. ''[[The World Factbook]]''. [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries. Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector. Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, trade, services and tourism. Examples of international Dutch companies operating in Netherlands include [[Randstad Holding|Randstad]], [[Unilever]], [[Heineken International|Heineken]], [[KLM]], financial services ([[ING Group|ING]], [[ABN AMRO]], [[Rabobank]]), chemicals ([[DSM (company)|DSM]], [[AkzoNobel|AKZO]]), petroleum refining ([[Royal Dutch Shell]]), electronical machinery ([[Philips]], [[ASML Holding|ASML]]), and satellite navigation ([[TomTom]]).

The Netherlands has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|17th-largest economy in the world]], and [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|ranks 11th in GDP (nominal) per capita]]. Between 1997 and 2000 annual economic growth (GDP) averaged nearly 4%, well above the European average. Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown, but accelerated to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2007. In May 2013, inflation was at 2.8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inflation up to 2.8 percent|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/dossiers/conjunctuur/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-042-pb.htm|publisher=Statistics Netherlands|access-date=11 June 2013|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, unemployment was at 8.2% (or 6.7% following the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] definition) of the [[labour force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/dossiers/conjunctuur/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-035-pb.htm|title=Unemployment further up|access-date=10 June 2013|date=15 May 2013|publisher=Statistics Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2019, this was reduced to 3.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More employed in February|url=https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2019/12/more-employed-in-february|access-date=21 March 2019|date=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Q3 and Q4 2011, the Dutch economy contracted by 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, because of European Debt Crisis, while in Q4 the Eurozone economy shrunk by 0.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world_business/view/1183178/1/.html |title=Eurozone economy shrinks 0.3% in Q4 |date=15 February 2012|work=channelnewsasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands also has a relatively low [[Gini coefficient|GINI coefficient]] of 0.326.

It is situated near [[Dam Square]] in the city's centre. As a founding member of the [[euro]], the Netherlands replaced (for accounting purposes) its former currency, the "gulden" ([[Dutch guilder|guilder]]), on 1 January 1999, along with 15 other adopters of the euro. Actual [[euro coins]] and [[Euro banknotes|banknotes]] followed on 1 January 2002. One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders. In the [[Caribbean Netherlands]], the [[United States dollar]] is used instead of the euro.

The Dutch location gives it prime access to markets in the UK and Germany, with the [[Port of Rotterdam]] being the largest port in Europe. Other important parts of the economy are [[international trade]] (Dutch colonialism started with co-operative private enterprises such as the [[Dutch East India Company]]), banking and transport. The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners. Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4.2&amp;nbsp;million international visitors.&lt;ref name="42milvisitors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ez.amsterdam.nl/page.php?page=9&amp;menu=27 |title=Amsterdam en de wereld: Toerisme en congreswezen |access-date=15 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215160103/http://www.ez.amsterdam.nl/page.php?page=9&amp;menu=27 |archive-date=15 February 2009 }}. ez.amsterdam.nl&lt;/ref&gt; Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of [[migrant worker]]s have arrived in the Netherlands from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-dutch-immigrants-idUKTRE8191ML20120210 |title= Dutch allow Wilders' anti-Pole website, EU critical | work= Reuters | date=10 February 2012 |first=Gilbert |last=Kreijger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007.

===Natural gas===
[[File:Natural gas NL.png|thumb|Natural gas concessions in the Netherlands. Today the Netherlands accounts for more than 25% of all natural gas reserves in the EU.]]

Beginning in the 1950s, the Netherlands discovered huge natural gas resources. The sale of natural gas generated enormous revenues for the Netherlands for decades, adding hundreds of billions of euros to the government's budget.&lt;ref name="vorige.nrc.nl"&gt;[http://vorige.nrc.nl//international/article2274261.ece/The_Dutch_curse_how_billions_from_natural_gas_went_up_in_smoke The Dutch curse: how billions from natural gas went up in smoke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221000129/http://vorige.nrc.nl//international/article2274261.ece/The_Dutch_curse_how_billions_from_natural_gas_went_up_in_smoke |date=21 December 2016 }} LEES MEER, 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's huge energy wealth impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of [[Dutch disease]].&lt;ref name="vorige.nrc.nl"/&gt;

[[File:Wildervank natural gas field.jpg|thumb|The [[Groningen gas field]] whose discovery in 1959 transformed the Dutch economy, generating €159 billion in revenue since the mid-1970s.]]
Apart from coal and gas, the country has no mining resources. The last coal mine was closed in 1974. The [[Groningen gas field]], one of the largest [[natural-gas field]]s in the world, is situated near [[Slochteren]]. The exploitation of this field has resulted in €159&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Groningen_Gas_Field/bf349ab1.aspx|title=The Groningen Gas Field|year=2009|publisher=GEO ExPro Magazine|access-date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is operated by government-owned Gasunie and output is jointly exploited by the government, Royal Dutch Shell, and Exxon Mobil through NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij). "Gas extraction has resulted in increasingly strong earth tremors, some measuring as much as 3.6 on the Richter magnitude scale. The cost of damage repairs, structural improvements to buildings, and compensation for home value decreases has been estimated at €6.5 billion. Around 35,000 homes are said to be affected."&lt;ref&gt;UPDATE 2-Dutch gas field earthquake dangers ignored for decades -Safety Board Wed 18 February 2015, By Anthony Deutsch,18 Feb (Reuters)&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands has an estimated 25% of natural gas reserves in the EU.&lt;ref name="stp" /&gt; The energy sector accounted for almost 11% of the GDP in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Netherlands2014.pdf|title=Energy Policies of IEA Countries|publisher=International Energy Agency|access-date=23 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030846/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Netherlands2014.pdf|archive-date=5 July 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands' economy, mainly due to the large shares of natural gas reserves, is considered to have "very high" [[energy intensity]] rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energieakkoordser.nl/~/media/files/energieakkoord/publiciteit/agreement-on-energy-policy-in-practice.ashx |title=The Agreement on Energy for Sustainable Growth|publisher=SER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands is faced with future challenges as the energy supply is forecasted to fall short of the demand by the year 2025 in the gas sector. This is attributed to the depletion of the Netherlands' major gas field, Groningen, and the earthquakes that have hit the Groningen region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Netherlands2014.pdf|title=Energy Policies|publisher=IEA|access-date=23 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030846/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Netherlands2014.pdf|archive-date=5 July 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is ambiguity surrounding the feasibility of producing unconventional gas. The Netherlands relies heavily on natural gas to provide energy. Gas is the main source of heating for households in the Netherlands&lt;ref name=stp/&gt; and represented 35% of the [[energy mix]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=bbs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Netherlands.pdf|title=Netherlands Energy System Overview|publisher=IEA|access-date=23 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227075530/https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Netherlands.pdf|archive-date=27 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, The [[European Union climate and energy package|European Union 2020 package]] (20% reduction in GHG emissions, 20% renewables in the energy mix and 20% improvement in energy efficiency) enacted in 2009 has influenced the domestic energy politics of Netherlands and pressured non-state actors to give consent to more aggressive energy reforms that would reduce reliance on natural resources as a source of income to the economy.&lt;ref name=yea&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/policiesandmeasures/pams/netherlands/name-158564-en.php?s=dHlwZT1yZSZzdGF0dXM9T2s,&amp;return=PG5hdiBpZD0iYnJlYWRjcnVtYiI-PGEgaHJlZj0iLyI-SG9tZTwvYT4gJnJhcXVvOyA8YSBocmVmPSIvcG9saWNpZXNhbmRtZWFzdXJlcy8iPlBvbGljaWVzIGFuZCBNZWFzdXJlczwvYT4gJnJhcXVvOyA8YSBocmVmPSIvcG9saWNpZXNhbmRtZWFzdXJlcy9yZW5ld2FibGVlbmVyZ3kvIj5SZW5ld2FibGUgRW5lcmd5PC9hPjwvbmF2Pg |title=Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth|publisher=International Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a [[Renewable energy in the Netherlands|transition towards renewable energy]] has been a key objective by Netherlands in order to safeguard the energy security of the country from natural resources depletion, mainly gas.&lt;ref name=stp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebn.nl/oil-and-gas-in-the-netherlands/?lang=en|title=The hunt for gas and oil reserves that are more difficult to extract|publisher=EBN|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907041804/https://www.ebn.nl/oil-and-gas-in-the-netherlands/?lang=en|archive-date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands has set a 14% renewable energy target of the total energy mix by the year 2020.&lt;ref name=neo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2017/11/National%20Energy%20Outlook%202017_Summary.pdf |title=National Energy Outlook 2017|publisher=Energy Research Center of the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continuation of providing tax breaks to electricity generated by coal and gas, and to the exploration and extraction of gas from fields that are "insufficiently" profitable,&lt;ref name=EuropeanEnvironmentalAgency&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/energy-support-measures/the-netherlands-country-profile/view|title=Energy support measures and their impact on innovation|publisher=European Environmental Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; renders a successful transition towards renewable energy more difficult to achieve due to inconsistencies in the policy mix. In 2011, it was estimated that the renewable energy sector received 31% (EUR 743MM), while the conventional energy sector received 69% (EUR 1.6B), of the total [[energy subsidies]] by the government.&lt;ref name=EuropeanEnvironmentalAgency/&gt; Furthermore, the energy market in the Netherlands remains to be dominated by few major corporations Nuon, RWE, E.ON, Eneco, and Delta that have significant influence over the energy policy.&lt;ref name=deloitte&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Energy-and-Resources/gx-er-market-reform-netherlands.pdf |title=European Energy Market Reform|publisher=Deloitte}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy share in the energy mix is estimated to reach 12.4% by the year 2020, falling 1.6% short of the 14% target.&lt;ref name=neo/&gt;{{needs update|date=March 2021}}

===Agriculture and natural resources===
[[File:Dutch belted cows at Park Sonsbeek meadows in the centre of the city of Arnhem (look the background) - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Cows near the city of [[Arnhem]]]]

From a biological resource perspective, the Netherlands has a low endowment: the Netherlands’ [[biocapacity]] adds up to only 0.8 global hectares in 2016, 0.2 of which are dedicated to agriculture.&lt;ref name=footprintdata&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=150&amp;type=BCpc,EFCpc|title=Country Trends|publisher=Global Footprint Network|access-date= 15 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch biocapacity per person is just about half of the 1.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person available worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=David|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Murthy|first3=Adeline|last4=Galli|first4=Alessandro|last5=Evans|first5=Mikel|last6=Neill|first6=Evan|last7=Mancini|first7=Maria Serena|last8=Martindill|first8=Jon|last9=Medouar|first9=Fatime-Zahra|last10=Huang|first10=Shiyu|last11=Wackernagel|first11=Mathis|date=2018|title=Ecological Footprint Accounting for Countries: Updates and Results of the National Footprint Accounts, 2012–2018|journal=Resources|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=58|doi=10.3390/resources7030058|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in 2016, the Dutch used on average 4.8 global hectares of biocapacity - their [[ecological footprint]] of consumption. This means the Dutch required nearly six times as much biocapacity as the Netherlands contains.

The population of the Netherlands was predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] until the late 20th century, divided into a number of denominations. Although significant religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence. The Netherlands is now one of the most [[secular]] societies in the world.

In 2019, [[Statistics Netherlands]] found that 54.1% of the total population declared itself to be [[non-religious]].

The southern provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, and some residents consider the Catholic Church as a base for their [[Cultural Christian|cultural identity]].

Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a [[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Bible Belt]] from [[Zeeland]] to the northern parts of the province [[Overijssel]], in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.

[[Islam]] is the second largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 [[Islam in the Netherlands|Muslims]] in the Netherlands (5% of the population).&lt;ref name=CBS2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/vrije-tijd-cultuur/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2012/2012-3759-wm.htm|title=Een op de zes bezoekt regelmatig kerk of moskee|work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Netherlands|year=2012|access-date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim population increased from the 1960 as a result of large numbers of [[Demography of the Netherlands#Migration and ethnicity|migrant workers]].

During the 1990s, [[Muslim refugees]] arrived from countries like [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scp.nl/publicaties/boeken/9037702597/Godsdienstige_veranderingen.pdf |title=Godsdienstige veranderingen in Nederland |access-date=17 May 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070125142251/http://www.scp.nl/publicaties/boeken/9037702597/Godsdienstige_veranderingen.pdf |archive-date = 25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another religion practised is [[Hinduism]], with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are [[Indo-Surinamese]]. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and some Western adherents of [[Hinduism in the West|Hinduism-oriented new religious movements]] such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 [[Buddhism in the Netherlands|Buddhists]] or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. In addition, there are about 45,000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jews]] in the Netherlands.

The Constitution of the Netherlands guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Roman Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], and two small parties, [[ChristianUnion]] and [[Reformed Political Party|SGP]]) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, [[Pentecost]] and the [[Ascension of Jesus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beleven.org/feesten/lijsten/landen.php?land=Nederland |title=Feestdagen Nederland |publisher=Beleven.org |access-date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the country's independence, Protestants were predominant in most of the country, while Roman Catholics were dominant in the south, especially North Brabant and Limburg. In the late 19th century, secularism, atheism and [[pillarisation]] gained adherents. By 1960, Roman Catholics equalled Protestants in number; thereafter, both Christian branches began to decline. Conversely, Islam grew considerably as the result of [[Demography of the Netherlands#Migration and ethnicity|immigration]]. Since 2000 there has been raised awareness of religion, mainly due to [[Muslim extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;Knippenberg, Hans "The Changing Religious Landscape of Europe" edited by Knippenberg published by Het Spinhuis, Amsterdam 2005 {{ISBN|90-5589-248-3}}, pages 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch royal family]] has been traditionally associated with [[Calvinism]], specifically the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which has merged into the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]]. The Dutch Reformed Church was the only major [[Protestant]] church in the Netherlands from the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] until the 19th century. Denominational splits [[1834 Dutch Reformed Church split|in 1834]] and [[1886 Dutch Reformed Church split|in 1886]] diversified Dutch Calvinism. In 2013, a [[Roman Catholic]] became [[Queen consort]].

A survey in December 2014 concluded that for the first time there were more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands, while the remainder of the population was agnostic (31%) or [[ietsism|ietsistic]] (27%).&lt;ref name="trouw.nl"&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Beek|first1=Marije|title=Ongelovigen halen de gelovigen in|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5091/Religie/article/detail/3830831/2015/01/16/Ongelovigen-halen-de-gelovigen-in.dhtml|access-date=21 April 2015|work=Dossier Relige|publisher=der Verdieping Trouw|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a vast majority of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church of any kind. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006.&lt;ref name="BerntsA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernts|first1=Tom|last2=Berghuijs|first2=Joantine|title=God in Nederland 1966–2015|date=2016|publisher=Ten Have|isbn=9789025905248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006, 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual; in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.&lt;ref name="nos.nl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hoe God (bijna) verdween uit Nederland|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2092498-hoe-god-bijna-verdween-uit-nederland.html|access-date=3 April 2016|publisher=NOS|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in the Netherlands|Universities in the Netherlands}}
[[File:BSN Junior School Vlaskamp.jpg|thumb|left|An international primary school in The Hague]]
[[File:Utrecht-Uithof, from CambridgeLaan 01.jpg|thumb|left|View on the Utrecht Science Park of [[Utrecht University]]. The building in the centre is the library.]]
Education in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16. If a child does not have a "starting qualification" (HAVO, VWO or MBO 2+ degree) they are still forced to attend classes until they achieve such a qualification or reach the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/leerplicht/leerplicht-en-kwalificatieplicht|title=Leerplicht en kwalificatieplicht|website=Rijksoverheid.nl|access-date=9 June 2021|date=10 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All children in the Netherlands usually attend elementary school from (on average) ages 4 to 12. It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.

The [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has four grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the VMBO results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education that primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. An HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two-year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] programme.

Doctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students.

===Healthcare===
{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}

In 2016, the Netherlands maintained its number one position at the top of the annual [[Euro health consumer index]] (EHCI), which compares healthcare systems in Europe, scoring 916 of a maximum 1,000 points. The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse|work=healthpowerhouse.com|access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the [[health care system]]s of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65M0SU20100623 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. scores dead last again in healthcare study | date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110040524/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences In Seven Countries, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse – Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:
* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called "basic insurance", covers common medical care.
* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.

While Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.

Healthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.&lt;ref name="Boot"&gt;J.M. Boot, 'De Nederlandse Gezondheidszorg', Bohn Stafleu van Loghum 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most cost-effective.&lt;ref name=BCG&gt;Boston Consulting Group, 'Zorg voor Waarde', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' ("General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.&lt;ref name="statline.cbs.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=71914ned&amp;D1=37-43&amp;D2=a&amp;HDR=G1&amp;STB=T&amp;VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=nl|access-date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.&lt;ref name="minvws.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minvws.nl/en/themes/health-insurance-system/|title=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport|first=Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en|last=Sport|work=minvws.nl|access-date=26 August 2016|date=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.&lt;ref name="statline.cbs.nl"/&gt;

Other sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).&lt;ref name="statline.cbs.nl"/&gt; Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums.

A key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about €100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and €150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of €220 (US$288).

There are large bicycle parking facilities, particularly in city centres and at train stations.

=== Water transport ===
Until the introduction of trains, ships were the primary mode of transport in the Netherlands. And shipping has remained crucial afterwards. The [[Port of Rotterdam]] is the largest port in Europe and the largest port in the world outside East-Asia, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the [[hinterland]] upstream reaching to [[Basel]], Switzerland, and into Germany and France. {{As of|2013}}, Rotterdam was the world's eighth largest [[container port]] handling 440.5 million metric tonnes of cargo annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/Port/port-statistics/Documents/Port-statistics-2013/index.html#8 |title=Port of Rotterdam Statistics 2013 |publisher=Port of Rotterdam |access-date=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port's main activities are [[petrochemical]] industries and general cargo handling and [[transshipment]]. The harbour functions as an important transit point for [[bulk material handling|bulk materials]] and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. The Volkeraksluizen between Rotterdam and Antwerp are the biggest sluices for inland navigation in the world in terms of tonnage passing through them. In 2007, the [[Betuweroute]], a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed. The Netherlands also hosts Europe's 4th largest port in [[Port of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]].

The Netherlands has had many well-known painters. 
In the Middle Ages [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Petrus Christus]], [[Lucas Gassel]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were leading Dutch pioneers.

During the [[Dutch Golden Age]], spanning much of the 17th century, the Dutch Republic was prosperous and witnessed a flourishing artistic movement. This was the age of the "Dutch Masters", such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], [[Gerard van Honthorst]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]] and many others.

Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were [[Vincent van Gogh]] and the luminists [[Jan Sluijters]], [[Leo Gestel]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. [[M. C. Escher]] is a well-known graphic artist. [[Willem de Kooning]] was born and trained in [[Rotterdam]], although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist.

Literature flourished as well during the Dutch Golden Age, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.

Various architectural styles can be distinguished in the Netherlands. Over the years, various styles have been built and preserved.

The [[Romanesque architecture]] was built between the years 950 and 1250. 
This architectural style is most concentrated in the provinces of [[Gelderland]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. Limburg, in particular, differs greatly in architectural style from the rest of the Netherlands.

The [[Gothic architecture]] came to in the Netherlands from about 1230. Gothic buildings often had large windows, pointed arches and were richly decorated.
[[Brabantine Gothic]] originated with the rise of the Duchy of Brabant and spread throughout the Burgundian provinces.
This architectural style is most concentrated in the province of [[North Brabant]], such as [[St. John's Cathedral ('s-Hertogenbosch)|St. John's Cathedral]] in [['s-Hertogenbosch]], The [[Grote kerk (Breda)|Church of Our Lady]] in [[Breda]] and the [[Margraves Palace]] in [[Bergen op Zoom]].

What many know as traditional Dutch architecture is the [[Dutch Baroque architecture]] (1525 – 1630) and classicism (1630 – 1700).
These style of architecture is especially in evidence in the cities of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].

Other architectural styles that are common in the Netherlands are [[Style Louis XIV]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]], [[Neoclassicism]]
[[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], [[De Stijl]], [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|Traditionalism]] and [[Brutalism]].

The Netherlands is the country of philosophers [[Erasmus]], [[Rudolf Agricola]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. Much of [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' major work was done in the Netherlands, where he studied at [[Leiden University]] — as did geologist [[James Hutton]], British Prime Minister [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart]], U.S. President [[John Quincy Adams]], Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].

Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.

===Southern Netherlands===
[[File:Carnaval 2013 Netherlands.jpg|thumb|Carnival in [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]]]
In the south of the Netherlands there are some festivals that rarely or never occur in the rest of the Netherlands. 
These celebrations grew out of Catholic traditions, including [[Carnival in the Netherlands|Carnival]], lantern parades during the celebration of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Three Kings]], Brabantian Day and huge [[Bloemencorso]]. Bloemencorsos used to occur in many places in the Netherlands, but in the 21th century, [[Zundert]] and [[Valkenswaard]] in [[North Brabant]] have taken the lead.

===Dutch value system===
{{Main|Dutch customs and etiquette}}
Dutch society is [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[Modernism|modern]]. The Dutch have an aversion to the non-essential.&lt;ref name="Colin White 1995"/&gt; Ostentatious behaviour is to be avoided. The Dutch are proud of their [[cultural heritage]], [[Dutch art|rich history in art]] and involvement in [[International relations|international affairs]].&lt;ref name="Colin White 1995"/&gt;

[[File:Koningsdag 2017 Amstel.jpg|thumb|left|Dutch people in orange celebrating [[Koningsdag|King's Day]] in Amsterdam, 2017]]
Dutch manners are open and direct with a no-nonsense attitude—informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, "Their directness gives many the impression that they are rude and crude—attributes they prefer to call openness."&lt;ref name="Colin White 1995"&gt;Colin White &amp; Laurie Boucke (1995). The UnDutchables: An observation of the Netherlands, its culture and its inhabitants (3rd Ed.). White-Boucke Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is "Dealing with the Dutch" by Jacob Vossestein: "Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status."&lt;ref&gt;J. Vossenstein, Dealing with the Dutch, 9789460220791.&lt;/ref&gt; As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. "What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather."&lt;ref name="Colin White 1995"/&gt;

The Netherlands is one of the most secular countries of Europe, and religion in the Netherlands is generally considered as a personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public, although it often remains a discussion subject. For only 17% of the population religion is important and 14% goes to church weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker, De Hart|first1=Jos, Joep|title=Godsdienstige veranderingen in Nederland, Verschuivingen in de binding met de kerken en de christelijke traditie|url=http://www.scp.nl/dsresource?objectid=6e36ffc5-45eb-4b33-bc88-eb7b99083527|website=SCP|publisher=Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau Den Haag|access-date=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010141120/https://www.scp.nl/dsresource?objectid=6e36ffc5-45eb-4b33-bc88-eb7b99083527|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]]. On 1 April 2001, the Netherlands became the first nation to legalise [[same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0104/01/sm.10.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage Legalized in Amsterdam|date=1 April 2001|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=11 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221411/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0104/01/sm.10.html|archive-date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch people and ecology===
As of 2018 the Netherlands had one of the highest rates of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions per capita in the European Union, above those of Germany, France and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/fossil-co2-emissions-all-world-countries-2018-report |date=2018 |title=Fossil CO2 emissions of all world countries – 2018 Report |work=EU Science Hub |access-date=21 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Dutch waste more food than any other EU citizen, at over three times the EU average &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20170505STO73528/food-waste-the-problem-in-the-eu-in-numbers-infographic|date=2017|title=Food waste: the problem in the EU in numbers|work=EU parliament|access-date=18 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the Netherlands has nonetheless the [[reputation]] of the [[Leadership|leader]] [[country]] in [[environmental science|environmental]] and [[Management|population management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamexpat.nl/read-and-discuss/expat-page/news/amsterdam-and-rotterdam-among-worlds-most-sustainable-cities-2015|title=IAMEXPAT News|website=Iamexpat.nl|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Amsterdam and Rotterdam were ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, on the [[Arcadis NV|Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arcadis-whitepaper/arcadis-sustainable-cities-index-report.pdf|title=Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index Report|date=2015|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecitiesindex.com/|title=Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index|website=Sustainablecitiesindex.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainability]] is a concept important for the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The goal of the Dutch Government is to have a [[Sustainability|sustainable]], reliable and affordable energy system, by 2050, in which [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|{{CO2}} emissions]] have been halved and 40 per cent of [[electricity]] is derived from [[Sustainability|sustainable sources]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.rvo.nl/topics/sustainability|title=Sustainable enterprise {{!}} RVO.nl|website=english.rvo.nl|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government]] is investing billions of euros in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[sustainable energy]] and [[Carbon dioxide|{{CO2}} reduction]]. The Kingdom also encourages Dutch [[companies]] to build [[sustainable business]]/[[project]]s/[[Facility management|facilities]], with [[Subsidy|financial aids]] from the state to the companies or [[individual]]s who are active in making the [[country]] more [[Sustainability|sustainable]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Music===

[[File:Anouk, ESC2013 press conference 09 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|left|Pop singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] in 2013]]
The Netherlands has multiple [[music]] traditions. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as "[[Levenslied]]", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of verses and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and [[André Hazes]].

Contemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.

[[File:Coldplay perform "Up&amp;Up", Amsterdam Arena, June 2016 (5).jpg|thumb|[[Johan Cruyff Arena]], the largest Dutch concert venue]]
Current [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[ReVamp]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]], [[Asrai]], [[Autumn]], [[Ayreon]] and [[Within Temptation]] as well as [[jazz]] and pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having international success. Also, metal bands like [[Hail of Bullets]], [[God Dethroned]], [[Izegrim]], [[Asphyx]], [[Textures (band)|Textures]], [[Present Danger]], [[Heidevolk]] and [[Slechtvalk]] are popular guests at the biggest [[metal festival]]s in Europe. Contemporary local stars include pop singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]], country pop singer [[Ilse DeLange]], [[South Guelderish]] and [[Limburgish]] dialect singing folk band [[Rowwen Hèze]], rock band [[BLØF]] and duo [[Nick &amp; Simon]]. [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]], one of the country's most well known and versatile singers, has made multiple albums with famous American composers [[Vince Mendoza]] and [[Burt Bacharach]].

Early 1990s Dutch and [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[house music]] came together in [[Eurodance]] project [[2 Unlimited]]. Selling 18 million records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/2-unlimited-mn0000431439/biography |title=2 Unlimited &amp;#124; Biography &amp;#124; AllMusic |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day. Tracks like "[[Get Ready for This]]" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the [[NHL]]. In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre.

Since the 1990s, Dutch [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]]. Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Tiësto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dash Berlin]], [[Julian Jordan]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[W&amp;W]], [[Don Diablo]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]]. The [[Amsterdam Dance Event]] (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local-life.com/amsterdam/articles/amsterdam-dance-event|title=Amsterdam Dance Event|work=local-life.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchdailynews.com/the-international-dance-industry-assembles-in-amsterdam-next-week/|title=The international Dance industry assembles in Amsterdam next week|work=Dutch Daily News|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These DJs also contribute to the world's mainstream pop music, as they frequently collaborate and produce for high-profile international artists.

The Netherlands have [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|participated]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] since its first edition in 1956, and have won five times. Their most recent win was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]].

In [[classical music]], [[Jan Sweelinck]] ranks as the Dutch most famous composer, with [[Louis Andriessen]] amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. [[Ton Koopman]] is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are [[Janine Jansen]] and [[André Rieu]]. The latter, together with his [[Johann Strauss Orchestra]], has taken classical and [[waltz (music)|waltz music]] on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts. The most famous Dutch classical composition is "[[Canto Ostinato]]" by [[Simeon ten Holt]], a minimalistic composition for multiple instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canto-ostinato.com/canto/index.html|title=Canto Ostinato by Simeon ten Holt|website=www.canto-ostinato.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.andrerieu.com/tag/international/page/2/|title=international Archives » Page 2 of 3 » Andre Rieu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266418/top-25-tours-of-2009|title=Top 25 Tours of 2009|date=11 December 2009|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acclaimed harpist [[Lavinia Meijer]] in 2012 released an album with works from [[Philip Glass]] that she transcribed for harp, with approval of Glass himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/philip-glass-metamorphosis-the-hours-mw0002435025 Lavinia Meijer – Philip Glass : Metamorphosis &amp; The Hours], Allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Concertgebouw]] (completed in 1888) in Amsterdam is home to the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]], considered one of the world's finest orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97291390|title=Chicago Symphony Tops U.S. Orchestras|date=21 November 2008|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Voice Of .jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[The Voice (TV series)|''The Voice'' franchise]] originated in the Netherlands.]] --&gt;

Some Dutch films – mainly by director [[Paul Verhoeven]] – have received international distribution and recognition, such as ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' ("''Turks Fruit''", 1973), ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' ("''Soldaat van Oranje''", 1977), ''[[Spetters]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' ("''De Vierde Man''", 1983). Verhoeven then went on to direct big [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movies like ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), and returned with Dutch film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' ("''Zwartboek''", 2006).

Other well-known Dutch film directors are [[Jan de Bont]] (''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''), [[Anton Corbijn]] (''[[A Most Wanted Man (film)|A Most wanted Man]]''), [[Dick Maas]] (''[[De Lift]]''), [[Fons Rademakers]] (''[[The Assault (1986 film)|The Assault]]''), and documentary makers [[Bert Haanstra]] and [[Joris Ivens]]. Film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] achieved international notoriety in 2004 when he was murdered by [[Mohammed Bouyeri]] in the streets of Amsterdam after directing the short film ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]''.

Internationally, successful directors of photography from the Netherlands are [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] (''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'') and [[Theo van de Sande]] (''[[Wayne's World]]'' and ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]''). Van Hoytema went to the [[National Film School in Łódź]] ([[Poland]]) and Van de Sande went to the [[Netherlands Film Academy]]. Internationally successful Dutch actors include [[Famke Janssen]] ([[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'']]), [[Carice van Houten]] (''[[Game of Thrones]]''), [[Michiel Huisman]] (''[[Game of Thrones]]''), [[Rutger Hauer]] (''[[Blade Runner]]''), [[Jeroen Krabbé]] (''[[The Living Daylights]]'') and [[Derek de Lint]] (''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'').

The Netherlands has a well developed television market, with both multiple commercial and public broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound and subtitled. Only foreign shows for children are dubbed.&lt;ref name="HaGanahl2013"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=chXSFH-gzVMC&amp;pg=PA101 Webcasting Worldwide: Business Models of an Emerging Global Medium]''.

TV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate [[Endemol]], founded by Dutch [[Mass media|media]] [[Business magnate|tycoons]] [[John de Mol Jr.|John de Mol]] and [[Joop van den Ende]]. Headquartered in [[Amsterdam]], Endemol has around 90 companies in over 30 countries. Endemol and its subsidiaries create and run reality, talent, and game show franchises worldwide, including ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' and ''[[Deal or No Deal]]''. John de Mol later started his own company [[Tien (TV channel)|Talpa]] which created show franchises like [[The Voice (TV series)|''The Voice'']] and ''[[Utopia (U.S. reality TV series)|Utopia]]''.

Organisation of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch [[K-1]] [[Kickboxing|kickboxers]] have won the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] 15 times out of 19 tournaments. The [[Netherlands women's national handball team|Netherlands Women's handball team]] holds the record of the only team in the world that consecutively reached all six semifinals of major international tournaments since 2015, winning silver and bronze at the [[European Women's Handball Championship]] and silver, bronze and gold at the [[World Women's Handball Championship]]. They finished fourth at the [[Handball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Summer Olympics]].

The Dutch [[Speed skating|speed skaters']] performance at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the [[TT Circuit Assen]] has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.

The Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with [[Jan Janssen]] winning the [[1968 Tour de France]], more recently with [[Tom Dumoulin]] winning the [[2017 Giro d'Italia]] and legendary rider [[Joop Zoetemelk]] was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]], the [[1980 Tour de France]] and still holds or shares numerous [[Tour de France]] records including most Tours finished and most kilometres ridden.

Limburger [[Max Verstappen]] currently races in [[Formula One]], and [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix]]. The coastal resort of [[Circuit Zandvoort|Zandvoort]] hosted the [[Dutch Grand Prix]] from 1958 to 1985, and has been announced to return in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/zandvoort-secures-return-dutch-gp/4388156/|title=Zandvoort secures F1 return as Dutch GP venue|date=14 May 2019|website=motorsports.com|access-date=19 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|volleyball national men's team]] has also been successful, winning the silver medal at the [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] and the gold medal [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|four years later]] in [[Atlanta]]. The biggest success of the [[Netherlands women's national volleyball team|women's national team]] was winning the [[1995 Women's European Volleyball Championship|European Championship in 1995]] and the [[2007 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|World Grand Prix in 2007]].

Recently [[cricket]] has made a remarkable progress in the Netherlands. Netherlands have participated in 1996, 2003, 2007 and 2011 ODI cricket World Cup. They have also qualified for 2009 and 2014 T20 World Cup. In the 2009 T20 World Cup, Netherlands defeated England, the current World Champions and inventor of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/june-5-2009-netherlands-stun-england-in-t20-world-cup-thriller-2654425.html|title=Netherlands Stun England in T20 World Cup Thriller|publisher=News18|date=5 June 2009|access-date=6 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryan ten Doeschate]] is the only Dutch player to have played in the [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] on the team [[Kolkata Knight Riders]].

Originally, the country's cuisine was shaped by the practices of [[fishing]] and [[farming]], including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals. Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.

Modern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or containing small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske dúmkes|Fryske dúmkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savoury pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. A notable characteristic of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.

The provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century been known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd – Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavoured spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.

The Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.

In early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |access-date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Good Enough to Eat – Media Briefing |url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |date=14 January 2013 |access-date=1 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808001149/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |archive-date=8 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the exploitations in the [[Mughal Empire]] in the 17th century, to the [[New Imperialism|colonisations]] in the 19th century, [[Dutch Empire|Dutch imperial possessions]] continued to expand, reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hart, Jonathan |title=Empires and Colonies |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LnevC1FYdnEC&amp;pg=PA201 |access-date=21 August 2012 |year=2008|publisher=Polity |isbn=978-0-7456-2614-7 |pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]] of the 17th century, the Netherlands urbanised considerably, mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies. Social status was based on merchants' income, which reduced [[feudalism]] and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society. When the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch royal family]] was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.&lt;ref&gt;To this day the Dutch Royal family is in fact the wealthiest family of the Netherlands. One of the foundations of its wealth was the colonial trade.{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/30/worlds-richest-royals-biz-royals07-cx_lk_0830royalintro_slide_15.html?thisSpeed=30000 |title=In Pictures: The World's Richest Royals |work=Forbes |date=30 August 2007 |access-date=5 March 2010 |first1=Devon |last1=Pendleton |first2=Tatiana |last2=Serafin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company established their base in parts of [[Ceylon]] (modern-day [[Sri Lanka]]). Afterward, they established ports in [[Dutch Malabar|Dutch occupied Malabar]], leading to [[Dutch India|Dutch settlements and trading posts in India]]. However, their expansion into [[India]] was halted, after their defeat in the [[Battle of Colachel]] by the [[Travancore|Kingdom of Travancore]], during the [[Travancore-Dutch War]]. The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to [[Bengal Subah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M.

Universities such as the [[Leiden University]], founded in the 16th century, have developed into leading knowledge centres for [[Southeast Asia]]n and Indonesian studies.{{efn|Some of the university faculties still include: Indonesian Languages and Cultures; South-east Asia and Oceania Languages and Cultures; Cultural Anthropology.}} Leiden University has produced leading academics such as [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]], and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures. Leiden University and in particular [[KITLV]] are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies. Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam [[Tropenmuseum]], an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art, culture, ethnography and anthropology.

The traditions of the [[Royal Dutch East Indies Army]] (KNIL) are maintained by the [[Regiment Van Heutsz]] of the modern [[Royal Netherlands Army]]. A dedicated ''[[Bronbeek]] Museum'', a former home for retired KNIL soldiers, exists in [[Arnhem]] to this day.

A specific segment of Dutch literature called [[Dutch Indies literature]] still exists and includes established authors, such as [[Louis Couperus]], the writer of "The Hidden Force", taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuys, Rob ''Mirror of the Indies: A History of Dutch Colonial Literature'' translated from Dutch by E. M. Beekman (Publisher: Periplus, 1999) [http://dannyreviews.com/h/Mirror_Indies.html Book review.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the great masterpieces of [[Dutch literature]] is the book "[[Max Havelaar]]", written by [[Multatuli]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Etty, Elsbeth (July 1998).

The majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian), native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies. This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community.&lt;ref&gt;Bosma U., Raben R.

Including their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands. In 2008, the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/bevolking/cijfers/default.htm Official CBS website containing all Dutch demographic statistics].

Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands. [[Rijsttafel]], a colonial culinary concept, and dishes such as [[Nasi goreng]] and [[satay]] are very popular in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dutchfood.about.com/od/mainmeals/Main_Meals.htm |title=Dutch Food – Main Meals |publisher=about.com |access-date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practically any town of any size in the Netherlands has a "toko" (a Dutch Indonesian Shop) or a Chinese-Indonesian restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://indisch-eten.startpagina.nl/ Overview website (incomplete)].
