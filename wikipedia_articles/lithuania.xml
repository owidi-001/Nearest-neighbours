In this way, France appears as 'presidentialist system' endowed with a 'semi-presidential regime' (1983: 587).

Lithuania covers an area of {{convert|65300|km2|sqmi|abbr= on}}, with a population of 2.8 million. Its capital and largest city is [[Vilnius]]; other major cities are [[Kaunas]] and [[Klaipėda]]. [[Lithuanians]] belong to the ethno-linguistic group of the [[Balts]] and speak [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], one of only a few living [[Baltic languages]].

For millenia the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various [[Balts|Baltic tribes]]. In the 1230s, Lithuanian lands were united by [[Mindaugas]], founding the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] on 6 July 1253. In the 14th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was the largest country in Europe;&lt;ref name="Bideleux"/&gt; present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were all lands of the Grand Duchy. With the [[Union of Lublin]] of 1569, Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state [[personal union]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries [[Partitions of Poland|dismantled]] it in 1772–1795, with the [[Russian Empire]] annexing most of Lithuania's territory. As [[World War I]] ended, Lithuania's [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Act of Independence]] was signed on 16 February 1918, founding the modern Republic of Lithuania. In [[World War II]], Lithuania was occupied [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|first by the Soviet Union]] and [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|then by Nazi Germany]]. Towards the end of the war in 1944, when the Germans were retreating, the Soviet Union [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|reoccupied Lithuania]]. [[Lithuanian partisans|Lithuanian armed resistance]] to the Soviet occupation lasted until the early 1950s. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Lithuania passed the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]], becoming the first Soviet republic to proclaim its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Lithuania breaks away from the Soviet Union |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1990/mar/12/eu.politics |website=[[The Guardian]] |quote=Lithuania last night became the first republic to break away from the Soviet Union, by proclaiming the restoration of its pre-war independence. The newly-elected parliament, 'reflecting the people's will,' decreed the restoration of 'the sovereign rights of the Lithuanian state, infringed by alien forces in 1940,' and declared that from that moment Lithuania was again an independent state |location=London |date=12 March 1990 |access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania is a [[developed country]], with a [[World Bank high-income economy|high income]] [[Economy of Lithuania|advanced economy]]; ranking very high in the [[Human Development Index]]. It ranks favourably in terms of [[Freedom in the World (report)|civil liberties]], [[Press Freedom Index|press freedom]] and [[Internet censorship and surveillance by country|internet freedom]]. However, Lithuania has experienced a gradual [[population decline]] since the 1990s, with social issues such as income inequality and high [[Suicide in Lithuania|suicide]] rate remaining a problem. Lithuania is a member of the [[European Union]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[eurozone]], the [[Nordic Investment Bank]], [[Schengen Agreement]], [[NATO]] and [[OECD]]. It participates in the [[NB8|Nordic-Baltic Eight]] (NB8) regional co-operation format.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Lithuania}}
[[File:Lietuvos vardas. The first name of Lithuania in writing 1009.jpg|thumb|left|Lithuania's name in writing, 1009]]
The first known record of the name of Lithuania ({{lang-lt|Lietuva}}) is in a 9 March 1009 story of [[Bruno of Querfurt|Saint Bruno]] in the [[Quedlinburg Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Origin of the Name of Lithuania | journal=Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=Fall 2009 | first=Tomas | last=Baranauskas | issn=0024-5089}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva: ''Litua''&lt;ref&gt;Vilnius. [http://www.vilnius-tourism.lt/index.php/en/39453/ Key dates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117201537/http://www.vilnius-tourism.lt/index.php/en/39453/ |date=17 January 2007 }}. Retrieved on 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced {{IPA|[litua]}}). Due to the lack of reliable evidence, the true meaning of the name is unknown. Nowadays, scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions.&lt;ref name="VardasVle"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zinkevičius |first1=Zigmas |authorlink1=Zigmas Zinkevičius |title=Lietuvos vardas |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-vardas/ |website=[[Vle.lt]] |access-date=12 July 2021 |language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Lietuva'' has a suffix (-''uva''), the original word should have no suffix.&lt;ref name="VardasVle"/&gt; A likely candidate is ''Lietā''. Because many [[Baltic language|Baltic]] [[ethnonym]]s originated from [[hydronym]]s, linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms. Usually, such names evolved through the following process: hydronym → toponym → [[ethnonym]].&lt;ref name=Zigmas2&gt;Zigmas Zinkevičius. Kelios mintys, kurios kyla skaitant Alfredo Bumblausko Senosios Lietuvos istoriją 1009-1795m. Voruta, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lietava River|Lietava]], a small river not far from [[Kernavė]], the core area of the [[Duchy of Lithuania|early Lithuanian state]] and a possible first capital of the eventual [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], is usually credited as the source of the name.&lt;ref name=Zigmas2/&gt; However, the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation. On the other hand, such naming is not unprecedented in world history.&lt;ref name=Zigmas&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zigmas |last=Zinkevičius |url=http://www.voruta.lt/archyvas/74/253 |title=Lietuvos vardo kilmė |journal=Voruta |issn=1392-0677 |date=30 November 1999 |volume=3 |issue=669 |language=lt}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baltic-amber-colours.JPG|thumb|right|[[Baltic Amber]] was once a valuable trade resource. It was transported from the region of modern-day Lithuania to the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Egypt]] through the [[Amber Road]].]]
The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the [[last glacial period]] in the 10th millennium BC: [[Kunda culture|Kunda]], [[Neman culture|Neman]] and [[Narva culture]]s.&lt;ref name="PoloméWinter2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edgar C.

In the 8th millennium BC, the climate became much warmer, and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania then travelled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and fresh-water fishing. Agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium BC due to a harsh climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land. Crafts and trade also started to form at this time. Over a millennium, the [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeans]], who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium BC, mixed with the local population and formed various [[Baltic tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Šapoka|first1=Adolfas|title=Lietuvos istorija|date=1936|publisher=[[Šviesa]]|location=Kaunas|pages=13–17|url=http://www.partizanai.org/failai/pdf/sapokos-istorija.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tacitus]], in his study ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', described the [[Aesti]] people, inhabitants of the south-eastern [[Baltic Sea]] shores who were probably Balts, around the year 97 AD. The Western Balts differentiated and became known to outside chroniclers first. [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD knew of the [[Galindians]] and [[Yotvingians]], and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] chroniclers mentioned [[Old Prussians]], [[Curonians]] and [[Semigallians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alfonsas |last1=Eidintas |first2=Alfredas |last2=Bumblauskas |first3=Antanas |last3=Kulakauskas |first4=Mindaugas |last4=Tamošaitis |title=The History of Lithuania |year=2013 |url=http://static.eu2013.lt/uploads/documents/Liet_istorija_knygos/EN_lt.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215231241/http://static.eu2013.lt/uploads/documents/Liet_istorija_knygos/EN_lt.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 December 2013 |publisher=Eugrimas |isbn=978-609-437-204-9 |pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lithuanian language]] is considered to be very [[Conservative (language)|conservative]] for its close connection to Indo-European roots. It is believed to have differentiated from the [[Latvian language]], the most closely related existing language, around the 7th century.&lt;ref name="Bumblauskas 13"&gt;Eidintas et al.

From the late 12th century, an organized Lithuanian military force existed; it was used for external raids, plundering and the gathering of slaves.

After two civil wars, [[Vytautas the Great]] became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1392. During his reign, Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion, centralization of the state began, and the [[Lithuanian nobility]] became increasingly prominent in state politics. In the great [[Battle of the Vorskla River]] in 1399, the combined forces of [[Tokhtamysh]] and Vytautas were defeated by the [[Golden Horde|Mongols]].

After the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobility attempted to break the union between [[Poland]] and Lithuania, independently selecting Grand Dukes from the [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. But, at the end of the 15th century, Lithuania was forced to seek a closer alliance with Poland when the growing power of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] threatened Lithuania's Russian principalities and sparked the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]] and the [[Livonian War]].

The Livonian War was ceased for ten years with a [[Truce of Yam-Zapolsky]] signed on 15 January 1582 according to which the already [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] recovered [[Livonia]], [[Polotsk]] and [[Velizh]], but transferred [[Velikiye Luki]] to the [[Tsardom of Russia]].

The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was created in 1569 by the Union of Lublin. As a member of the Commonwealth, Lithuania retained its institutions, including a separate army, currency, and statutory laws – [[Statutes of Lithuania|the Statute of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Daniel. ''The Polish–Lithuanian State: 1386–1795''. University of Washington Press, 2001. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Polonization]] affected all aspects of Lithuanian life: politics, language, culture, and national identity. From the mid-16th to the mid-17th centuries, culture, arts, and education flourished, fueled by the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. From 1573, the Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania were [[free election (Polish throne)|elected by the nobility]], who were granted ever-increasing [[Golden Liberty|Golden Liberties]]. These liberties, especially the ''[[liberum veto]]'', led to anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state.

[[File:Kirholm 1605 I.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Kircholm]], 1605]]
The Commonwealth reached its [[Polish Golden Age|Golden Age]] in the early 17th century. Its powerful [[Sejm|parliament]] was dominated by nobles who were reluctant to get involved in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; this neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of contemporary Europe. The Commonwealth held its own against [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the [[Tsardom of Russia]], and vassals of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and even launched successful [[expansionism|expansionist]] offensives against its neighbours. In [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|several invasions]] during the [[Time of Troubles]], Commonwealth troops entered Russia and managed to take [[Moscow]] and hold it from 27 September 1610 to 4 November 1612, when they were driven out [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)#The war resumes (1611)|after a siege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos aukso amžius – vienas sprendimas galėjo pakeisti visą istoriją|url=https://www.delfi.lt/multimedija/musu-lietuva/lietuvos-aukso-amzius-vienas-sprendimas-galejo-pakeisti-visa-istorija.d?id=74961334|website=DELFI|access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian occupation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lasted up to 1661. Many artefacts and cultural heritage were either lost or looted, significant parts of the state archive – [[Lithuanian Metrica]], collected since the 13th century, were lost and the rest was moved out of the country. During the [[Second Northern War|Northern Wars]] (1655–1661), the Lithuanian territory and economy were devastated by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army. Almost all territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was occupied by Swedish and Russian armies. This period is known as ''Tvanas'' ([[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]]).

Before it could fully recover, Lithuania was ravaged during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721). The war, [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague]], and [[Great Frost of 1709|a famine]] caused the deaths of approximately 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume= 16 |issue=2 |year= 2008 |url=http://www.liw.lt/archive_vid.php?shid=1211283347&amp;id=1211283055 |title=The Roads to Independence |journal=Lithuania in the World |issn=1392-0901 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512014106/http://www.liw.lt/archive_vid.php?shid=1211283347&amp;id=1211283055 |archive-date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign powers, especially Russia, became dominant in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Konstitucija1791"/&gt; Numerous fractions among the nobility used the Golden Liberties to prevent any reforms.&lt;ref name="Konstitucija1791"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]] was adopted by the [[Great Sejm]] (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth trying to save the state. The legislation was designed to redress the Commonwealth's political defects due to the system of Golden Liberties, also known as the "Nobles' Democracy," which had conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility (Szlachta) and over time had corrupted politics. The constitution sought to supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]] with a more democratic [[constitutional monarchy]]. It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. It banned parliamentary institutions such as the ''liberum veto'', which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. It was drafted in relation to a copy of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of May 3, 1791|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pdf/konstitucija_angliska_1.pdf|website=LRS.lt|access-date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1791 m. gegužės 3 d.

[[File:Valancius.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]] resisted Russification. He urged protest against the closing of Catholic churches and organised book printing in Lithuanian in [[Lithuania Minor]]]]
Eventually, [[Partitions of Poland|the Commonwealth was partitioned]] in 1772, 1792, and 1795 by the [[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]], and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

The largest area of Lithuanian territory became part of the Russian Empire. After the unsuccessful [[November Uprising|uprisings in 1831]] and [[January Uprising|1863]], the Tsarist authorities implemented a number of [[Russification]] policies. In 1840 the [[Statutes of Lithuania#Third Statute|Third Statute of Lithuania]] was abolished. They [[Lithuanian press ban|banned the Lithuanian press]], closed cultural and educational institutions and made Lithuania part of a new administrative region called [[Northwestern Krai]]. The Russification failed, owing to an extensive network of [[Lithuanian book smugglers]] and secret Lithuanian homeschooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=XX a. pradžioje rusus suerzino paviešinti lietuvių knygnešystės mastai |url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/tavo-lrt/15/22153/xx-a-pradzioje-rusus-suerzino-paviesinti-lietuviu-knygnesystes-mastai |website=[[Lrt.lt]] |access-date=29 July 2013 |language=lt |date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], when German diplomats assigned what were seen as Russian spoils of war to Turkey, the relationship between Russia and the [[German Empire]] became complicated. The Russian Empire resumed the construction of fortresses at its western borders for defence against a potential invasion from Germany in the West. On 7 July 1879 the [[Alexander II of Russia|Russian Emperor Alexander II]] approved a proposal from the Russian military leadership to build the largest "first-class" defensive structure in the entire state – the {{convert|65|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} [[Kaunas Fortress]].&lt;ref name="Kauno tvirtovė"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kauno tvirtovės istorija |publisher=Gintaras Česonis |url=http://tvirtove.kaunas.lt/ |year=2004 |access-date=12 June 2008 |language=lt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510074436/http://tvirtove.kaunas.lt/ |archive-date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of Lithuanians went to the United States in 1867–1868 after a [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lithuanians in the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simonas Daukantas]] promoted a return to Lithuania's pre-[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] traditions, which he depicted as a Golden Age of Lithuania and a renewal of the native culture, based on the [[Lithuanian language]] and customs. With those ideas in mind, he wrote already in 1822 a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian – ''Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių'' (''The Deeds of Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians''), though it was not published at that time. A colleague of S. Daukantas, [[Teodor Narbutt]] wrote in Polish a voluminous ''Ancient History of the Lithuanian Nation'' (1835–1841), where he likewise expounded and expanded further on the concept of historic Lithuania, whose days of glory had ended with the Union of Lublin in 1569. Narbutt, invoking German scholarship, pointed out the relationship between the Lithuanian and [[Sanskrit]] languages. A [[Lithuanian National Revival]], inspired by the ancient Lithuanian history, language and culture, laid the foundations of the modern Lithuanian nation and independent Lithuania.

[[File:Signatarai.Signatories of Lithuania.jpg|thumb|The original 20 members of the [[Council of Lithuania]] after signing the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]], 16 February 1918.]]

On 18–22 September 1917, the [[Vilnius Conference]] elected the 20-member [[Council of Lithuania]]. The council adopted the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]] on 16 February 1918 which proclaimed the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania governed by democratic principles, with [[Vilnius]] as its capital. The state of Lithuania which had been built within the framework of the Act lasted from 1918 until 1940.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the first Provisional [[Constitution of Lithuania]] was adopted and the first government of Prime Minister [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was organized. At the same time, the army and other state institutions began to be organized. Lithuania fought [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence|three wars of independence]]: [[Lithuanian–Soviet War|against the Bolsheviks]] who proclaimed the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–1919)|Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]], against the [[West Russian Volunteer Army|Bermontians]], and [[Polish–Lithuanian War|against Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirmosios Lietuvos nepriklausomybės kovos|url=http://www.partizanai.org/index.php/karys-4-5-1951m/4055-pirmosios-lietuvos-nepriklausomybes-kovos|website=Partizanai.org|access-date=23 December 2017|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lesčius|first1=Vytautas|title=Lietuvos kariuomenė nepriklausomybės kovose 1918–1920.

In January 1923, Lithuania staged the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] and captured [[Klaipėda Region]] (Memel territory) which was detached from [[East Prussia]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The region became an autonomous region of Lithuania.

On 15 May 1920, the first meeting of the democratically elected [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania|constituent assembly]] took place. The documents it adopted, i. e. the temporary (1920) and permanent (1922) constitutions of Lithuania, strove to regulate the life of the new state. Land, finance, and educational reforms started to be implemented. The currency of Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian litas]], was introduced. The [[Vytautas Magnus University|University of Lithuania]] was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VMU Now and Before|url=http://www.vdu.lt/en/about-vmu/vmu-now-and-before/|website=[[Vytautas Magnus University]]|access-date=23 December 2017|date=10 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101656/http://www.vdu.lt/en/about-vmu/vmu-now-and-before/|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; All major public institutions had been established.

On 17 December 1926, a military [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état|coup d'état]] took place, resulting in the replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona. [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was appointed to form a government.

On 15 July 1933, [[Steponas Darius]] and [[Stasys Girėnas]], Lithuanian pilots, emigrants to the United States, made a significant flight in the [[Aviation history|history of world aviation]].

In terms of comparison, as far as the distance of non-stop flights was concerned, their result ranked second only to that of [[Russell Boardman]] and [[John Polando]].

The provisional capital Kaunas, which was nicknamed ''Little Paris'', and the country itself had a [[Western world|Western]] standard of living with sufficiently high salaries and low prices. At the time, qualified workers there were earning very similar [[real wages]] as workers in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]], the country also had a surprisingly high [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase in population]] of 9.7 and the [[industrial production]] of Lithuania increased by 160% from 1913 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodėl Kaunas buvo vadinamas mažuoju Paryžiumi?|url=https://kultura.lrytas.lt/istorija/kodel-kaunas-buvo-vadinamas-mazuoju-paryziumi.htm|website=lrytas.lt|access-date=3 January 2013|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lapinskas|first1=Anatolijus|title=Lietuva tarpukariu nebuvo atsilikėlė|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/lietuva-tarpukariu-nebuvo-atsilikele.d?id=61355765|website=[[DELFI]]|access-date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the retreat of the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]], the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1944)|Soviets reestablished their control of Lithuania]] in July–October 1944.

Under the pretext of Lithuania's economic recovery, the [[Moscow]] authorities encouraged the migration of workers and other specialists to Lithuania with the intention to further integrate Lithuania into the [[Soviet Union]] and to develop the country's industry. At the same time, Lithuanians were lured to work in the USSR by promising them all the privileges of settling in a new place.

The second Soviet occupation was accompanied by the [[Lithuanian partisans|guerrilla warfare]] of the Lithuanian population, which took place in 1944–1953. It sought to restore an independent state of Lithuania, to consolidate democracy by destroying communism in the country, returning national values and the freedom of religion. About 50,000 Lithuanians took to the forests and fought Soviet occupants with a gun in their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5379.htm |title=US Department of State Bureau of Public Affairs|website=State.gov |date=August 2006 |access-date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partizanai.org/failai/html/fighters-for-freedom.htm|title=Fighters for Freedom.

Even with the suppression of partisan resistance, the Soviet government failed to stop the movement for the independence of Lithuania. The underground dissident groups were active publishing the underground press and Catholic literature. The most active participants of the movement included [[Vincentas Sladkevičius]], [[Sigitas Tamkevičius]] and [[Nijolė Sadūnaitė]].

On 11 March 1990, the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council]] announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence. Lithuania became the first Soviet-occupied state to announce the restitution of independence. On 20 April 1990, the Soviets [[Soviet economic blockade of Lithuania|imposed an economic blockade]] by ceasing to deliver supplies of raw materials (primarily oil) to Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author1=Martha Brill Olcott |title=The Lithuanian Crisis |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1990-06-01/lithuanian-crisis |website=www.foreignaffairs.com |access-date=18 November 2018 |date=1990 |quote=For over two years Lithuania has been moving toward reclaiming its independence. This drive reached a crescendo on 11 March 1990, when the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania declared the republic no longer bound by Soviet law.

Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce the declaration of independence.

Gradually, economic relations had been restored. However, tensions had peaked again in January 1991. At that time, attempts were made to carry out a coup using the [[Soviet Armed Forces]], the Internal Army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the USSR Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]). Because of the poor economic situation in Lithuania, the forces in Moscow thought the [[coup d'état]] would receive strong public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 svarbiausių 1991–ųjų sausio įvykių, kuriuos privalote žinoti |url= https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/10-svarbiausiu-1991-uju-sausio-ivykiu-kuriuos-privalote-zinoti-56-565845 |website=15min.lt|access-date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Lithuania}}
[[File:LithuaniaPhysicalMap-en.png|thumb|right|350px|Physical map and geomorphological subdivision of Lithuania.]]

It has around {{convert|99|km|mi|1}} of sandy coastline, only about {{convert|38|km|mi|0}} of which face the open [[Baltic Sea]], less than the other two [[Baltic Sea countries]]. The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula. Lithuania's major [[warm-water port]], [[Klaipėda]], lies at the narrow mouth of the [[Curonian Lagoon]] (Lithuanian: ''Kuršių marios''), a shallow lagoon extending south to [[Kaliningrad]]. The country's main and largest river, the [[Nemunas River]], and some of its tributaries carry international shipping.

[[File:Lithuania Centre of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|The Geographic centre of Europe according to Affholder's theory.]]
Lithuania lies at the edge of the [[North European Plain]]. Its landscape was smoothed by the glaciers of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], and is a combination of moderate lowlands and highlands. Its highest point is [[Aukštojas Hill]] at {{convert|294|m|ft|0}} in the eastern part of the country. The terrain features [[List of lakes in Lithuania|numerous lakes]] ([[Lake Vištytis]], for example) and wetlands, and a mixed forest zone covers over 33% of the country. [[Drūkšiai]] is the largest, [[Tauragnas]] is the deepest and [[Asveja]] is the longest lake in Lithuania.

After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the [[continent]] of Europe in 1989, Jean-George Affholder, a scientist at the [[Institut géographique national (France)|Institut Géographique National]] (French National Geographic Institute), determined that the [[geographic centre of Europe]] was in Lithuania, at {{coord|54|54|N|25|19|E|type:landmark|name=Purnuškės (centre of gravity)}}, {{convert|26|km|mi}} north of Lithuania's capital city of [[Vilnius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/other.htm |title=Other Places of Interest: Central Europe |author=Jan S. Krogh |access-date=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affholder accomplished this by calculating the [[centre of gravity]] of the [[Geography of Europe|geometrical figure]] of Europe.

===Climate===
{{Main|Geography of Lithuania#Climate}}
Lithuania has a temperate climate with both [[maritime climate|maritime]] and [[continental climate|continental]] influences. It is defined as [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (Dfb) under the [[Köppen climate classification]] (but is close to [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] in a narrow coastal zone).

Average temperatures on the coast are {{convert|-2.5|C}} in January and {{convert|16|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July. In Vilnius the average temperatures are {{convert|-6|°C|0|abbr=on}} in January and {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July. During the summer, {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} is common during the day while {{convert|14|°C|0|abbr=on}} is common at night; in the past, temperatures have reached as high as {{convert|30|or|35|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Some winters can be very cold. {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} occurs almost every winter. Winter extremes are {{convert|-34|°C|0|abbr=on}} in coastal areas and {{convert|-43|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the east of Lithuania.

The average annual precipitation is {{convert|800|mm|1|abbr=on}} on the coast, {{convert|900|mm|1|abbr=on}} in the Samogitia highlands and {{convert|600|mm|1|abbr=on}} in the eastern part of the country. Snow occurs every year, it can snow from October to April. In some years sleet can fall in September or May. The growing season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern part. Severe storms are rare in the eastern part of Lithuania but common in the coastal areas.

The longest records of measured temperature in the Baltic area cover about 250 years. The data show warm periods during the latter half of the 18th century, and that the 19th century was a relatively cool period. An early 20th-century warming culminated in the 1930s, followed by a smaller cooling that lasted until the 1960s. A warming trend has persisted since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltex-research.eu/BACC/events/goteborg/Poster_2_1.pdf |title=Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin – The BACC Project – 22–23&amp;nbsp;May 2006, Göteborg, Sweden |access-date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania experienced a drought in 2002, causing forest and [[peat]] bog fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research Note Effect of drought and fires on the quality of water in Lithuanian rivers|year=2003 |bibcode=2003HESS....7..423S |author=G.

After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the ''Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas'' (Environmental Protection Act) was adopted already in 1992. The law provided the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection, established the basic rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in preserving the biodiversity inherent in Lithuania, ecological systems and the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas|url=https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.E2780B68DE62/vsPTFQpUEB|website=e-tar.lt|access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania agreed to cut [[carbon emissions]] by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020 and by at least 40% by the year 2030, together with all European Union members.

Lithuanian ecosystems include natural and semi-natural (forests, bogs, wetlands and meadows), and anthropogenic (agrarian and urban) ecosystems. Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important to Lithuania, covering 33% of the country's territory. Wetlands (raised bogs, fens, transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980. Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table. There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000&amp;nbsp;km in Lithuania, the [[Nemunas River]] basin occupying 74% of the territory of the country. Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared. In some cases, river and lake ecosystems continue to be impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication.&lt;ref name="cbd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithuania – Biodiversity Facts|url=https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/default.shtml?country=lt#facts|website=cbd.int|access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural land comprises 54% of Lithuania's territory (roughly 70% of that is arable land and 30% meadows and pastures), approximately 400,000 ha of agricultural land is not farmed, and acts as an ecological niche for weeds and invasive plant species. Habitat deterioration is occurring in regions with very productive and expensive lands as crop areas are expanded. Currently, 18.9% of all plant species, including 1.87% of all known fungi species and 31% of all known species of lichens, are listed in the [[List of extinct and endangered species of Lithuania|Lithuanian Red Data Book]]. The list also contains 8% of all fish species.&lt;ref name="cbd"/&gt;

The wildlife populations have rebounded as the hunting became more restricted and urbanization allowed replanting forests (forests already tripled in size since their lows). Currently, Lithuania has approximately 250,000 larger wild animals or 5 per each square kilometer. The most prolific large wild animal in every part of Lithuania is the [[roe deer]], with 120,000 of them. They are followed by [[boar]]s (55,000). Other ungulates are the [[deer]] (~22,000), [[fallow-deer]] (~21,000) and the largest one: [[moose]] (~7,000). Among the Lithuanian predators, [[fox]]es are the most common (~27,000). [[Wolve]]s are, however, more ingrained into the mythology as there are just 800 in Lithuania. Even rarer are the [[lynx]]es (~200). The large animals mentioned above exclude the [[rabbit]], ~200,000 of which may live in the Lithuanian forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fauna of Lithuania|url=http://www.truelithuania.com/tag/fauna-of-lithuania|website=TrueLithuania.com|access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges of the [[Constitutional Court of Lithuania|Constitutional Court]] (''Konstitucinis Teismas'') serve nine-year terms. They are appointed by the President, the Chairman of the Seimas, and the Chairman of the Supreme Court, each of whom appoint three judges. The [[unicameral]] Lithuanian parliament, the [[Seimas]], has 141 members who are elected to four-year terms. 71 of the members of its members are elected in single-member constituencies, and the others in a nationwide vote by [[proportional representation]]. A party must receive at least 5% of the national vote to be eligible for any of the 70 national seats in the Seimas.&lt;ref name="Seimas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seimo rinkimai|url=http://www.lrs.lt/sip/portal.show?p_r=15405&amp;p_k=1|website=lrs.lt|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties and elections===
{{Main|Elections in Lithuania}}
Lithuania was one of the first countries in the world to [[Women's suffrage|grant women a right to vote]] in the elections. Lithuanian women were allowed to vote by the [[Constitution of Lithuania#Interwar constitutions|1918 Constitution of Lithuania]] and used their newly granted right for the first time in 1919. By doing so, Lithuania allowed it earlier than such democratic countries as the [[United States]] (1920), [[France]] (1945), [[Feminism in Greece|Greece]] (1952), [[Switzerland]] (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baronienė |first1=Daiva |title=Teisę balsuoti Lietuvos moterys gavo vienos pirmųjų pasaulyje |url=https://www.lzinios.lt/Gimtasis-krastas/teise-balsuoti-lietuvos-moterys-gavo-vienos-pirmuju-pasaulyje/287033 |website=Lzinios.lt |access-date=11 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511092317/https://www.lzinios.lt/Gimtasis-krastas/teise-balsuoti-lietuvos-moterys-gavo-vienos-pirmuju-pasaulyje/287033 |archive-date=11 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each municipality in Lithuania is governed by a [[municipal council]] and a [[mayor]], who is a member of the municipal council. The number of members, elected on a four-year term, in each municipal council depends on the size of the municipality and varies from 15 (in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents) to 51 (in municipalities with more than 500,000 residents). 1,524 municipal council members were elected in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrk.lt/naujienos/-/content/10180/1/vrk-prieme-svarbius-sprendimus-artejanciu-savivaldybiu-tarybu-rinkimu-klausimais |title=VRK priėmė svarbius sprendimus artėjančių savivaldybių tarybų rinkimų klausimais |language=lt |trans-title=CEC took important decisions regarding the upcoming election to municipal councils |date=23 September 2014 |publisher=Central Electoral Commission |access-date=31 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212040822/http://www.vrk.lt/naujienos/-/content/10180/1/vrk-prieme-svarbius-sprendimus-artejanciu-savivaldybiu-tarybu-rinkimu-klausimais |archive-date=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council, with the exception of the mayor, are elected using proportional representation.

===Law and law enforcement===
{{Main|Law of Lithuania}}
[[File:Lithuanian Police A6 (2018).jpg|thumb|Lithuanian Police in [[Gediminas Avenue]], Vilnius]]
After regaining of independence in 1990, the largely modified Soviet legal codes were in force for about a decade. The current [[Constitution of Lithuania]] was adopted on 25 October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos Konstitucija|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/home/Konstitucija/Konstitucija.htm|website=lrs.lt|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Civil Code of Lithuania]] was passed in [[Seimas]]. It was succeeded by the [[Criminal Code]] and [[Criminal Procedure]] Code in 2003. The approach to the [[criminal law]] is [[inquisitorial]], as opposed to [[Adversarial system|adversarial]]; it is generally characterised by an insistence on formality and rationalisation, as opposed to practicality and informality. Normative legal act enters into force on the next day after its publication in the ''Teisės aktų registras'', unless it has a later entry into force date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuo 2014 m. sausio 1 d. teisės aktai oficialiai skelbiami Teisės aktų registre|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_show?p_r=4443&amp;p_d=143651&amp;p_k=1|website=3.lrs.lt|access-date=24 February 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union law]] is an integral part of the Lithuanian legal system since 1 May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nacionalinės teisės aktų derinimo su Europos Sąjungos teise metodiniai nurodymai|url=http://www.etd.lt/index.php?189546198|website=etd.lt|access-date=22 October 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090653/http://www.etd.lt/index.php?189546198|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania, after breaking away from the Soviet Union had a difficult crime situation, however, the Lithuanian law enforcement agencies eliminated many criminals over the years, making Lithuania a reasonably safe country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LRT dokumentikos ciklas "Nematoma Lietuvos istorija" – apie valstybės pergalę prieš mafiją|url=http://www.lrt.lt/televizija/anonsai/22093/lrt-dokumentikos-ciklas-nematoma-lietuvos-istorija-apie-valstybes-pergale-pries-mafija|website=LRT|access-date=5 September 2016|language=lt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228223636/http://www.lrt.lt/televizija/anonsai/22093/lrt-dokumentikos-ciklas-nematoma-lietuvos-istorija-apie-valstybes-pergale-pries-mafija|archive-date=28 February 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime in Lithuania has been declining rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=21469|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508011825/https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=21469|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 May 2017|title=Lithuania 2017 Crime &amp; Safety Report|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement in Lithuania is primarily the responsibility of local ''Lietuvos policija'' (Lithuanian Police) commissariats. They are supplemented by the ''Lietuvos policijos antiteroristinių operacijų rinktinė Aras'' (Anti-Terrorist Operations Team of the Lithuanian Police ''Aras''), ''Lietuvos kriminalinės policijos biuras'' (Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau), ''Lietuvos policijos kriminalistinių tyrimų centras'' (Lithuanian Police Forensic Research Center) and ''Lietuvos kelių policijos tarnyba'' (Lithuanian Road Police Service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos policija|url=https://policija.lrv.lt/|website=policija.lrv.lt|access-date=31 March 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, there were 63,846 crimes registered in Lithuania. Of these, thefts comprised a large part with 19,630 cases (13.2% less than in 2016). While 2,835 crimes were very hard and hard (crimes that may result in more than six years imprisonment), which is 14.5% less than in 2016. Totally, 129 homicides or attempted homicide occurred (19.9% less than in 2016), while serious bodily harm was registered 178 times (17.6% less than in 2016). Another problematic crime [[contraband]] cases also decreased by 27.2% from 2016 numbers. Meanwhile, crimes in electronic data and information technology security fields noticeably increased by 26.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Užregistruota ir ištirta nusikalstamų veikų (2017 / Sausis – Gruodis)|url=https://www.ird.lt/lt/paslaugos/nusikalstamu-veiku-zinybinio-registro-nvzr-paslaugos/ataskaitos-1/nusikalstamumo-ir-ikiteisminiu-tyrimu-statistika-1/view_item_datasource?id=6763&amp;datasource=18743|website=Ird.lt|access-date=31 March 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013 Special Eurobarometer, 29% of Lithuanians said that corruption affects their daily lives (EU average 26%).

According to scientist Gintautas Sakalauskas, this is not because of a high criminality rate in the country, but due to Lithuania's high repression level and the lack of trust of the convicted, who are frequently sentenced to a jail imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuo mažiau pasitikėjimo, tuo pilnesni kalėjimai: Lietuva kalinių skaičiumi pirmauja|url=https://www.lzinios.lt/lzinios/lietuva/kuo-maziau-pasitikejimo-tuo-pilnesni-kalejimai-lietuva-kaliniu-skaiciumi-pirmauja/248403|website=LZINIOS.lt|access-date=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812032325/http://lzinios.lt/lzinios/Lietuva/kuo-maziau-pasitikejimo-tuo-pilnesni-kalejimai-lietuva-kaliniu-skaiciumi-pirmauja/248403|archive-date=12 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Lithuania}}
{{See also|Counties of Lithuania|Municipalities of Lithuania|Elderships of Lithuania}}
{{Map of Counties of Lithuania|100px|float=right}}
The current system of administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union. The country's [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]] (Lithuanian: singular – ''apskritis'', plural – ''apskritys'') are subdivided into [[Municipalities of Lithuania|60 municipalities]] (Lithuanian: singular – ''savivaldybė'', plural – ''savivaldybės''), and further divided into 500 [[Elderships of Lithuania|elderships]] (Lithuanian: singular – ''seniūnija'', plural – ''seniūnijos'').

Municipalities have been the most important unit of administration in Lithuania since the system of [[County governor (Lithuania)|county governorship]] (''apskrities viršininkas'') was dissolved in 2010.&lt;ref name="county"&gt;{{in lang|lt}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=349513 (Republic of Lithuania Annul Law on County Governing)], [[Seimas]] law database, 7 July 2009, Law no. XI-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipalities are historically called "district municipalities" (often shortened to "district"), while others are called "city municipalities" (sometimes shortened to "city"). Each has its own elected government. The election of municipality councils originally occurred every three years, but now takes place every four years. The council appoints [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] to govern the elderships. Mayors have been directly elected since 2015; prior to that, they were appointed by the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|lt}} Justinas Vanagas, [http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/seimas-iteisino-tiesioginius-meru-rinkimus.d?id=65139619 Seimo Seimas įteisino tiesioginius merų rinkimus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014091111/https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/seimas-iteisino-tiesioginius-meru-rinkimus.d?id=65139619 |date=14 October 2017 }}, Delfi.lt, 26 June 2014. Retrieved 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest administrative units and do not play a role in national politics. They provide necessary local public services—for example, registering births and deaths in rural areas. They are most active in the social sector, identifying needy individuals or families and organizing and distributing welfare and other forms of relief.&lt;ref name="elderates"&gt;{{in lang|lt}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter2/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=146527 Lietuvos Respublikos vietos savivaldos įstatymo pakeitimo įstatymas], [[Seimas]] law database, 12 October 2000, Law no. VIII-2018. Retrieved 3 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some citizens feel that elderships have no real power and receive too little attention, and that they could otherwise become a source of local initiative for addressing rural problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|lt}} Indrė Makaraitytė, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171014091123/https://www.delfi.lt/archive/europos-sajungos-pinigai-kaimo-neisgelbes.d?id=5663231 Europos Sąjungos pinigai kaimo neišgelbės], Atgimimas, Delfi.lt, 16 December 2004.

{{Main|Foreign relations of Lithuania}}

Lithuania became a member of the United Nations on 18 September 1991, and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements. It is also a member of the [[European Union]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], as well as [[NATO]] and its adjunct North Atlantic Coordinating Council. Lithuania gained membership in the [[World Trade Organization]] on 31 May 2001, and joined the [[OECD]] on 5 July 2018,&lt;ref name="Lithuania's accession to the OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/lithuania/lithuania-accession-to-the-oecd.htm |publisher=[[OECD]]|title=Lithuania's accession to the OECD|date=5 July 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also seeking membership in other Western organizations.

Lithuania has established diplomatic relations with 149 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urm.lt/index.php?949836981 |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs: List of countries with which Lithuania has established diplomatic relations |website=Urm.lt |access-date=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Lithuania hosted the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Ministerial Council Meeting. During the second half of 2013, Lithuania assumed the role of the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency of the European Union]].

[[File:Lithuania presidency EU stamp 2013.jpg|thumb|right|The stamp is dedicated to Lithuania's presidency of the European Union. Post of Lithuania, 2013.]]
Lithuania is also active in developing cooperation among northern European countries. It has been a member of the Baltic Council since its establishment in 1993. The Baltic Council, located in [[Tallinn]], is a permanent organisation of international cooperation that operates through the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the Baltic Council of Ministers.

Lithuania also cooperates with Nordic and the two other Baltic countries through the [[NB8]] format. A similar format, NB6, unites Nordic and Baltic members of EU. NB6's focus is to discuss and agree on positions before presenting them to the Council of the European Union and at the meetings of EU foreign affairs ministers.

The [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] (CBSS) was established in [[Copenhagen]] in 1992 as an informal regional political forum. Its main aim is to promote integration and to close contacts between the region's countries. The members of CBSS are [[Iceland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], Lithuania, [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and the European Commission. Its observer states are [[Belarus]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Ukraine]].

The [[Nordic Council|Nordic Council of Ministers]] and Lithuania engage in political cooperation to attain mutual goals and to determine new trends and possibilities for joint cooperation. The council's information office aims to disseminate [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] concepts and to demonstrate and promote Nordic cooperation.

[[File:Bachelet en Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU (2015).jpg|thumb|left|Lithuania was recently a member of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Its representatives are on the right side.]]
Lithuania, together with the five Nordic countries and the two other Baltic countries, is a member of the [[Nordic Investment Bank|Nordic Investment Bank (NIB)]] and cooperates in its NORDPLUS programme, which is committed to education.

The Baltic Development Forum (BDF) is an independent nonprofit organization that unites large companies, cities, business associations and institutions in the Baltic Sea region.

The Lithuanian National Defence Policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the state, the [[integrity]] of its land, territorial waters and airspace, and its constitutional order. Its main strategic goals are to defend the country's interests, and to maintain and expand the capabilities of its armed forces so they may contribute to and participate in the missions of NATO and European Union member states.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.lt/kam/download/7963/bk-en1.pdf |title=White Paper Lithuanian defence policy |language=lt |website=Kam.lt |access-date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Lithuania}}
Agriculture in Lithuania dates to the [[Neolithic]] period, about 3,000 to 1,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]. It has been one of Lithuania's most important occupations for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jurginis|first1=J.|title=Arimo įrankių reikšmė žemdirbystės sistemoms|url=http://lad.lt/data/com_ladlibrary/988/156-163.pdf|website=lad.lt|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania's accession to the [[European Union]] in 2004 ushered in a new agricultural era. The EU pursues a very high standard of food safety and purity. In 1999, the [[Seimas]] (parliament) of Lithuania adopted a Law on Product Safety, and in 2000 it adopted a Law on Food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Product Safety|url=https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/f9a7f340736a11e6a0f68fd135e6f40c?jfwid=-brx0ubedz|website=e-seimas.lrs.lt|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Food|url=https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/74505e2018da11e6aa14e8b63147ee94?jfwid=rivwzvpvg|website=e-seimas.lrs.lt|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform of the agricultural market has been carried out on the basis of these two laws.

In 2016, agricultural production was made for 2.29 billion euros in Lithuania. [[Cereal crops]] occupied the largest part of it (5709,7 tons), other significant types were [[sugar beet]]s (933,9 tons), [[rapeseed]] (392,5 tons) and [[potato]]es (340,2 tons). Products for 4385,2 million euros were exported from Lithuania to the foreign markets, of which products for 3165,2 million euros were Lithuanian origin. Export of agricultural and food products accounted for 19.4% of all exports of goods from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Žemės ir maisto ūkio 2016 metų apžvalga|url=https://zum.lrv.lt/uploads/zum/documents/files/LT_versija/Veiklos_sritys/Statistin%C4%97%20informacija/%C5%BDem%C4%97s%20ir%20maisto%20%C5%ABkio%202016%20met%C5%B3%20ap%C5%BEvalga%20(03).pdf|website=zum.lrv.lt|pages=1–3|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organic farming]] is constantly becoming more popular in Lithuania. The status of organic growers and producers in the country is granted by the public body ''Ekoagros''. In 2016, there were 2539 such farms that occupied 225541,78 hectares. Of these, 43,13% were cereals, 31,22% were perennial grasses, 13,9% were leguminous crops and 11,75% were others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veiklos ataskaita, 2016 m.|url=https://www.ekoagros.lt/media/1/2016-m-veiklos-ataskaita.pdf|website=ekoagros.lt|pages=1–4|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foundation of the [[University of Vilnius]] in 1579 was a major factor of establishing local scientist community in Lithuania and making connections with other universities and scientists of Europe. [[Georg Forster]], [[Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert]], [[Johann Peter Frank]] and many other visiting scientists have worked at University of Vilnius.
Lithuanian ''[[bajoras]]'' and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] artillery expert [[Kazimieras Simonavičius]] is a pioneer of [[rocket]]ry, who has published ''Artis Magnae Artilleriae'' in 1650 that for over two centuries was used in Europe as a basic [[artillery]] manual and contains a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for military and civil purposes), including [[multistage rocket]]s, [[rocket battery|batteries of rockets]], and rockets with [[delta wing]] [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|stabilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=44|title=Astronautics|author=Ulrich Walter|publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]]|year=2008|isbn=978-3-527-40685-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazimieras Simonavičius|url=http://www.ksu.lt/en/kazimieras-simonavicius-2/|website=[[Kazimieras Simonavičius University]]|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A botanist Jurgis Pabrėža (1771-1849), created first systematic guide of Lithuanian flora ''Taislius auguminis'' (''Botany''), written in Samogitian dialect, the Latin-Lithuanian dictionary of plant names, first Lithuanian textbook of geography.

===Water supply and sanitation===
[[File:Heilquelle.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Mineral water spring in [[Birštonas]]]]
Lithuania has one of the largest fresh water supplies, compared with other countries in Europe. Lithuania and [[Denmark]] are the only countries in Europe, which are fully equipped with fresh groundwater. Lithuanians consume about 0.5 million cubic meters of water per day, which is only 12–14 percent of all explored fresh groundwater resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gėlo vandens ištekliais Lietuva išsiskiria iš kitų Europos šalių|url=http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/lietuvoje/2/137832/gelo-vandens-istekliais-lietuva-issiskiria-is-kitu-europos-saliu|website=LRT|date=25 May 2016|access-date=25 May 2016|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality in the country is very high and is determined by the fact that drinking water comes from deep layers that are protected from pollution on the surface of the earth. Drilling depth usually reaches 30–50 meters, but in [[Klaipėda Region]] it even reaches 250 meters. Consequently, Lithuania is one of very few European countries where groundwater is used for centralized water supply. With a large underground fresh water reserves, Lithuania exports mineral-rich water to other countries. Approved mineral water quantity is about 2.7 million cubic meters per year, while production is only 4–5 percent of all mineral water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gėlas vanduo – milžiniškas turtas Lietuvos gelmėse|url=http://alkas.lt/2012/03/15/gelas-vanduo-milziniskas-turtas-lietuvos-gelmese/|website=alkas.lt|date=15 March 2012|access-date=15 March 2012|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vilnius]] is the only Baltic capital that uses centralized water supplying from deep water springs, which are protected from pollution and has no [[nitrates]] or [[nitrites]] that are harmful to the human body. Water is cleaned without chemicals in Lithuania. About 20% of the consumed water in the state is a non-filtered very high quality water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raudonis|first1=Jokūbas|title=Vilniaus turtas – švarus vanduo iš giluminių šaltinių|url=https://verslas.lrytas.lt/rinkos-pulsas/2013/05/08/news/vilniaus-turtas---svarus-vanduo-is-giluminiu-saltiniu-5024475/|website=lrytas.lt|date=8 May 2013|access-date=8 May 2013|language=lt-LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Lithuanians make up about five-sixths of the country's population and Lithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic States. In 2015, the population of Lithuania stands at 2,921,262, 84.2% of whom are ethnic [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]] who speak [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], which is the official language of the country. Several sizeable minorities exist, such as [[Poles]] (6.6%), [[Russians]] (5.8%), [[Belarusians]] (1.2%) and [[Ukrainians]] (0.5%).&lt;ref name="2011a"/&gt;

===Urbanization===
{{See also|List of cities in Lithuania}}
There has been a steady [[Urbanization|movement of population to the cities]] since the 1990s, encouraged by the planning of regional centres, such as [[Alytus]], [[Marijampolė]], [[Utena]], [[Plungė]], and [[Mažeikiai]]. By the early 21st century, about two-thirds of the total population lived in urban areas. {{As of|2015}}, 66.5% of the total population lives in urban areas.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Lithuania's [[Larger urban zone|functional urban areas]] include [[Vilnius]] (population 696,000 in 2016) and [[Kaunas]] (population 387,000 in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150903213351/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt; The fDI of the Financial Times in their research ''Cities and Regions of the Future 2018/19'' ranked Vilnius fourth in the mid-sized European cities category and Vilnius county was ranked 10th in the small European regions category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/download/71341/2038156/file/fDi%20European%20Cities%20and%20Regions%20of%20the%20Future%202018:19.pdf|website=Fdiintelligence.com|page=57,73|title=Cities and Regions of the Future 2018/19|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Lithuania ranked 27th in Europe in the [[Euro health consumer index]], a ranking of European healthcare systems based on waiting time, results and other indicators.

{{As of|2019}} Lithuanian [[life expectancy]] at birth was 76.0 (71.2 years for males and 80.4 for females)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life expectancy and Healthy life expectancy, data by country|language=en|publisher=World Health Organization|url=https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688|date=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[infant mortality]] rate was 2.99 per 1,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infant mortality rate - Total|publisher=[[UN]] Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation|url=https://childmortality.org/data/Lithuania}}{{Dead link|date=May 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual population growth rate increased by 0.3% in 2007.

By 2000 the vast majority of Lithuanian health care institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed, providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket. The [[Ministry of Health (Lithuania)|Ministry of Health]] also runs a few health care facilities and is involved in the running of the two major Lithuanian teaching hospitals. It is responsible for the State Public Health Centre which manages the public health network including ten county public health centres with their local branches.

The Catholic Church was persecuted by the Russian Empire as part of the [[Russification]] policies and by the Soviet Union as part of the overall [[Religion in the Soviet Union|anti-religious campaigns]]. During the Soviet era, some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime, as symbolised by the [[Hill of Crosses]] and exemplified by ''[[The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania]]''.

4.1% of the population are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], mainly among the Russian minority. The community of [[Old Believers]] (0.8% of population) dates back to the 1660s.

[[Protestants]] are 0.8%, of which 0.6% are [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and 0.2% are [[Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church|Reformed]].

The [[Lithuanian language]] (''lietuvių kalba'') is the official state language of Lithuania and is recognized as one of the [[official language]]s of the [[European Union]]. There are about 2.96 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 0.2 million abroad.

Lithuanian is a [[Baltic languages|Baltic language]], closely related to [[Latvian language|Latvian]], although they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. It is written in an adapted version of the [[Latin alphabet|Roman script]]. Lithuanian is believed to be the [[conservative (language)|linguistically most conservative]] living [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European tongue]], retaining many features of [[Proto Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]].&lt;ref name="zinkevicius"&gt;{{cite book | author = Z.

There are two main dialects of the Lithuanian language: [[Aukštaitian dialect]] and [[Samogitian dialect]]. Aukštaitian dialect is mainly used in the central, southern and eastern parts of Lithuania while Samogitian dialect is used in the western part of the country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvių kalbos tarmės|url=http://geografija6-8.mkp.emokykla.lt/lt/mo/zinynas/lietuviu_kalbos_tarmes/|access-date=27 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samogitian dialect also has many completely different words and is even considered a separate language by some linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Juozas Pabrėža: "Stipriausia kalba Lietuvoje yra žemaičių"|url=http://www.santarve.lt/aktualijos/seniunijoje/dr-juozas-pabreza-stipriausia-kalba-lietuvoje-yra-zemaiciu/|website=santarve.lt|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the distinguishing feature between the two main Lithuanian dialects is the unequal pronunciation of accented and unaccented two-vowels uo and ie.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The groundwork for written Lithuanian was laid in 16th and 17th centuries by Lithuanian noblemen and scholars, who promoted Lithuanian language, created dictionaries and published books – [[Mikalojus Daukša]], [[Stanislovas Rapolionis]], [[Abraomas Kulvietis]], [[Jonas Bretkūnas]], [[Martynas Mažvydas]], [[Konstantinas Sirvydas]], Simonas Vaišnoras-Varniškis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaišnoras Simonas (Varniškis) apie 1545 – †1600 XI 16|url=http://www.varniai-museum.lt/index.php?mid=11&amp;art=460&amp;langID=1|website=Varniai-museum.lt|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first grammar book of the Lithuanian language ''Grammatica Litvanica'' was published in Latin in 1653 by [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Danielius Kleinas]].

[[Jonas Jablonskis]]' works and activities are especially important for the Lithuanian literature moving from the use of dialects to a standard Lithuanian language. The linguistic material which he collected was published in the 20 volumes of [[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian]] and is still being used in research and in editing of texts and books. He also introduced the letter ''ū'' into Lithuanian writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Šlekonytė|first1=Jūratė|title=Lietuvių tautosakos populiarintojas Jonas Jablonskis|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/23_Sukaktys_Jablonskis.pdf|website=llti.lt|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of Lithuanian literature written in [[Latin]], the main scholarly language of the Middle Ages. The edicts of the Lithuanian King [[Mindaugas]] is the prime example of the literature of this kind. The [[Letters of Gediminas]] are another crucial heritage of the Lithuanian Latin writings.

One of the first Lithuanian authors who wrote in Latin was [[Mikołaj Hussowczyk|Nicolaus Hussovianus]] (around 1480 – after 1533). His poem ''Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis'' (''A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison''), published in 1523, describes the Lithuanian landscape, way of life and customs, touches on some actual political problems, and reflects the clash of paganism and Christianity. A person under the pseudonym {{ill|Michalo Lituanus|lt}} (around 1490 – 1560) wrote a treatise ''[[De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum]]'' (''On the Customs of Tatars, Lithuanians and Muscovites'') in the middle of the 16th century, but it was not published until 1615. An extraordinary figure in the cultural life of Lithuania in the 16th century was the lawyer and poet of Spanish origin Petrus Roysius Maurus Alcagnicensis (around 1505 – 1571). The publicist, lawyer, and mayor of Vilnius, [[Augustinus Rotundus]] (around 1520 -1582) wrote a no longer existent history of Lithuania in Latin around the year 1560. loannes Radvanus, a humanist poet of the second half of the 16th century, wrote an epic poem imitating the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil|Vergil]]. His ''Radivilias'', intended to become the Lithuanian national epic, was published in Vilnius in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dambrauskaitė |first1=Ramunė |title=A Latin Funeral Oration From Vilnius (1594) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=101lb8v-bJcC&amp;pg=PA253 |publisher=Leuven University Press, Humanistica Lovaniensia |access-date=13 July 2018 |location=Leuven |page=253 |date=1995|isbn=9789061866800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17th century Lithuanian scholars also wrote in Latin – Kazimieras Kojelavičius-Vijūkas, [[Žygimantas Liauksminas]] are known for their Latin writings in theology, rhetorics and music. Albertas Kojalavičius-Vijūkas wrote first printed Lithuanian history ''Historia Lithuania''.

Lithuanian literary works in the [[Lithuanian language]] started being first published in the 16th century. In 1547 [[Martynas Mažvydas]] compiled and published the first printed Lithuanian book ''Katekizmo prasti žodžiai'' (''The Simple Words of Catechism''), which marks the beginning of literature, printed in Lithuanian. He was followed by [[Mikalojus Daukša]] with ''Katechizmas''. In the 16th and 17th centuries, as in the whole Christian Europe, Lithuanian literature was primarily religious.

The evolution of the old (14th–18th century) Lithuanian literature ends with [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]], one of the most prominent authors of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Donelaitis' poem ''Metai'' (''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]'') is a landmark of the Lithuanian fiction literature, written in [[hexameter]].&lt;ref name="INST"&gt;Institute of Lithuanian Scientific Society. {{cite web|url=http://anthology.lms.lt/ |title=Lithuanian Classic Literature |access-date=16 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204191505/http://anthology.lms.lt/ |archive-date=4 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a mix of [[Classicism]], [[Sentimentalism (literature)|Sentimentalism]] and [[Romanticism]], the Lithuanian literature of the first half of the 19th century is represented by [[Maironis]], [[Antanas Baranauskas]], [[Simonas Daukantas]], [[Oscar Milosz]], and [[Simonas Stanevičius]].&lt;ref name="INST" /&gt; During the Tsarist annexation of Lithuania in the 19th century, the [[Lithuanian press ban]] was implemented, which led to the formation of the [[Knygnešiai]] (Book smugglers) movement. This movement is thought to be the very reason the Lithuanian language and literature survived until today.

20th-century Lithuanian literature is represented by [[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas]], [[Antanas Vienuolis]], [[Bernardas Brazdžionis]], [[Antanas Škėma]], [[Balys Sruoga]], [[Vytautas Mačernis]] and [[Justinas Marcinkevičius]].

In 21st century debuted [[Kristina Sabaliauskaitė]], Renata Šerelytė, Valdas Papievis, [[Laura Sintija Černiauskaitė]], [[Ruta Sepetys|Rūta Šepetys]].

[[File:Kinas Romuva.JPG|thumb|[[Romuva Cinema]], the oldest still operational [[movie theater|cinema]] in Lithuania]]
On 28 July 1896, [[Thomas Edison]] live photography session was held in the Concerts Hall of the [[Botanical Garden of Vilnius University]]. After a year, similar American movies were available with the addition of special [[phonograph record]]s that also provided sound. In 1909, Lithuanian cinema pioneers {{ill|Antanas Račiūnas|lt}} and [[Ladislas Starevich]] released their first movies. Soon the Račiūnas' recordings of Lithuania's views became very popular among the [[Lithuanian Americans]] abroad. In 1925, Pranas Valuskis filmed movie ''Naktis Lietuvoje'' (Night in Lithuania) about [[Lithuanian book smugglers]] that left the first bright Lithuanian footprint in [[Hollywood]]. The most significant and mature Lithuanian American movie of the time ''Aukso žąsis'' (Golden goose) was created in 1965 by {{ill|Birutė Pūkelevičiūtė|lt}} that featured motifs from the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales. In 1940, [[Romuva Cinema]] was opened in [[Kaunas]] and currently is the oldest still operational cinema in Lithuania. After the occupation of the state, movies mostly were used for the [[Soviet propaganda]] purposes, nevertheless Almantas Grikevičius, Gytis Lukšas, Henrikas Šablevičius, Arūnas Žebriūnas, Raimondas Vabalas were able to overcome the obstacles and create valuable films. After the restoration of the independence, [[Šarūnas Bartas]], [[Audrius Stonys]], [[Arūnas Matelis]], Audrius Juzėnas, [[Algimantas Puipa]], {{ill|Janina Lapinskaitė|lt}}, Dijana and her husband Kornelijus Matuzevičius received success in international movie festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kino Lietuvoje istorija |url=https://sites.google.com/site/lietuvoskinas19/lietuvos-kinas |website=sites.google.com |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuanian folk music belongs to [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] music branch which is connected with [[neolithic]] [[corded ware]] culture. Two instrument cultures meet in the areas inhabited by Lithuanians: stringed ([[Kanklės|kanklių]]) and wind instrument cultures. Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of [[paganism]] faith. There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: [[monophony]], [[heterophony]] and [[polyphony]]. Folk song genres: Sutartinės (Multipart Songs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sutartinės, Lithuanian multipart songs|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/sutartines-lithuanian-multipart-songs-00433|website=ich.unesco.org|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wedding Songs, War-Historical Time Songs, Calendar Cycle and Ritual Songs and Work Songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthology of Lithuanian ethnoculture|url=http://www.lnkc.lt/eknygos/eka/|website=Lnkc.lt|access-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's long and difficult history.
Dairy products are an important part of traditional Lithuanian cuisine. These include white cottage cheese (''varškės sūris''), curd (''varškė''), soured milk (''rūgpienis''), sour cream (''grietinė''), butter (''sviestas''), and sour cream butter ''kastinis''. Traditional meat products are usually seasoned, matured and smoked – smoked sausages (''dešros''), lard (''lašiniai''), ''[[skilandis]]'', smoked ham (''kumpis''). Soups (''sriubos'') – boletus soup, cabbage soup, beer soup, milk soup, cold-beet soup (''šaltibarščiai'') and various kinds of porages (''košės'') are part of tradition and daily diet. Freshwater fish, herring, wild berries and mushrooms, honey are highly popular diet to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lietuvos virtuvė|url=https://maistologija.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/lietuvos-virtuve/|website=maistologija.wordpress.com|date=7 August 2010|access-date=25 March 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The only guide to Lithuanian cuisine you will ever need|url=https://www.urbanadventures.com/blog/guide-lithuanian-cuisine.html|website=Urbanadventures.com|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406041111/https://www.urbanadventures.com/blog/guide-lithuanian-cuisine.html|archive-date=6 April 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread is eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Lithuanians and other nations that once formed part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] share many dishes and beverages. [[German cuisine|German traditions]] also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (''kugelis'' or kugel) and [[Kishka (food)|potato sausages]] (''vėdarai''), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ''[[Šakotis]]''. The most exotic of all the influences is Eastern (Karaite) cuisine – the ''[[kibinai]]'' are popular in Lithuania. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs, so [[French cuisine]] influence came to Lithuania in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kokią įtaką Lietuvos virtuvei padarė prancūzai?|url=https://www.15min.lt/maistas/naujiena/virtuve/kokia-itaka-lietuvos-virtuvei-padare-prancuzai-1044-719414|website=15min.lt|access-date=26 March 2018|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the constitutional definition of freedom of expression does not protect certain acts, such as incitement to national, racial, religious, or social hatred, violence and discrimination, or slander, and disinformation. It is a crime to deny or "grossly trivialize" Soviet or Nazi German crimes against Lithuania or its citizens, or to deny genocide, [[crimes against humanity]], or [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204308|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017|website=State.gov|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
