The '''New York Yankees''' are an American professional [[baseball]] team based in the [[New York City]] [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[the Bronx]]. They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East division]]. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the [[National League]]'s (NL) [[New York Mets]]. The Yankees began play in the {{baseball year|1901}} season as the '''Baltimore Orioles''' (no relation to the modern [[Baltimore Orioles]]). In 1903, [[Frank J. Farrell|Frank Farrell]] and [[William Stephen Devery|Bill Devery]] purchased the franchise after it ceased operations and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the '''New York Highlanders'''.&lt;ref name="namechanges"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yankees Timeline 1903–1925|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/history/timeline1.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Yankees.com|access-date=February 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628020023/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/history/timeline1.jsp|archive-date=June 28, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Highlanders were officially renamed the '''New York Yankees''' in {{baseball year|1913}}.&lt;ref name="namechanges" /&gt;

The team is owned by [[Yankee Global Enterprises]], an LLC that is controlled by the family of the late [[George Steinbrenner]], who purchased the team in 1973. [[Brian Cashman]] is the team's general manager, and [[Aaron Boone]] is the team's [[manager (baseball)|field manager]]. The team's home games were played at the [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|original Yankee Stadium]] from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 to 2008. In 1974 and 1975, the Yankees shared [[Shea Stadium]] with the Mets, in addition to the [[New York Jets]] and the [[New York Giants]]. In 2009, they moved into a [[Yankee Stadium|new ballpark of the same name]] that was constructed adjacent to the previous facility, which was closed and demolished.&lt;ref name=newstadiumopening&gt;{{cite web|title=New Yankee Stadium|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/new_stadium.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Yankees.com|access-date=July 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714113852/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/new_stadium.jsp|archive-date=July 14, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is perennially among the leaders in [[List of Major League Baseball attendance figures|MLB attendance]].

From 1903 to 2020, the Yankees' overall win-loss record is 10,411–7,867 (a {{winpct|10411|7867}} winning percentage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Yankees Team History &amp; Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/index.shtml |website=Baseball Reference |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |access-date=2019-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322064908/https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/index.shtml |archive-date=March 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1941 season was often described as the last year of the "Golden Era" before the United States entered World War II and other realities intervened. It was a thrilling year as America watched two major events unfold: [[Ted Williams]] of the Red Sox hitting for the elusive .400 batting average and Joe DiMaggio getting hits in consecutive ballgames. By the end of his [[hitting streak]], DiMaggio [[Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak|hit in 56 consecutive games]], the current major league record and one often deemed unbreakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/20-baseball-records-that-may-never-be-broken-1.2875229|title=20 baseball records that may never be broken|access-date=April 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801033306/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/20-baseball-records-that-may-never-be-broken-1.2875229|archive-date=August 1, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the Yankees beat the [[1941 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in the [[1941 World Series]]—the first of seven October meetings between the two crosstown rivals before the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles—the United States naval fleet was attacked at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] by the Empire of Japan, and many of their best players, including DiMaggio, entered the military during World War II. The Yankees still managed to pull out a win against the [[1943 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1943 World Series]].

In 1945 construction magnate [[Del Webb]] and partners [[Dan Topping]] and [[Larry MacPhail]] purchased the team from the Ruppert estate for $2.8 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-del-webb-yankees|title=The Del Webb Yankees|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2010-07-23|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2011/09/04/the-yankees-fortune-classics-1946/|title=The Yankees (Fortune Classics, 1946)|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712165606/https://fortune.com/2011/09/04/the-yankees-fortune-classics-1946/|archive-date=July 12, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacPhail was bought out in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/03/archives/cbs-formally-completes-purchase-of-yankees-from-topping-and-webb-us.html|title=C.B.S.

After a few slumping seasons, McCarthy was fired early in 1946. A few interim managers later, [[Bucky Harris]] took the job, righting the ship and taking the Yankees to a hard-fought [[1947 World Series|series]] victory against the [[1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]].&lt;ref name="joe"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite finishing only three games behind the [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the 1948 pennant race, Harris was relieved of his duties and replaced by [[Casey Stengel]], who had a reputation of being a clown and managing bad teams.&lt;ref name="joe"/&gt; His tenure as Yankees' field manager, however, was marked with success. The "underdog" Yankees came from behind to catch and surprise a powerful [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] team on the last two days of the 1949 season, a face-off that fueled the beginning of the modern [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]]. By this time, however, DiMaggio's career was winding down, and the "Yankee Clipper" retired after the 1951 season. This year marked the arrival of the "Oklahoma Kid", [[Mickey Mantle]], who was one of several new stars to fill the gap.&lt;ref name="joe"/&gt;

===1951–1959: Stengel's Squad===
[[File:OpeningDay1951.gif|thumb|[[Opening Day]] of the 1951 baseball season at [[Griffith Stadium]]. President [[Harry Truman]] throws out the first ball as [[Bucky Harris]] and [[Casey Stengel]] look on.]]
Bettering the clubs managed by Joe McCarthy, the Yankees won the World Series five consecutive times from {{wsy|1949}}–{{wsy|1953}} under Stengel, which remains an MLB record. Led by players like center fielder [[Mickey Mantle]], pitcher [[Whitey Ford]], and catcher [[Yogi Berra]], Stengel's teams won ten pennants and seven World Series titles in his 12 seasons as the Yankees manager. The {{wsy|1950}} title was the only one of those five championships not to be won against either the [[Subway Series|New York Giants or Brooklyn Dodgers]]; it was won in four straight games against the [[Whiz Kids (baseball)|Whiz Kids]] of the [[1950 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]].

In 1954, the [[1954 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] won 103 games, but the [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] took the pennant with a then-AL record 111 wins; 1954 was famously referred to as ''The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant''. In {{wsy|1955}}, the [[1955 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] finally beat the [[1955 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the World Series, after five previous Series losses to them. The Yankees came back strong the next year.

The [[1957 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] lost the [[1957 World Series]] to the [[1957 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] when [[Lew Burdette]] incredibly won three games for the Braves. Following the Series, the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers both left for San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively. This left the Yankees as New York's only baseball team. In the [[1958 World Series]], the Yankees got their revenge against the Braves and became the second team to win the Series after being down 3–1. For the decade, the Yankees won six World Series championships (1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1958) and eight American League pennants (those six plus 1955 and 1957). Led by Mantle, Ford, Berra, [[Elston Howard]] (the Yankees' first African-American player), and the newly acquired [[Roger Maris]], the Yankees entered the 1960s seeking to replicate their success of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="joe"/&gt;

===1960–1964: Mantle and Maris===
[[File:Mickey Mantle 1953.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mickey Mantle]] was one of the franchise's most celebrated hitters, highlighted by his 1956 Triple Crown and World Series championship.]]
[[Arnold Johnson (industrialist)|Arnold Johnson]], owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], was a longtime business associate of then-Yankees co-owners [[Del Webb]] and [[Dan Topping]]. Because of this "special relationship" with the Yankees, he traded young players to them in exchange for cash and aging veterans. Invariably, these trades ended up being heavily tilted in the Yankees' favor, leading to accusations that the Athletics were little more than a Yankees farm team at the major league level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalsreview.com/2010/7/12/1565414/valuing-trades-between-the-kansas|title=Valuing Trades Between the Kansas City A's and New York Yankees|last=Zimmerman|first=Jeff|date=2010-07-12|website=Royals Review|access-date=2017-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204172234/http://www.royalsreview.com/2010/7/12/1565414/valuing-trades-between-the-kansas|archive-date=February 4, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kansas City had been home to the Yankees' top farm team for almost 20 years before the Athletics moved there from Philadelphia in 1954.&lt;ref name="mick"&gt;{{cite web

In 1960, [[Charles O. Finley]] purchased the Athletics and put an end to the trades. At that point, however, the Yankees had already strengthened their supply of future prospects, which included a young outfielder named [[Roger Maris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/358382-the-new-york-yankees-traded-roger-maris-for-him|title=The New York Yankees Traded Roger Maris for Him?|last=Friend|first=Harold|newspaper=Bleacher Report|access-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204170445/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/358382-the-new-york-yankees-traded-roger-maris-for-him|archive-date=February 4, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Maris led the league in slugging percentage, RBI, and extra-base hits. He finished second in home runs (one behind [[Mickey Mantle]]) and total bases, and won a [[Gold Glove]], which garnered enough votes for the American League MVP award.&lt;ref name="mick"/&gt;

The year 1961 was one of the most memorable in Yankees history.  Mantle and Maris hit home runs at a fast pace and became known as the "M&amp;M Boys".&lt;ref name=Secyclo/&gt;&lt;ref name="FLN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Yanks celebrate, M&amp;M Boys leave |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/271572870/https://www.newspapers.com/image/271572870/ |work=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale News]] |date=October 10, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a severe hip infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup. Maris continued though, and on October 1, the last day of the regular season, he hit home run number 61, surpassing Babe Ruth's single-season home run record of 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/maris_roger.html|title=ESPN Classic – Maris battled Mantle, media and Babe's legacy|website=ESPN|access-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204170340/http://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/maris_roger.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MLB Commissioner [[Ford Frick]] (who, as it was discovered later, had [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] for Babe Ruth during his career) decreed that since Maris had played in a 162-game season, and Ruth (in 1927) had played in a 154-game season, two separate records would be kept for 30 years, until MLB reversed course and Maris held the record alone.  His record would be broken by [[Mark McGwire]], who hit 70 home runs in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roger-maris-breaks-home-run-record|title=Roger Maris breaks home-run record – Oct 01, 1961|website=History|access-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204171333/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roger-maris-breaks-home-run-record|archive-date=February 4, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maris still holds the American League record.&lt;ref name="mick"/&gt;

The Yankees won the pennant with a 109–53 record and went on to defeat the [[1961 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in the [[1961 World Series]]. The team finished the year with a record 240 home runs.&lt;ref name="mick"/&gt;

In 1962, the sports scene in New York changed when the National League added an expansion team, the [[New York Mets]], who played at the Giants' former home, the [[Polo Grounds]], for two seasons while [[Shea Stadium]] was under construction in nearby [[Flushing, Queens]]. This restored New York as a city with more than one team, as it had been from the late 1800s until 1957.  The Yankees won the [[1962 World Series]], their tenth in the past sixteen years, defeating the [[1962 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] 4–3. It was the Yankees' last championship until [[1977 World Series|1977]].&lt;ref name="mick"/&gt;

The [[1963 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] easily reached the [[1963 World Series]] when they won the pennant by 10.5 games, but they scored only four runs in the series and were swept by the [[1963 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and their ace pitcher, [[Sandy Koufax]].&lt;ref name="mick"/&gt; After the season, Yogi Berra, who had just retired from playing, took over managerial duties. The aging [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] returned the next year for [[1964 World Series|a fifth straight World Series]], but were beaten 4–3 by the [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]]. It would be the Yankees' last World Series appearance until 1976.&lt;ref name="mick"/&gt;

===1965–1972: New ownership and a steep decline===
After the 1964 season, [[CBS]] purchased 80% of the Yankees from Topping and Webb for $11.2 million.&lt;ref name=1951to1975&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/history/timeline3.jsp|title=Yankees Timeline 1951–1975|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Yankees.com|access-date=March 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423102939/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/history/timeline3.jsp|archive-date=April 23, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new ownership, the team began to decline. The [[1965 New York Yankees season|1965 edition of the team]] posted a record of 77–85 — the Yankees' first losing record in 40 years.&lt;ref name="boss"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the [[1966 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] finished in last place in the AL for the first time since 1912.  It also marked their first consecutive losing seasons since 1917 and 1918.  They finished next-to-last in [[1967 New York Yankees season|1967]].  While their fortunes improved somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they finished higher than fourth only once during CBS' ownership, in [[1970 New York Yankees season|1970]].&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

The Yankees were not able to replace their aging superstars with promising young talent, as they had consistently done in the previous five decades.  As early as the 1961–62 off-season, longtime fans noticed that the pipeline of talent had started to dry up.  This was worsened by the introduction of the [[Major League Baseball Draft|amateur draft]] that year, which meant that the Yankees could no longer sign any player they wanted.  While the Yankees usually drafted fairly early during this period due to their lackluster records, [[Thurman Munson]] was the only pick who lived up to his billing.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

===1973–1981: Steinbrenner, Martin, Jackson, and Munson: the Bronx Zoo===
A group of investors, led by [[Cleveland]]-based shipbuilder [[George Steinbrenner]] (1930–2010), purchased the club from CBS in 1973, for $8.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Steinbrenner_George.html|title='The Boss' made Yankees a dictatorship|last=Puma|first=Mike|year=2007|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=January 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107015220/http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Steinbrenner_George.html|archive-date=January 7, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Burke stayed on as president until he quit in April. Within a year, Steinbrenner bought out most of his other partners and became the team's principal owner, although Burke continued to hold a minority share into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

One of Steinbrenner's major goals was to renovate Yankee Stadium.  It had greatly deteriorated by the late 1960s, and the surrounding neighborhood had gone south as well. CBS initially suggested renovations, but the team needed to play elsewhere, and the Mets refused to open their home, [[Shea Stadium]], to the Yankees. A new stadium in [[New Jersey Meadowlands|the Meadowlands]], across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]], was suggested (and was eventually built, as [[Giants Stadium]], specifically for football). Finally, in mid-1972, Mayor [[John Lindsay]] stepped in. The city bought the stadium and began an extensive two-year renovation period. Since the city also owned Shea Stadium, the Mets were forced to allow the Yankees to play two seasons there. The renovations modernized the look of the stadium, significantly altered the dimensions, and reconfigured some of the seating.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

In 1973, Steinbrenner started the rule as the second MLB team with a [[New York Yankees appearance policy|personal appearance policy]] that includes being clean-shaven, with long hair slicked back or trimmed. This rule is still in effect today, and enforced by his sons after George's passing.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt; The [[Cincinnati Reds]] had the same personal appearance policy from 1967 until 1999.

[[File:Yankee Stadium aerial from Blackhawk.jpg|thumb|During 1974 and 1975, [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] was renovated into its final shape and structure, as shown here in 2002, seven years before demolition.]]
After the 1974 [[1974 Major League Baseball season|season]], Steinbrenner made a move that started the modern era of [[Free agent|free agency]], signing star pitcher [[Catfish Hunter]] away from Oakland. Midway through the 1975 [[1975 Major League Baseball season|season]], the team hired former second baseman [[Billy Martin]] as manager. With Martin at the helm, the [[1976 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] reached the [[1976 World Series]], but were swept by the [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] and their famed "[[Big Red Machine]]."&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

After the 1976 campaign, Steinbrenner added star Oakland outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]]—who had spent 1976 with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]—to his roster. During spring training of 1977, Jackson alienated his teammates with controversial remarks about the Yankees captain, catcher [[Thurman Munson]]. He had bad blood with manager Billy Martin, who had managed the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] when Jackson's [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] defeated them in the [[1972 American League Championship Series|1972 playoffs]]. Jackson, Martin, and Steinbrenner repeatedly feuded with each other throughout Jackson's 5-year contract. Martin was hired and fired by Steinbrenner five times over the next 13 years. This conflict, combined with the extremely rowdy Yankees fans of the late 1970s and the bad conditions of the Bronx, led to the Yankees organization and stadium being referred to as the "Bronx Zoo."&lt;ref name=BronxZoo&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyle|first=Sparky|author-link=Sparky Lyle|author2=Golenbock, Peter |title=The Bronx Zoo: The Astonishing Inside Story of the 1978 World Champion New York Yankees|year=2005|publisher=Triumph Books|location=Illinois|isbn=1-57243-715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the turmoil, Jackson hit four home runs in [[1977 World Series]] and earned the [[World Series MVP Award|Series MVP Award]], and the nickname "Mr. October."&lt;ref name=MrOctober&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=116439|title=The Hall of Famers – Reggie Jackson|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|access-date=March 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406181917/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=116439|archive-date=April 6, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the late 1970s, the race for the pennant was often a close competition between the Yankees and the Red Sox. On July 14, 1978, the [[1978 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] were {{frac|14|1|2}} games behind the [[1978 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]]. In late July, Martin suspended Reggie Jackson for "defiance" after he bunted while Martin had the "swing" signal on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1117267-reggie-jackson-was-a-liar-and-george-steinbrenner-was-convicted-said-mr-martin|title=Reggie Jackson Was a Liar and George Steinbrenner Was Convicted, Said Mr. Martin|access-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172001/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1117267-reggie-jackson-was-a-liar-and-george-steinbrenner-was-convicted-said-mr-martin|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Jackson's return, Martin made a famous statement against both Jackson and owner Steinbrenner: "They deserve each other.

The Yankees continued to win games, making up ground and by the time they met Boston for a pivotal four-game series at [[Fenway Park]] in early September.  Going into the series, the Yankees were four games behind the Red Sox. The Yankees swept the Red Sox in what became known as the "Boston Massacre," winning the games 15–3, 13–2, 7–0, and 7–4. The third game was a shutout pitched by "Louisiana Lightning" [[Ron Guidry]], who led the majors with nine shutouts, a 25–3 record, and a 1.74 ERA.  On the last day of the season, the two clubs finished in a tie for first place in the AL East, and a tiebreaker game was held at Fenway Park. With Guidry pitching against former Yankee [[Mike Torrez]], the Red Sox took an early 2–0 lead. In the seventh inning, light-hitting Yankee shortstop [[Bucky Dent]] drove a three-run home run over the Fenway Park's [[Green Monster]], putting the Yankees up 3–2. Reggie Jackson's solo home run in the following inning sealed the eventual 5–4 win that gave the Yankees their one-hundredth win of the season and their third straight AL East title. Guidry earned his 25th win of the season.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

After defeating the [[1978 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] for the third consecutive year in the [[1978 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Yankees faced the [[1978 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1978 World Series|World Series]]. They lost the first two games in Los Angeles, but won all three games at Yankee Stadium and Game 6 back in Los Angeles, winning their 22nd World Championship.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

Changes occurred during the 1979 season. Former Cy Young Award-winning closer [[Sparky Lyle]] was traded to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for several players, including [[Dave Righetti]]. [[Tommy John]] was acquired from the Dodgers and [[Luis Tiant]] from the Red Sox to bolster the pitching staff. During the season, Bob Lemon was replaced by [[Billy Martin]].&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

[[File:Munson Gear.jpg|thumb|left|The mask and catcher's mitt of [[Thurman Munson]], the team captain who was killed in a plane crash in 1979]]
The 1970s ended on a tragic note for the Yankees. On August 2, 1979, catcher [[Thurman Munson]] died when his private plane crashed while he was practicing [[touch-and-go landing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coffey|first1=Wayne|title=25 years later, Thurman Munson's last words remain a symbol of his life|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/thurman-munson-final-hours-article-1.394320|work=New York Daily News|access-date=2014-09-28|date=August 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104211222/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/thurman-munson-final-hours-article-1.394320|archive-date=November 4, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the entire team flew out to [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], Ohio, for the funeral, despite having a game later that day against the [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]]. Martin adamantly stated that the funeral was more important and that he did not care if they made it back in time. [[Bobby Murcer]], a close friend of Munson's, was chosen to give the eulogy at his funeral. In a nationally televised and emotional game, Murcer used Munson's bat (which he gave to his fallen friend's wife after the game), and drove in all five of the team's runs in a dramatic 5–4 walk-off victory. Before the game, Munson's locker sat empty except for his catching gear, a sad reminder for his teammates. His locker, labeled with his number 15, has remained empty in the Yankees clubhouse as a memorial. When the Yankees moved across the street, Munson's locker was torn out and installed in the new Stadium's museum. The number 15 has been retired by the team.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

The 1980 season brought more changes. Billy Martin was fired once again and [[Dick Howser]] took his place. [[Chris Chambliss]] was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for catcher [[Rick Cerone]]. Reggie Jackson hit .300 for the only time in his career with 41 homers, and finished 2nd in the MVP voting to Kansas City's [[George Brett]]. The [[1980 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] won 103 games and the AL East by three games over the [[1980 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]], but were swept by the [[1980 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] in the [[1980 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

After the season ended, the Yankees signed [[Dave Winfield]] to a 10-year contract. The team fired Howser and replaced him with [[Gene Michael]]. Under Michael, the Yankees led the AL East before a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] hit in June 1981. In the second half of the season, the Yankees struggled under [[Bob Lemon]], who replaced Michael. Thanks to the split-season playoff format, the Yankees faced the second-half winner [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] in the special [[1981 American League Division Series]]. After defeating Milwaukee 3–2, they swept the [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in a three-game [[1981 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. In the [[1981 World Series|World Series]], the Yankees won the first two games against the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. But the Dodgers fought back to win the next four games to claim the World Series title.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

===1982–1995: Struggles during the Mattingly years===
[[File:Don Mattingly Strikes Out.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Don Mattingly]] headlined a Yankees franchise that struggled in the 1980s.]]
Following the team's loss to the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series, the Yankees began their longest absence from the playoffs since 1921. Following the example set by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the [[Big Red Machine]], Steinbrenner announced his plan to transform the Yankees from the "Bronx Bombers" into the "Bronx Burners," increasing the Yankees' ability to win games based on speed and defense&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabr.org/research/baseball-s-forgotten-era-80s|title=Baseball's Forgotten Era: The '80s|quote="There is an element of follow the leader that happened in the 1980s", Thorn said. "The Yankees remade their roster in the 1980s to utilize speed and defense. And it didn't work with that short porch."

As a first step towards this end, the Yankees signed [[Dave Collins]] from the [[Cincinnati Reds]] during the 1981 off-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/switch-hitting-dave-collins-time-new-york-yankees-short-sweet-article-1.184705|title=Switch-hitting OF Dave Collins' time with New York Yankees short but sweet|access-date=August 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816044228/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/switch-hitting-dave-collins-time-new-york-yankees-short-sweet-article-1.184705|archive-date=August 16, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays after the 1982 season in a deal that also included future All-Stars [[Fred McGriff]] and [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballmusings.com/archives/002372.php|title=Steinbrenner's Speed|access-date=August 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023152705/http://www.baseballmusings.com/archives/002372.php|archive-date=October 23, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return the Yankees got [[Dale Murray]] and [[Tom Dodd (baseball)|Tom Dodd]].

The Yankees of the 1980s were led by All-Star first baseman [[Don Mattingly]].  In spite of accumulating the most total wins of any major league team, they failed to win a World Series (the 1980s were the first decade since the 1910s in which the Yankees did not win at least two Series) and had only two playoff appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fans voicing displeasure with Yankees' ownership|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=August 31, 1989|page=A18|agency=Associated Press|quote=Steinbrenner said..."You have to look at the record. We didn't win a World Series this decade, but we had the best record of the 1980s of any team in the major leagues."...This is the first Yankee team since 1910–1919 to go an entire decade without winning a World Series title.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they consistently had a powerful offense —Mattingly at various times was teammate to [[Dave Winfield]] (whom Mattingly battled for the AL batting title through most of the 1984 season), [[Rickey Henderson]], [[Don Baylor]], [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]], [[Mike Pagliarulo]], [[Steve Sax]], and [[Jesse Barfield]], and the Yankees led MLB in runs scored for the decade — the Yankees teams of the 1980s lacked sufficient starting pitching to win a championship. After posting a 22–6 record in 1985, arm problems caught up with Guidry, and his performance declined over the next three years. Of the remaining mainstays of the Yankees' rotation, only [[Dave Righetti]] stood out, pitching a [[no-hitter]] on July 4, 1983, but he was moved to the bullpen the next year where he helped to define the closer role. Despite the Yankees' lack of pitching success during the 1980s, they had three of the premier pitchers of the early 1990s on their roster during these years in [[Al Leiter]], [[Doug Drabek]] and [[José Rijo]]. All were mismanaged and dealt away before they could reach their full potential, with only Rijo returning much value – he was traded to the Oakland A's in the deal that brought Henderson to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The team came close to winning the AL East in [[1985 New York Yankees season|1985]] and [[1986 New York Yankees season|1986]], finishing second to the [[1985 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], respectively, but fell to fourth place in [[1987 New York Yankees season|1987]] and fifth in [[1988 New York Yankees season|1988]], despite having mid-season leads in the AL East both years.&lt;ref name="80's"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the decade, the Yankees' offense declined. Henderson and Pagliarulo had departed by the middle of [[1989 New York Yankees season|1989]], while back problems hampered both Winfield (who missed the entire 1989 season) and Mattingly (who missed almost the entire second half of 1990). Winfield's tenure with the team ended when he was dealt to the [[Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]]. From 1989 to 1992, the team had a losing record, spending significant money on free-agents and draft picks who did not live up to expectations. In 1990, the [[1990 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] had the worst record in the American League, and their fourth last-place finish in franchise history.&lt;ref name="80's"/&gt;

During the 1990 season, Yankee fans started to chant "1918!" to taunt the Red Sox, reminding them of the last time they won a World Series one weekend the Red Sox were there in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=Yankees fans had taunted the Red Sox all weekend with chants of '1918, 1918!'—the last time Boston won the World Series—and the Red Sox are not allowed by long-suffering New Englanders to forget the pain they have wrought with years of excruciating near misses.|title=Pennant Chases in East Still Flying High, West All but Flagged|date=September 25, 1990|first=Mark|last=Maske|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=E3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each time the Red Sox were at Yankee Stadium afterward, chants of "1918!" echoed through the stadium.&lt;ref name="1918!Chants"&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankee fans also taunted the Red Sox with signs saying "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO", pictures of Babe Ruth, and wearing "1918!" T-shirts each time they were at the stadium.&lt;ref name="1918!Chants"/&gt;

The poor showings in the 1980s and early 1990s soon changed. Steinbrenner hired [[Howard Spira]] to uncover damaging information on Winfield and was subsequently suspended from day-to-day team operations by Commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] when the plot was revealed. This turn of events allowed management to implement a coherent acquisition/development program without owner interference. General Manager [[Gene Michael]], along with manager [[Buck Showalter]], shifted the club's emphasis from high-priced acquisitions to developing talent through the [[farm system]]. This new philosophy developed key players such as outfielder [[Bernie Williams]], shortstop [[Derek Jeter]], catcher [[Jorge Posada]], and pitchers [[Andy Pettitte]] and [[Mariano Rivera]]. The first significant success came in [[1994 New York Yankees season|1994]], when the Yankees had the best record in the AL, but the season was cut short by a [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees Fans Left with Broken Hearts|date=September 16, 1994|first=Larry|last=McShane|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New York's top ten worst moments in sports|date=September 16, 1997|first=Bob|last=Eckstein|journal=The Village Voice|volume=42|issue=37|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Yankees were last in a postseason in a season cut short by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]], the news media constantly reminded the Yankees about the parallels between these two Yankees teams, which included both teams having division leads taken away by strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/sports/baseball-flashback-to-81-another-lead-another-strike.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print|title=Flashback to '81: Another Lead, Another Strike|date=August 7, 1994|first=Jack|last=Curry|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|author-link=Jack Curry|access-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107071318/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/sports/baseball-flashback-to-81-another-lead-another-strike.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print|archive-date=November 7, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=Those who followed the [[1981 New York Yankees season|1981 New York Yankees]]...can't help but notice potential similarities with this year's first-place Yankee club.|title='81, '94 Yankees Both Winners but Worlds Apart in Personality|last=Kawakami|first=Tim|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=August 10, 1994|page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout October, the media continued to speculate about what might have been if there had not been a strike, making references to the day's games in the postseason would have been played.&lt;ref name=LostWorldSeries&gt;{{cite news|title=Finishing What They Started|date=April 25, 1995|first=Jack|last=O'Connell|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|page=G2|quote=In the lengthy and uncertain off-season, an unfair anointing was bestowed on the Yankees.

A year later, the team qualified for the playoffs in the new wild card slot in the strike-shortened 1995 season. In the memorable [[1995 American League Division Series]] against the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]], the Yankees won the first two games at home and lost the next three in Seattle. Although Mattingly batted .417 with a home run and six RBI in the only postseason series of his career, his back problems led him to retire after the 1995 season.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

The [[1996 New York Yankees season|1996 season]] saw the rise of three Yankees who formed the core of the team for years to come: rookie shortstop [[Derek Jeter]], second-year starting pitcher [[Andy Pettitte]], and second-year pitcher [[Mariano Rivera]], who served as [[setup man]] in 1996 before becoming [[closer (baseball)|closer]] in 1997. Aided by these young players, the Yankees won their first AL East title in 15 years. They defeated the [[1996 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in the [[1996 American League Division Series|ALDS]], and in [[1996 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] beat the [[1996 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] 4–1, which included a notable fan interference by [[Jeffrey Maier]] that was called as a home run for the Yankees. In the [[1996 World Series|World Series]] the team rebounded from an 0–2 series deficit and defeated the defending champion [[1996 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], ending an 18-year championship drought. Jeter was named Rookie of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/1996.shtml|title=1996 New York Yankees season summary|website=baseball-reference.com|access-date=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Yankees lost the [[1997 American League Division Series|1997 ALDS]] to the [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3–2. General manager [[Bob Watson]] stepped down and was replaced by assistant general manager [[Brian Cashman]].&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;

The [[1998 New York Yankees season|1998 Yankees]] are widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest teams in baseball history, compiling a record of 114–48, a then–AL record for the most wins in a season. On May 17, 1998, [[David Wells]] pitched a [[David Wells' perfect game|perfect game]] against the [[1998 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/1998-yankees-recall-david-wells-perfect-game-c277200168|title='98 Yanks reminisce about Wells' perfect game|last=Alber|first=David|date=May 17, 2018|website=MLB.com|access-date=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Yankees went on to sweep the [[1998 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] in the [[1998 World Series|World Series]]. Their 125 combined regular and postseason wins remains an MLB single-season record.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;

On July 18, 1999, [[David Cone]] pitched a [[David Cone's perfect game|perfect game]] against the [[1999 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. The [[1999 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] was the Yankees' first postseason meeting with the rival [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]]. The [[1999 New York Yankees season|1999 Yankees]] defeated the Red Sox 4–1 and swept the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] in the [[1999 World Series]] giving the 1998–99 Yankees a combined 22–3 record in the (including four series sweeps) in the six post-season series those years.

In 2000, the [[2000 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] faced the [[2000 New York Mets season|Mets]] in the first New York City [[Subway Series|Subway]] [[2000 World Series|World Series]] in 44 years. The Yankees won the series in 5 games, but a loss in Game 3 snapped their streak of consecutive games won in World Series contests at 14, surpassing the club's previous record of 12 (in 1927, 1928, and 1932). The Yankees are the last MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and after the 2000 season they joined the Yankees teams of 1936–39 and 1949–53, as well as the 1972–74 [[Oakland Athletics]] as the only teams to win at least three consecutive World Series.

In aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] defeated the [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[2001 American League Division Series|ALDS]], and the Seattle Mariners in the [[2001 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. By winning the pennant for a fourth straight year, the 1998–2001 Yankees joined the [[San Francisco Giants|1921–24 New York Giants]], and the Yankees teams of 1936–39, 1949–53, 1955–58 and 1960–64 as the only teams to win at least four straight pennants. The Yankees won 11 consecutive postseason series in this 4-year period. In the [[2001 World Series|World Series]] against the [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]], the Yankees lost the series when Rivera uncharacteristically blew a save in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Final Twist, New York Falls in Ninth|first=Buster|last=Olney|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 5, 2001|page=A1|author-link=Buster Olney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diamondbacks 3, Yankees 2|date=November 5, 2001|first=Ben|last=Walker|agency=Associated Press|quote=The other two all-home victory Series were both won by [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota]], {{wsy|1987}} and 1991.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, despite a very poor series overall, batting under .200, Derek Jeter got the nickname, "Mr. November", echoing comparisons to Reggie Jackson's "Mr. October", for his walk-off home run in Game 4, though it began October 31, as the game ended in the first minutes of November 1. In addition, the Yankees' home field in the aftermath of the attacks served as hosts of a memorial service titled "Prayer for America."

A vastly revamped [[2002 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] team finished the 2002 season with an AL-best record of 103–58. The season was highlighted by [[Alfonso Soriano]] becoming the first second baseman ever to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season. In the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]] the Yankees lost to the eventual World Series champion [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] 3–1.

In 2003, the [[2003 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] again had the best league record (101–61), highlighted by [[Roger Clemens]]' 300th win and 4000th strikeout. In the [[2003 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], they defeated the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in a dramatic seven-game series, which featured a bench-clearing incident in Game 3 and a series-ending [[walk-off home run]] by [[Aaron Boone]] in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7.

In 2005 Alex Rodriguez won the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award, becoming the first Yankee to win the award since Don Mattingly in 1985. The Yankees again won the AL East by virtue of a tiebreaker but lost the [[2005 American League Division Series|ALDS]] 3–2 to the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]]. The 2006 season was highlighted by a 5-game series sweep of the [[2006 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] at Fenway Park (sometimes referred to as the "Second Boston Massacre"), outscoring the Red Sox 49–26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees finish off five-game sweep|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2006/08/21/yankees_finish_off_five_game_sweep/|work=Boston Globe|access-date=March 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618204711/http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2006/08/21/yankees_finish_off_five_game_sweep/|archive-date=June 18, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite winning the AL East for the ninth consecutive year, the Yankees lost again in the [[2006 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. After the ALDS was over, tragedy struck when pitcher [[Cory Lidle]] died when his [[October 11, 2006 New York City plane crash|plane crashed]] into a highrise apartment building in Manhattan. Along with Thurman Munson, Lidle was the second active Yankee to be killed in a private plane crash.

After the series, Joe Torre declined a reduced-length and compensation contract offer from the Yankees and returned to the National League as manager of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;

During the off-season, the Yankees retooled their roster with several star free agent acquisitions, including [[CC Sabathia]], [[Mark Teixeira]], and [[A. J. Burnett]]. At the beginning of the [[2009 New York Yankees season|2009 season]], the Yankees opened the new [[Yankee Stadium]], located just a block north on River Avenue from their former home.

They swept the Minnesota Twins in the [[2010 American League Division Series]], but lost to the Texas Rangers in the [[2010 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], 4–2.

In a 22–9 win over the [[Oakland Athletics]]  on August 25, 2011, the Yankees became the first team in Major League history to hit three [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slams]] in a single game. They were hit by [[Robinson Canó]], [[Russell Martin]], and [[Curtis Granderson]]. The Yankees won the AL East title, finishing with 97 wins and took home field throughout the AL postseason. However, they were defeated by the Tigers, 3–2, in the [[2011 American League Division Series|ALDS]].

In 2012, the Yankees again finished the season with the AL's best record at 95–67. In mid-July, the Yankees traded two prospects to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for [[Ichiro Suzuki]]. They faced the Orioles in the [[2012 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. In Game 3, [[Raúl Ibañez]] became the oldest player to hit two home runs in a game, the oldest to hit a walk-off home run, the first substitute position player in a postseason game to hit two home runs, and the first to hit two home runs in the 9th inning or later in a postseason game, in the Yankees' 3–2 win. The Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games. However, in the [[2012 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Yankees lost to the Tigers again, this time in a four-game sweep, which was compounded with a struggling offense and a season-ending injury to [[Derek Jeter]].

The [[2013 New York Yankees season|2013 season]] was riddled with injuries. Mark Teixeira strained his elbow during the [[2013 World Baseball Classic|World Baseball Classic]] prior to the start of the season and played only 15 games for the Yankees. Alex Rodriguez played only 44 games after a hip surgery, Jeter played only 17 games due to his ankle injury from the 2012 ALCS, and Curtis Granderson played only 61 games due to forearm and knuckle injuries.

Through 2018, the Yankees have an all-time regular season winning percentage of .569 (a 10,275 – 7,781 record), the best of any team in MLB history.&lt;ref name=BestRecord&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/|title=Baseball Teams and Baseball Team Encyclopedias|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=July 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808123843/http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/|archive-date=August 8, 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2019, they set a new major league record for homering in 28 consecutive games, breaking the record set by the [[2002 Texas Rangers season|2002 Texas Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-set-record-homer-in-28-straight-games|title=Yanks HR in 28th straight for all-time MLB mark|work=MLB.com|access-date=June 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190625234147/https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-set-record-homer-in-28-straight-games|archive-date=June 25, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the walk-off solo home run by DJ LeMahieu to win the game against the Oakland Athletics on August 31, 2019, the Yankees ended the month of August that year now holding a new record of 74 home runs hit in the month alone, a new record for the most home runs hit in a month by a single MLB team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=21-41074406-4|title=The second HR of the game for Mike Ford, who has 8 homers and 14 RBI in 95 AB, increases the Yankees August home run total to 64, adding on to the all-time record for most HRs in a single month.|date=August 27, 2019|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-set-mlb-record-for-home-runs-in-a-month |title=Yanks break HR record, take 'rowdy' LA series |access-date=September 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826122629/https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-set-mlb-record-for-home-runs-in-a-month |archive-date=August 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Series championships==
The Yankees have won a record 27 World Series Championships. Their most recent one came when the new stadium opened in 2009; they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games under manager Joe Girardi.

==Team nicknames==
The "Yankees" name is often shortened to "the Yanks." Their most prominently used [[List of baseball nicknames|nickname]] is "the Bronx Bombers" or simply "the Bombers", a reference to their home and their prolific hitting. A less used nickname is "the Pinstripes", in reference to the iconic feature on their home uniforms. Critics often refer to the team and the organization as "the Evil Empire", a term applied to the Yankees by [[Boston Red Sox]] president [[Larry Lucchino]] in a 2002 interview with the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucchino fires shot at Yanks after losing out on pitcher|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/1226/1482493.html|publisher=ESPN|access-date=March 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522210924/http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/1226/1482493.html|archive-date=May 22, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A term from the team's tumultuous late 1970s, "the Bronx Zoo", is sometimes used by detractors, as well as the "Damn Yankees", after the [[Damn Yankees|musical of the same name]]. Ironically, even many Yankees ''supporters'' refer to their team as the "Evil Empire" as a badge of honor and in fact enjoy having their team play the villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.masslive.com/redsoxmonster/2013/02/the_new_york_yankees_evil_and.html|title=The New York Yankees are baseball's evil empire, and they're proud of it|last=Shapiro|first=Ben|date=February 23, 2013|website=masslive.com|access-date=March 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FreddySez.jpg|left|thumb|upright|"[[Freddy Schuman|Freddy Sez]]" holding one of his signs near the bleachers entrance before a game between the Yankees and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]]]
With their recurring success since the 1920s, the Yankees have since been one of the most popular teams in the world,&lt;ref name=brtop50&gt;{{cite web|last=Pumerantz|first=Zack|title=The 50 Most Popular Teams in Sports|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/979699-the-50-most-popular-teams-in-sports/page/50|work=The Bleacher Report|access-date=14 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116140157/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/979699-the-50-most-popular-teams-in-sports/page/50|archive-date=January 16, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their fan base coming from much further than the [[New York metropolitan area]]. The Yankees typically bring an upsurge in attendance at all or most of their various road-trip venues, drawing crowds of their own fans, as well as home-town fans whose interest is heightened when the Yankees come to town.

The first 1 million-fan season was in 1920, when 1,289,422 fans attended Yankee games at the [[Polo Grounds]]. The first 2 million-fan season was in 1946, when 2,265,512 fans attended the games at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees have beaten the league average for home attendance 83 out of the last 87 years (only during 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994 did they not accomplish this). In the past seven years, the Yankees have drawn over three million fans each year, with an American League record-setting 4,090,696 in 2005, becoming only the third franchise in sports history to draw over four million in regular-season attendance in their own ballpark.&lt;ref name=4million&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060702&amp;content_id=1535941&amp;vkey=pr_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|title=Yankees reach four million in tickets sales for second consecutive season|work=MLB.com|date=July 2, 2006|access-date=May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yankees were the league leaders in "road attendance" each year from 2001 through 2006.&lt;ref name=RoadAttendance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/attendance?sort=away_pct&amp;year=2006&amp;seasonType=2|title=MLB Attendance Report – 2006|publisher=ESPN|access-date=March 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009155655/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/attendance?sort=away_pct&amp;year=2006&amp;seasonType=2|archive-date=October 9, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous fan was [[Freddy Schuman]], popularly known as "'''Freddy Sez'''." For over 50 years, he came to the Yankees' home games with a baseball cap, a Yankees' jersey (which on the back bears his own name), and a cake pan with a [[shamrock]] painted on it, which was connected to a sign inscribed with words of encouragement for the home team. Schuman died on October 17, 2010, at the age of 85.

To avoid unwanted publicity, Yankees players use [[pseudonym|alias]]es when registering for hotels. ''[[The Village Voice]]'' published a list of aliases used by Yankees players, and the contents were republished on ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''.&lt;ref name=HotelNames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/1005071yankees1.html|title=Batting Third, Charlie Wattsizname|date=October 5, 2007|publisher=The Smoking Gun|access-date=March 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305030459/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/1005071yankees1.html|archive-date=March 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bleacher Creatures===
[[File:BleacherShirt.jpg|thumb|A shirt worn by a number of [[Bleacher Creatures]]]]
{{Main|Bleacher Creatures}}
The "Bleacher Creatures" are a notorious group of season ticket holders who occupied Section 39 in the right-field bleachers at the old Yankee Stadium and occupy Section 203 in the new one. They are known for their strict allegiance to the Yankees and are often merciless to opposing fans who sit in the section and cheer for the road team. They enjoy taunting the opposing team's right fielder with a series of chanting and slandering. The "creatures" got their nickname from ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist Filip "Flip" Bondy, who spent the 2004 season sitting in the section for research on his book about the group, ''Bleeding Pinstripes: A Season with the Bleacher Creatures of Yankee Stadium'', published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Filip|last=Bondy|title=Bleeding Pinstripes: A Season with the Bleacher Creatures of Yankee Stadium|location=New York|publisher=Sports Publishing|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Judge's Chambers at Yankee Stadium ===
In 2017, team management ordered the creation of a special cheer section within Section 104 for fans of Yankees outfielder [[Aaron Judge]], called "the Judge's Chambers". They were the second AL team to create a special cheering section, following the [[Seattle Mariners]]. The Judge's Chambers was added in response to his rise as one of the league's most popular young stars. The section's 18 seats are given to lucky ticketholders and their families, along with black judicial robes with the team logo on the front and Judge's 99 jersey number on the back; prior to the addition of the section, fans were wearing white wigs and judicial robes to games in support of Judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/aaron-judge-fans-wore-judge-costumes-to-yankee-stadium/c-229701442|title=The verdict is in: Aaron Judge's fan club members wore judge costumes to Yankee Stadium|date=May 11, 2017|publisher=Cut4|access-date=September 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903114912/https://www.mlb.com/cut4/aaron-judge-fans-wore-judge-costumes-to-yankee-stadium/c-229701442|archive-date=September 3, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, community organizations, charities and Little League teams are given precedence when selecting participants.

===Global expansion and business model===
The Yankees baseball club is formally owned by [[Yankee Global Enterprises]], which owns the team's regional YES sports network. The club has claimed that it is operating under annual losses in excess of $47 million, but this figure is attributed only to the ballclub's finances and not to finances attributed to YES or Yankees Global Enterprises.

The Yankees have become well known for a winning reputation on a global level. In 2007, they reached an agreement with the Chinese Baseball Association to allow coaches, scouts and trainers to work in China to promote baseball and judge talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070130&amp;content_id=1789369&amp;vkey=pr_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|title=New York Yankees and Chinese Baseball Association reach landmark agreement|publisher=MLB|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403010507/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20070130&amp;content_id=1789369&amp;vkey=pr_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|archive-date=April 3, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are trying to do the same with the [[Yomiuri Giants]] and the [[Hanshin Tigers]] in Japan. The Yankees and Yomiuri Giants currently have a close relationship and share ideas and strategies. The [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] daily newspaper has an ad on the left-field wall at Yankee Stadium, and other Japanese ads appear on the scrolling backstop advertising board. The Yankees are hoping that close ties with countries such as China and Japan will give them personal, in-depth judgments of baseball talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20021116&amp;content_id=178064&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|title=Yankees team with Yomiuri Giants|publisher=MLB|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403010516/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20021116&amp;content_id=178064&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|archive-date=April 3, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Yankees announced a joint venture with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] to form the basis for a partnership in running food and beverage, and other catering services to both teams' stadiums.
 
In 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked New York Yankees as the fourth most valuable sports team in the world, behind [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] of [[La Liga]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] of the [[Premier League]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] of La Liga, a value of $2.3 billion.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|title=Real Madrid Tops The World's Most Valuable Sports Teams|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/07/15/real-madrid-tops-the-worlds-most-valuable-sports-teams/|agency=Forbes|date=July 15, 2013|access-date=January 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224122446/http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/07/15/real-madrid-tops-the-worlds-most-valuable-sports-teams/|archive-date=February 24, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked the Yankees as the most valuable [[MLB teams|MLB team]] at $3.7 billion, up 9% from 2016, with the average MLB team worth $1.54 billion.

In 2019, [[Forbes]] magazine ranked the Yankees as the most valuable [[MLB teams|MLB team]] at $4.6 billion, up 15% from 2018, which is currently the 2nd most valuable sports franchise behind only the [[Dallas Cowboys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/07/22/the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2019/#30bbb717283d |title=The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams 2019 |access-date=July 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725232004/https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/07/22/the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2019/#30bbb717283d |archive-date=July 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
With the long-term success of the franchise and a large Yankee fanbase, many fans of other teams have come to dislike the Yankees.&lt;ref name="suck"&gt;

==Fight and theme songs==
[[File:Yankee Stadium Grounds Crew Performing YMCA on 8-14-16.jpeg|thumb|The grounds crew at Yankee Stadium dancing to "[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]"]]
The official fight song for the Yankees is "[[Here Come the Yankees]]", written in 1967 by Bob Bundin and Lou Stallman. While it is not used as often, it is still heard frequently in instrumental form, most prominently in radio broadcasts, until 1990 it was played as the theme for television broadcasts in several versions. Another song strongly linked to the team is "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]", which is played in the stadium after home games. The [[Frank Sinatra]] cover version is traditionally played after victories, and the [[Liza Minnelli]] original version after losses. However, due to a complaint from Minnelli, regardless of the result of the game played in the stadium it is the Sinatra version that is played to close it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/19673/quick-10-10-facts-about-yankee-stadium |title=10 Facts About Yankee Stadium |publisher=Mentalfloss.com |date=2008-09-23 |access-date=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Yankees take the field before the start of every game, [[2 Unlimited]]'s "[[Get Ready For This]]" is played, with the fans usually clapping along. When the Yankees score a run at home, a short snippet of 2 Unlimited's "[[Workaholic (song)|Workaholic]]" containing the bell chime of [[Westminster Quarters]] is played (whenever Aaron Judge scores a run the snippet is replaced by with "The Clang" tone by veteran composer [[Mike Post]], used in the ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' franchise).

A wide selection of songs are played regularly at the stadium, many of them live on the Stadium's Hammond organ. "[[God Bless America]]" has been played during the 7th inning stretch since [[September 11 attacks|September 11]]. The version typically played for many years since 2001 was an abbreviated version of [[Kate Smith]]'s rendition. However, during many important games (including most play-off games) and on noteworthy days, it is sung live [[a cappella]] and includes a longer introduction, in 2019 the tradition of playing her version officially ended due to racial controversy involving Smith and the tune is now played live by the [[stadium organist]] during the stretch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/ny-kate-smith-god-bless-america-20190418-wfkyednrvrherh57sfmb4h7s5y-story.html|title=Yankees dump Kate Smith's 'God Bless America' from rotation over singer's racist songs|website=New York Daily News|access-date=May 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501093045/https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/ny-kate-smith-god-bless-america-20190418-wfkyednrvrherh57sfmb4h7s5y-story.html|archive-date=May 1, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 5th inning, the grounds crew, while performing their duties, dance to "[[Y.M.C.A.

On the DiamondVision screen, a man in farmer's garb is shown dancing in the stadium's control room, with the words "Cotton-Eyed Joey" at the bottom. The organist will sometimes play the "[[Zorbas|Zorba the Greek Theme]]", accompanied by clapping from the audience, to excite the crowd and encourage a rally.

The [[YES Network|Yankees Entertainment and Sports (YES) Network]] was launched in 2002 and serves as the primary home of the New York Yankees. [[Michael Kay (announcer)|Michael Kay]] is the play-by-play announcer with [[Ken Singleton]], [[David Cone]], [[Al Leiter]], [[John Flaherty]], and [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] working as commentators as part of a three-man, or occasionally two-man, booth. [[Bob Lorenz]] hosts the pre-game show and the post-game show with [[Jack Curry]], and [[Meredith Marakovits]] and [[Nancy Newman]] are the on-site reporters. Some games are telecast on [[WPIX]] and formerly on [[WWOR-TV]]; those broadcasts are produced by YES.

Radio broadcasts are on the [[Yankees Radio Network]], the flagship station being [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]] 660 AM, with [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]] as the play-by-play announcer and [[Suzyn Waldman]] providing the commentary, with Spanish-language broadcasts on [[WADO]] 1280 AM.

The history of Yankee radio broadcasters is: [[WABC (AM)|WJZ 770]] (1939–'40), [[WOR (AM)|WOR 710]] (1942), [[WINS (AM)|WINS 1010]] (1944–'57), [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM 1050]] (1958–'60), [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS 880]] (1961–'66), [[WEPN (AM)|WHN 1050]] (1967–'70), [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA 570]] (1971–'77), WINS 1010 (1978–'80), WABC 770 (1981–2001), WCBS 880 (2002–2013), [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN 660 AM]] and [[WFAN-FM|WFAN-FM 101.9]] (2014–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/11/new-york-yankees-ink-multi-year-broadcast-deal-with-wfan-am-fm/ |title=New York Yankees Ink Multi-Year Broadcast Deal With WFAN AM &amp; FM |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=September 11, 2013 |access-date=October 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016141317/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/11/new-york-yankees-ink-multi-year-broadcast-deal-with-wfan-am-fm/ |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past announcers===
*[[Mel Allen]] was the team's lead announcer from 1948 to 1964. He was known as "The voice of the Yankees."
*[[Russ Hodges]] had a brief stint with Mel Allen before he took over as the lead announcer with the New York Giants.
*[[Red Barber]] called Yankees games for 13 seasons (1954–1966).
*[[Jerry Coleman]] called Yankees games from 1963 to 1970.
*[[Joe Garagiola]] called Yankees games from 1965 to 1967.
*[[Frank Messer]], [[Phil Rizzuto]] and [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] teamed together in the 1970s and 1980s. Rizzuto, with 40 years in the broadcast booth, was the longest-serving broadcaster in the history of the club. Messer and White each worked nearly two decades for the Yankees, with White notably moving on to become president of the [[National League]] in 1989. [[Bobby Murcer]] also called games for over twenty years, and continued with the YES Network until shortly before his death from [[brain cancer]].

The retired numbers were displayed behind the old [[Yankee Stadium]]'s left-field fence and in front of the opposing team's bullpen, forming a little alley that connects [[Monument Park (Yankee Stadium)|Monument Park]] to the left-field stands. When the franchise moved across the street to the new stadium, the numbers were incorporated into Monument Park that sits place in center field between both bullpens. The 21 numbers are placed on the wall in chronological order, beginning with [[Lou Gehrig]]'s number 4. This was retired soon after Gehrig left baseball on July 4, 1939, the same day he gave his famous farewell speech. His was the first number retired in [[Major League Baseball]] history. Beneath the numbers are plaques with the names of the players and a descriptive paragraph.

[[File:YankeeRetiredNumbers.jpg|thumb|right|The first four in the row of retired numbers at the old Yankee Stadium]]
The number 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball in honor of [[Jackie Robinson]] on April 15, 1997, the 50th anniversary of his breaking the [[baseball color line|color barrier]]. The day was declared [[Jackie Robinson Day]], and was later observed by all of baseball, with select players from every team wearing the number 42. Players who wore No. 42 at the time were allowed to continue to wear it until they left the team with which they played on April 15, 1997; [[Mariano Rivera]] was the last active player covered under that [[grandfather clause]]. While other teams placed the number 42 with the rest of their retired numbers, the Yankees did not do so at first. Ten years later, on April 17, 2007, the Yankees honored Robinson by mounting the logo of Jackie Robinson Day with a corresponding plaque alongside the rest of the retired numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070418&amp;content_id=1916505&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|title=Yankees retire Jackie Robinson's number|work=New York Yankees|access-date=May 11, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622155211/http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070418&amp;content_id=1916505&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|archive-date=June 22, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Yankees were finishing a roadtrip in Oakland on Jackie Robinson Day, the ceremony took place two days later. When the Yankees moved to the second Yankee Stadium, they replaced the Jackie Robinson Day logo with a number 42 that resembled the other retired numbers. Later on they replaced the number 42 so that it resembled the Dodger's style, and on September 22, 2013, a plaque was dedicated to Robinson in Monument Park. Also, the number 42 dedicated to Robinson was removed entirely and replaced with one for Mariano Rivera.

In 1972, the number 8 was retired for two players on the same day, in honor of catcher [[Bill Dickey]] and his protege, catcher [[Yogi Berra]]. Berra inherited Dickey's number in 1948 after Dickey ended his playing career and became a coach.

[[Billy Martin]] is the only Yankee to have his number retired as a player/manager combination. He wore number 1 as a player in the 1950s and as a manager in the 1970s and 1980s.

The numbers 37 and 6, retired for [[Casey Stengel]] and [[Joe Torre]] respectively, are the only numbers retired by the Yankees for someone who served solely as manager of the team. Stengel managed the Yankees to ten pennants and seven world championships between 1949 and 1960, including a record five consecutive world championships from 1949 through 1953. Joe Torre managed the Yankees from 1996 to 2007, winning six pennants and four World Series championships.

On May 14, 2017, the Yankees retired number 2 in honor of Derek Jeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://m.mlb.com/video/v1214974983/yankees-will-retire-jeters-no-2-in-2017 |title=Jeter to have number retired &amp;#124; 12/06/2016 |access-date=March 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326051407/http://m.mlb.com/video/v1214974983/yankees-will-retire-jeters-no-2-in-2017 |archive-date=March 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves 0, which the Yankees have previously never issued, as the only single-digit number available for future Yankees. In 2019 the team signed [[Adam Ottavino]] and issued him the number 0, which he previously wore as a member of the [[Colorado Rockies]].

At least two Yankees numbers have not been formally retired, but have been kept out of circulation.  The New York Yankees have not re-issued [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]]'s #21 since he ended his career at the end of 2001, except for a brief period of a few days in 2008 when [[Morgan Ensberg]] and then [[LaTroy Hawkins]] wore #21, before fan complaints led Hawkins to change his number to #22 in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pinstripealley.com/yankees-editorials-opinions-analysis/2015/2/26/8111453/yankees-retired-number-paul-oneill-21 |title=The Yankees need to reissue Paul O'Neill's no. 21 |first=Jason |last=Cohen |date=February 26, 2015 |work=Pinstripe Alley |access-date=May 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531225732/https://www.pinstripealley.com/yankees-editorials-opinions-analysis/2015/2/26/8111453/yankees-retired-number-paul-oneill-21 |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Yankees have held [[Alex Rodriguez]]'s #13 out of circulation since his retirement in 2016.
