He graduated in 1996 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in English.&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/John-Cho-rises-to-the-top-with-Harold-s-help-3217677.php|title=John Cho rises to the top, with Harold's help|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|date=2008-04-23|website=SFGate|access-date=2020-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reunions.berkeley.edu/spotlight/john-cho|title=John Cho|last=Varian|first=Maya Felipa|date=2016-10-11|website=Cal Reunions|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Career ==
After graduation, Cho taught English at [[Pacific Hills School]] in [[West Hollywood, California]], while acting at [[East West Players]] in downtown [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Kevin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt; There, he appeared in Edward Sakamoto's ''The Taste of Kona Coffee'' in 1996 and in Euijoon Kim's movie ''My Tired Broke Ass Pontificating Slapstick Funk'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwestplayers.org/about_us/production_history/mybrokeass.htm EWP 34th Season] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114333/http://www.eastwestplayers.org/about_us/production_history/mybrokeass.htm |date=2011-04-06 }} on [[East West Players]] site&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho gained attention with a small role as "MILF Guy #2" in the 1999 comedy ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', in which he popularized the slang term [[MILF (slang)|MILF]].&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt; Cho reprised the role in three sequels: ''[[American Pie 2]]'', ''[[American Wedding]]'', and the latest installment ''[[American Reunion]]'' in which he has a much larger role. His character initially had no name but he was given the name "John" in the third film, named after Cho himself.

Cho guest-starred on ''[[Charmed]]'' as a [[Dead Man Dating|ghost]] in 1998 and was one of the stars of the short-lived situation comedy ''[[Off Centre]]'' from 2001 to 2002. He was a costar on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[Kitchen Confidential (TV series)|Kitchen Confidential]]'' based on [[Anthony Bourdain]]'s [[Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly|best-selling book]]. He had supporting roles in the [[science fiction|sci-fi]] comedy ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'' directed by [[Ivan Reitman]], ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'' starring [[Chris Rock]], and ''[[Bowfinger]]'' with [[Steve Martin]].

In 2002, Cho had a starring role in the ensemble cast of [[Justin Lin]]'s ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'', a drama focusing on the travails of a group of [[Asian American]]s living in Southern California who are academically successful but socially discontented, and as a result engage in wantonly violent, criminal behavior. It was well received by critics, with Elvis Mitchell of the ''New York Times'' describing Cho's character's "lazy magnetism of which he is charmingly aware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/movies/film-review-teenagers-determined-to-damage-their-resumes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Film Review; Teenages Determined to Damage Their Resumes |first=Elvis |last=Mitchell |access-date=26 August 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=2003-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the movie ''[[Big Fat Liar]]'' was released, in which Cho played a Hong Kong-based movie director. He refused to do the accent scripted for his character. The director worked with him to re-develop the role.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Gail (October 9, 2014), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/09/john-cho-of-selfie-wants-roles-outside-any-asian-stereotype-2/ "John Cho of 'Selfie': 'I experienced racism'"]. The Washington Post. Retrieved June 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho had a successful starring role as Harold Lee in 2004's ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle]]'' and reprised the role in 2008's ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'' which raked in $38{{nbsp}}million at the theaters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haroldandkumar2.htm |title=Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay |website=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2011's ''[[A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas]]'' which made $35{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haroldandkumar3.htm |title=A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas |publisher=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cho's role in the popular franchise was written specifically for him by [[Hayden Schlossberg]], and Cho has recounted that when Schlossberg first approached him with the role, he was initially suspicious.&lt;ref name="Kevin" /&gt;

Cho appeared on July 2004 issue of ''[[KoreAm Journal]]'' and in September 2006 was cast in NBC's new comedy ''[[The Singles Table]]'', but the series never aired due to changes in scheduling and production. In 2006 and again in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.com/celebrity/the-sexiest-men-alive-2009/ People Magazine Sexiest Men Alive 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Cho was selected as one of the sexiest men alive in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine.

In 2007, Cho was added to the cast of ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' as a recurring character. Cho plays Kenny, a best friend of accountant [[Henry Grubstick]] (played by [[Christopher Gorham]]).

Cho appeared in [[Nas]]'s "[[Be a Nigger Too]]" music video along with various celebrities, and had a guest appearance on the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', in the episode "[[I'm Not That Guy]]" where he played a partner in an evil law firm. Of the latter, Staci Krause of [[IGN]], wrote that Cho was "the scene stealer in this episode" and that she would "definitely like to see more of him" in the series.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=IGN |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/30/how-i-met-your-mother-im-not-that-guy-review |title=How I Met Your Mother: 'I'm Not That Guy' Review |date=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2010, Cho starred in the television series ''[[FlashForward]]'' as FBI Special Agent [[Demetri Noh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Fall-TV-ABC-1006175.aspx |title=Fall TV: ABC's Official Schedule Revisits V, Moves Betty and Says Adieu to Who? |first=Joyce |last=Eng |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His character was originally slated to be killed off during what turned out to be the show's only season, but after his turn as Sulu in ''Star Trek'' boosted his popularity, the producers revised the show's storyline so that he survived, in an attempt to boost declining ratings.&lt;ref name="FlashForward Keck"&gt;{{cite web |last=Keck |first=William |author-link=William Keck |title=Keck's Exclusives: Gabrielle Union FlashForwards to New Series |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kecks-Exclusives-Gabrielle-1019728.aspx |work=TV Guide |date=June 18, 2010 |access-date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho has indicated he has found freedom in being Harold in the ''Harold and Kumar'' films because the stoner character goes against the grain of Asian Americans onscreen.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He has said he has experienced racism throughout his career in Hollywood and that he tries to take roles that do not perpetuate Asian stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/09/28/352046466/selfie-s-choice-john-cho-gets-an-unlikely-shot-as-a-romantic-lead|title=In 'Selfie', John Cho Gets An Unlikely Shot As A Romantic Lead|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to do an Asian accent for ''Big Fat Liar'', Cho refused.

"Asians narratively in shows are insignificant. They're the cop, or waitress, or whatever it is. You see them in the background. So to be in this position ... is bit of a landmark," he has said on the inability of Asians getting offered such roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victoria-namkung/tvs-first-asian-romantic-lead_b_5878380.html|title=Will John Cho Be Television's First Asian Romantic Lead?|website=The Huffington Post|date=25 September 2014|access-date=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wong|first=Tony|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2014/07/16/star_treks_john_cho_breaks_barriers_as_romantic_lead_i_would_call_this_revolutionary.html|title="Asians narratively in shows are insignificant," says John Cho, the romantic lead in the fall series Selfie.

In 2016, Cho was the face of the "#StarringJohnCho" social movement and hashtag campaign, created by William Yu, wherein Cho is Photoshopped onto existing movie posters as the male lead. The purpose of the project was to call attention to the lack of opportunities for Asian American actors in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=#STARRINGJOHNCHO|url=http://starringjohncho.com/|access-date=2020-08-27|website=#STARRINGJOHNCHO|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho supported the 2012 re-election campaign of Democratic U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="hollywooddonors"&gt;(2011-07-16) {{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59184.html|title=Hollywood stars open wallets for Obama|access-date=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
