===2005–2013: Documentaries, thrillers and film series===
2005 was a busy year for Freeman, making six appearances in various features. In the drama ''[[An Unfinished Life]],'' Freeman plays Mitch, a neighbor of a Wyoming rancher (Robert Redford). The film had a mixed response; ''[[The Guardian]]'' critic thought it was amiable but questioned the purpose of Freeman's "sidekick" role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Brooks|first=Xan|date=2006-06-16|title=An Unfinished Life|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/16/drama|access-date=2020-07-26|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726180809/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/16/drama|archive-date=July 26, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman's authoritative voice led to his narration of two documentaries; Steven Spielberg's ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' and the Academy Award-winning ''[[March of the Penguins]]''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He also appeared in [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the first installment in what would become ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'', as the fictional [[Lucius Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=2005-06-15|title=Dark Was the Young Knight Battling His Inner Demons|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/movies/dark-was-the-young-knight-battling-his-inner-demons.html|access-date=2020-07-31|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617083513/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/movies/dark-was-the-young-knight-battling-his-inner-demons.html|archive-date=June 17, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, he co-starred with [[Jet Li]] in the action-thriller ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed]],'' playing Sam, a blind piano tuner who helps Li's character turn his life around.
