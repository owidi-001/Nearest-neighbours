'''Human evolution''' is the [[evolution]]ary process within the [[Primate evolution|history]] of [[primate]]s that led to the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a distinct species of the [[hominid]] family, which includes the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|human bipedalism]] and [[language]],&lt;ref name="HallHallgrímsson2011c"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brian K.

The study of human evolution involves [[consilience|several]] scientific disciplines, including [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], [[primatology]], [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[neurobiology]], [[ethology]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[embryology]] and [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heng |first=Henry H.Q. |date=May 2009 |title=The genome-centric concept: resynthesis of evolutionary theory |journal=[[BioEssays]] |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=512–525 |doi=10.1002/bies.200800182 |issn=0265-9247 |pmid=19334004|s2cid=1336952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other [[mammal]]s about {{Mya|85}}, in the [[Late Cretaceous]] period, and the earliest [[fossil]]s appear in the [[Paleocene]], around {{Mya|55}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/meet-your-ancestors.html |title=Meet Your Ancestors |last=Tyson |first=Peter |date=July 1, 2008 |work=[[Nova ScienceNow]] |publisher=PBS; [[WGBH Educational Foundation]] |access-date=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the superfamily [[Hominoidea]], the family Hominidae diverged from the family [[Hylobatidae]] some 15–20&amp;nbsp;million years ago; subfamily [[Homininae]] (African apes) diverged from [[Ponginae]] ([[orangutan]]s{{efn|Ponginae is not to be confused with [[Pongidae]], an obsolete family which grouped together orangutans, gorillas and chimps, to separate them from humans.}}) about 14&amp;nbsp;million years ago; the tribe Hominini (including humans, ''Australopithecus'', and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s) parted from the tribe [[Gorillini]] (gorillas) between 8–9&amp;nbsp;million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes [[Hominina]] (humans and extinct biped ancestors) and [[Panina]] ([[chimpanzee]]s) separated 4–7&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="Max Planck 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|2012}}

==Anatomical changes==
[[File:Ape skeletons.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Ape|hominoids]] are descendants of a [[common descent|common ancestor]]]]
Human evolution from its first separation from the [[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees]] is characterized by a number of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[Human development (biology)|developmental]], [[Human physiology|physiological]], and [[Human behavior|behavioral]] changes. The most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism, increased brain size, lengthened [[ontogeny]] (gestation and infancy), and decreased [[sexual dimorphism]]. The relationship between these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|Silk|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a [[Thumb#Grips|power and precision grip]], a change first occurring in ''[[Homo erectus|H. erectus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brues|Snow|1965|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9WemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1–39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipedalism===
[[Bipedal]]ism is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''&lt;ref name="Brunet2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunet |first1=Michel |author-link1=Michel Brunet (paleontologist) |last2=Guy |first2=Franck |last3=Pilbeam |first3=David |author-link3=David Pilbeam |last4=Mackaye |first4=H. |last5=Likius |first5=A. |last6=Ahounta |first6=D. |last7=Beauvilain |first7=A. |last8=Blondel |first8=C. |last9=Bocherens |first9=H. |last10=Boisserie |first10=J. |last11=De Bonis |first11=L. |last12=Coppens |first12=Y. |last13=Dejax |first13=J. |last14=Denys |first14=C. |last15=Duringer |first15=P. |last16=Eisenmann |first16=V. |last17=Fanone |first17=G. |last18=Fronty |first18=P. |last19=Geraads |first19=D. |last20=Lehmann |first20=T. |last21=Lihoreau |first21=F. |last22=Louchart |first22=A. |last23=Mahamat |first23=A. |last24=Merceron |first24=G. |last25=Mouchelin |first25=G. |last26=Otero |first26=O. |last27=Pelaez Campomanes |first27=P. |last28=Ponce De Leon |first28=M. |last29=Rage |first29=J. |last30=Sapanet |first30=M. |last31=Schuster |first31=M. |last32=Sudre |first32=J. |last33=Tassy |first33=P. |last34=Valentin |first34=X. |last35=Vignaud |first35=P. |last36=Viriot |first36=L. |last37=Zazzo |first37=A. |last38=Zollikofer |first38=C. |display-authors=3 |date=July 11, 2002 |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1038/nature00879 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=12110880|bibcode=2002Natur.418..145B |s2cid=1316969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Orrorin]]'', both of which arose some 6 to 7&amp;nbsp;million years ago. The non-bipedal knuckle-walkers, the gorillas and chimpanzees, diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same time, so either ''Sahelanthropus'' or ''Orrorin'' may be our [[Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor|last shared ancestor]]. ''[[Ardipithecus]]'', a full biped, arose approximately 5.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1175802 |pmid=19810190 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the Paleobiology of Early Hominids |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5949 |pages=75–86 |year=2009 |last1=White |first1=T.

The early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still later into the genus ''Homo''. There are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion,&lt;ref name="Kwang Hyun 2015 929–934"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwang Hyun|first=Ko|date=2015|title=Origins of Bipedalism |journal=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology|doi=10.1590/S1516-89132015060399|volume=58|issue=6|pages=929–934|arxiv=1508.02739|bibcode=2015arXiv150802739K|s2cid=761213}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled long-distance running and hunting, provided an enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the East African Rift Valley uplift versus the previous closed forest habitat.&lt;ref name="DeSalleTattersall2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwang Hyun 2015 929–934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2008 Child of Earth" /&gt; A 2007 study provides support for the hypothesis that walking on two legs, or bipedalism, evolved because it used less energy than quadrupedal knuckle-walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 17, 2007 |title=Study Identifies Energy Efficiency As Reason For Evolution Of Upright Walking |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070716191140.htm |work=[[Science Daily|ScienceDaily]] |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |access-date=April 9, 2015}}

Another change is the shape of the big toe. Recent studies suggest that australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe. This was progressively lost in habilines.

Anatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]], feet and ankles, and skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aiello|Dean|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[femur]] evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the [[lumbar vertebrae]] became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run. The [[foramen magnum]] migrated under the skull and more anterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondo|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region, where the long downward facing [[Ilium (bone)|iliac blade]] was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while walking;&lt;ref name="Srivastava2009" /&gt; bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this. A drawback is that the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans, permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion, since further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strickberger|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=feMItLo5gwgC&amp;pg=PA476 475–476]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trevathan|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Potlqpl-jxgC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater [[neoteny]], compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age.&lt;ref name="Curry2008 Child of Earth"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|2008|pp=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a major effect upon the female reproductive cycle,&lt;ref&gt;Zuk, Marlene (2014), "Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us About Sex, Diet, and How We Live" (W.W. Norton &amp; Company)&lt;/ref&gt; and the more frequent appearance of [[alloparenting]] in humans when compared with other hominids.&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy, Sarah Blaffer (2011), "Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding" (Harvard Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed human sexual maturity also led to the evolution of [[menopause]] with one explanation providing that elderly women could better pass on their genes by taking care of their daughter's offspring, as compared to having more children of their own.&lt;ref name="Wayman_Sciencenews"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wayman |first=Erin |date=August 19, 2013 |title=Killer whales, grandmas and what men want: Evolutionary biologists consider menopause |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-grandmas-and-what-men-want-evolutionary-biologists-consider-menopause |journal=[[Science News]] |issn=0036-8423 |access-date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encephalization===

[[File:Brain size and tooth size in hominins.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Brain size and tooth size in hominins]]
The human species eventually developed a much larger brain than that of other primates—typically {{convert|1330|cm3|abbr=on}} in modern humans, nearly three times the size of a chimpanzee or gorilla brain.&lt;ref name="Schoeneman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoenemann |first=P.

This evolution continued in ''Homo erectus'' with {{convert|800–1,100|cm3|abbr=on}}, and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with {{convert|1200–1,900|cm3|abbr=on}}, larger even than modern ''Homo sapiens''. This brain increase manifested during postnatal [[neural development|brain growth]], far exceeding that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]). It also allowed for extended periods of [[Observational learning|social learning]] and [[language acquisition]] in juvenile humans, beginning as much as 2&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

The increase in volume of the [[neocortex]] also included a rapid increase in size of the [[cerebellum]]. Its function has traditionally been associated with balance and fine motor control, but more recently with [[speech]] and [[cognition]]. The great apes, including hominids, had a more pronounced cerebellum relative to the neocortex than other primates. It has been suggested that because of its function of sensory-motor control and learning complex muscular actions, the cerebellum may have underpinned human technological adaptations, including the preconditions of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barton |first1=Robert A. |last2=Venditti |first2=Chris |date=October 20, 2014 |title=Rapid Evolution of the Cerebellum in Humans and Other Great Apes |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=2440–2444 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.056 |pmid=25283776 |s2cid=5041106 |issn=0960-9822|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Starowicz-Filip |first1=Anna |last2=Milczarek |first2=Olga |last3=Kwiatkowski |first3=Stanisław |last4=Bętkowska-Korpała |first4=Barbara |last5=Prochwicz |first5=Katarzyna |display-authors=3 |year=2013 |title=Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome CCAS – a case report |journal=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=57–64 |oclc=220954272|doi=10.12740/APP/18666 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Feng Yu |author2=Qing-jun Jiang |author3=Xi-yan Sun |author4=Rong-wei Zhang |display-authors=3 |date=August 22, 2014 |title=A new case of complete primary cerebellar agenesis: clinical and imaging findings in a living patient |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |doi=10.1093/brain/awu239 |issn=1460-2156 |pmid=25149410 |volume=138 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=e353 |pmc=4614135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Anne H. |date=March 8, 2005 |title=Reciprocal evolution of the cerebellum and neocortex in fossil humans |journal=Proc.

The immediate survival advantage of encephalization is difficult to discern, as the major brain changes from ''Homo erectus'' to ''Homo heidelbergensis'' were not accompanied by major changes in technology.

===Sexual dimorphism===
The reduced degree of [[sexual dimorphism in humans]] is visible primarily in the reduction of the male [[canine tooth]] relative to other ape species (except [[gibbon]]s) and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[Concealed ovulation|hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only hominoids in which the female is fertile year round and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as genital swelling or overt changes in proceptivity during estrus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Nancy Makepeace|author2=Tanner|title=On Becoming Human|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j45AAAAIAAJ|year=1981|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28028-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_j45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 202]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 15% larger than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Reno |first1=Philip L. |last2=Lovejoy |first2=C.

{{main|Archaic humans}}

===Before Darwin===
The word ''homo'', the name of the biological genus to which humans belong, is [[Latin]] for "human".{{efn|The Latin word which refers to adult 
males only is "vir"}} It was chosen originally by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his classification system.{{efn|See the [[Binomial nomenclature]] and [[Systema Naturae]] articles.}} The word "human" is from the Latin ''humanus'', the adjectival form of ''homo''. The Latin "homo" derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''dhghem'', or "earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage Dictionaries (editors)|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Anatomy|anatomical]] similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/history_05|title=Nested Hierarchies, the Order of Nature: Carolus Linnaeus|work=Understanding Evolution: The History of Evolutionary Thought|publisher=The University of California at Berkeley|access-date=August 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin===
The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Darwin | first = Charles | year = 1859 | title = On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition= [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf Full image view] 1st | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=506 | bibcode = 1872Natur...5..318B | volume = 5 | journal = Nature | doi = 10.1038/005318a0 | issue = 121 | pages = 367–404 | pmid = 30164232 | pmc = 5184128 | s2cid = 4042779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]]. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. Many of Darwin's early supporters (such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Charles Lyell]]) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by [[natural selection]], though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and [[sexual selection]] to humans in his 1871 book ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First fossils===
A major problem in the 19th century was the lack of [[Transitional fossil|fossil intermediaries]]. Neanderthal remains were discovered in a limestone quarry in 1856, three years before the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'', and Neanderthal fossils had been discovered in Gibraltar even earlier, but it was originally claimed that these were the remains of a modern human who had suffered some kind of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Montgomery|1988|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 1891 discovery by [[Eugène Dubois]] of what is now called ''Homo erectus'' at [[Trinil]], [[Java]], it was only in the 1920s when such fossils were discovered in Africa, that intermediate species began to accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shipman|first1=Pat|last2=Storm|first2=Paul|date=2002|title=Missing links: Eugène Dubois and the origins of paleoanthropology|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|volume=11|issue=3|pages=108–116|doi=10.1002/evan.10021|s2cid=84889438|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, [[Raymond Dart]] described ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dart |first=Raymond |author-link=Raymond Dart |date=February 7, 1925 |title=''Australopithecus africanus'': The Man-Ape of South Africa |journal=Nature |volume=115 |issue=2884 |pages=195–199 |doi=10.1038/115195a0 |issn=0028-0836 |bibcode=1925Natur.115..195D |s2cid=4142569 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] was the [[Taung Child]], an australopithecine infant which was discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and an [[endocast]] of the brain.

Although the brain was small (410&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen showed short [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], and the position of the [[foramen magnum]] (the hole in the skull where the spine enters) was evidence of [[bipedal]] locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung Child was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.

===The East African fossils===
[[File:Fossil hominids.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evolution display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, US.]]
During the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of fossils were found in East Africa in the regions of the [[Olduvai Gorge]] and [[Lake Turkana]]. These searches were carried out by the Leakey family, with [[Louis Leakey]] and his wife [[Mary Leakey]], and later their son [[Richard Leakey|Richard]] and daughter-in-law [[Meave Leakey|Meave]], fossil hunters and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]]. From the fossil beds of Olduvai and Lake Turkana they amassed specimens of the early hominins: the [[australopithecines]] and ''Homo'' species, and even ''Homo erectus''.

These finds cemented Africa as the cradle of humankind. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, [[Ethiopia]] emerged as the new hot spot of [[paleoanthropology]] after [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|"Lucy"]], the most complete fossil member of the species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', was found in 1974 by [[Donald Johanson]] near [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]] in the desertic [[Afar Triangle]] region of northern Ethiopia. Although the specimen had a small brain, the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of modern humans, showing with certainty that these hominins had walked erect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=20–22, 184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy was classified as a new species, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', which is thought to be more closely related to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' as a direct ancestor, or as a close relative of an unknown ancestor, than any other known hominid or hominin from this early time range; ''see'' [[Hominidae|terms "hominid" and "hominin"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Human Lineage | author=Cartmill, Matt |author2=Fred H.

===The genetic revolution===

The genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when [[Vincent Sarich]] and [[Allan Wilson]] measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions of [[Serum (blood)|blood serum]] [[albumin]] between pairs of creatures, including humans and African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas).&lt;ref name="MolClock"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sarich |first1=V.M. |last2=Wilson |first2=A.C. |title=Immunological time scale for hominid evolution |journal=Science |volume=158 |issue=3805 |pages=1200–1204 |year=1967 |pmid=4964406 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3805.1200 |bibcode=1967Sci...158.1200S|s2cid=7349579 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an immunological distance, which was in turn proportional to the number of [[amino acid]] differences between homologous proteins in different species. By constructing a calibration curve of the ID of species' pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record, the data could be used as a [[molecular clock]] to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records.

In their seminal 1967 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago,&lt;ref name=MolClock/&gt; at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30&amp;nbsp;million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably "Lucy", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably ''[[Sivapithecus|Ramapithecus]]'', showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method.

Progress in [[DNA sequencing]], specifically [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and then [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome DNA]] (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|M'charek|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-K436zeUY8C&amp;pg=PA96 96]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeSalleTattersall2008"&gt;{{harvnb|DeSalle|Tattersall|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf4Sitw7YaIC&amp;pg=PA146 146]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trent|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=772BEp8ZyMYC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of the [[molecular clock]] principle revolutionized the study of [[molecular evolution]].

On the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10 and 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago, earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were about 76 mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children from their parents; this evidence supported the divergence time between hominins and chimpanzees noted above. However, a 2012 study in Iceland of 78 children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36 mutations per generation; this datum extends the separation between humans and chimpanzees to an earlier period greater than 7&amp;nbsp;million years ago ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]). Additional research with 226 offspring of wild chimpanzee populations in eight locations suggests that chimpanzees reproduce at age 26.5 years on average; which suggests the human divergence from chimpanzees occurred between 7 and 13&amp;nbsp;million years ago. And these data suggest that ''Ardipithecus'' (4.5 Ma), ''Orrorin'' (6 Ma) and ''Sahelanthropus'' (7 Ma) all may be on the hominid [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]], and even that the separation may have occurred outside the [[East African Rift]] region.

Furthermore, analysis of the two species' genes in 2006 provides evidence that after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees, interspecies mating between "proto-human" and "proto-chimpanzees" nonetheless occurred regularly enough to change certain genes in the new [[gene pool]]:
: A new comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes suggests that after the two lineages separated, they may have begun interbreeding... A principal finding is that the [[X chromosome]]s of humans and chimpanzees appear to have [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] about 1.2&amp;nbsp;million years more recently than the other chromosomes.
The research suggests:
: There were in fact two splits between the human and chimpanzee lineages, with the first being followed by interbreeding between the two populations and then a second split. The suggestion of a hybridization has startled [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]], who nonetheless are treating the new genetic data seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |author-link=Nicholas Wade |date=May 18, 2006 |title=Two Splits Between Human and Chimp Lines Suggested |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/science/18evolve.html |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The quest for the earliest hominin===
In the 1990s, several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout Africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the hominin lineage from the great apes. In 1994, Meave Leakey discovered ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]''. The find was overshadowed by Tim D. White's 1995 discovery of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'', which pushed back the fossil record to {{ma|4.2}}.

In 2000, [[Martin Pickford]] and Brigitte Senut discovered, in the [[Tugen Hills]] of [[Kenya]], a 6-million-year-old bipedal hominin which they named ''[[Orrorin]] tugenensis''. And in 2001, a team led by [[Michel Brunet (paleontologist)|Michel Brunet]] discovered the skull of ''[[Sahelanthropus]] tchadensis'' which was dated as {{ma|7.2|million years ago}}, and which Brunet argued was a bipedal, and therefore a hominid—that is, a hominin ({{lang|la|{{abbr|cf|confer}}}} Hominidae; [[Hominidae|terms "hominids" and hominins]]).

Anthropologists in the 1980s were divided regarding some details of reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the genus ''Homo''. Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues. According to the [[Sahara pump theory]] evidence suggests that the genus ''Homo'' have migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. ''Homo erectus'', ''Homo heidelbergensis'' and two or three times for ''Homo sapiens''). Recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. deMenocal, (2016) "Climate Shocks" (Scientific American Vol 25, No 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence suggests that humans may have left Africa half a million years earlier than previously thought. A joint Franco-Indian team has found human artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years. This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus ''Homo'' at [[Dmanisi]], in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], dating to 1.85&amp;nbsp;million years. Although controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that humans used tools as far back as 2.48&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Barras, Colin (2016), "Stone Tools hint humans reached Asia much earlier" (New Scientist February 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the Asian "Chopper" tool tradition, found in Java and northern China may have left Africa before the appearance of the [[Acheulian]] hand axe.

====Dispersal of modern ''Homo sapiens''====
Up until the genetic evidence became available, there were two dominant models for the dispersal of modern humans. The [[Multiregional evolution|multiregional hypothesis]] proposed that the genus ''Homo'' contained only a single interconnected population as it does today (not separate species), and that its evolution took place worldwide continuously over the last couple of million years. This model was proposed in 1988 by [[Milford H. Wolpoff]].&lt;ref name="multiregional"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolpoff |first1=Milford H. |author-link1=Milford H.

Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage, and strengthened the "out of Africa" theory and weakened the views of multiregional evolutionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webster|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdiy1EhJVW0C&amp;pg=PA53 53]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramachandran|Hua Tang|Gutenkunst|Bustamante|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlfPSpBvKLgC&amp;pg=PA606 606]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses have shown a greater diversity of DNA patterns throughout Africa, consistent with the idea that Africa is the ancestral home of [[mitochondrial Eve]] and [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], and that modern human dispersal out of Africa has only occurred over the last 55,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutty|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUqYgipyiGMC&amp;pg=PA40 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Out of Africa" has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial DNA and the male [[Y chromosome]]. After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed [[Mitochondrial Eve]]. "Out of Africa" is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among African populations.&lt;ref name="Cann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cann |first1=Rebecca L. |author-link1=Rebecca L.

In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the [[Horn of Africa]] crossing the Bab el Mandib to Yemen at a lower sea level around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="lahr" /&gt; This group seems to have been dependent upon marine resources for their survival.

[[Stephen Oppenheimer]] has proposed a second wave of humans may have later dispersed through the Persian Gulf oases, and the Zagros mountains into the Middle East. Alternatively it may have come across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] into Asia, from shortly after 50,000 yrs BP, resulting in the bulk of the human populations of Eurasia. It has been suggested that this second group possibly possessed a more sophisticated "big game hunting" tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of each [[glacial maximum]].&lt;ref name="lahr" /&gt; The multiple dispersal model is contradicted by studies indicating that the populations of Eurasia and the populations of Southeast Asia and Oceania are all descended from the same mitochondrial DNA L3 [[Lineage (genetic)|lineages]], which support a single migration out of Africa that gave rise to all non-African populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macaulay |first1=Vincent |last2=Hill |first2=Catherine |last3=Achilli |first3=Alessandro |last4=Rengo |first4=Chiara |last5=Clarke |first5=D |last6=Meehan |first6=W |last7=Blackburn |first7=J |last8=Semino |first8=O |last9=Scozzari |first9=R |last10=Cruciani |first10=F |last11=Taha |first11=A |last12=Shaari |first12=N.K. |last13=Raja |first13=J.M. |last14=Ismail |first14=P |last15=Zainuddin |first15=Z |last16=Goodwin |first16=W |last17=Bulbeck |first17=D |last18=Bandelt |first18=H.J. |last19=Oppenheimer |first19=S |last20=Torroni |first20=A |last21=Richards |first21=M |display-authors=3 |date=May 13, 2005 |title=Single, Rapid Coastal Settlement of Asia Revealed by Analysis of Complete Mitochondrial Genomes |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5724 |pages=1034–1036 |bibcode=2005Sci...308.1034M |doi=10.1126/science.1109792 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=15890885|s2cid=31243109 |url=http://psasir.upm.edu.my/id/eprint/40255/1/Single%2C%20rapid%20coastal%20settlement%20of%20Asia%20revealed%20by%20analysis%20of%20complete%20mitochondrial%20genomes.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the early date of Badoshan Iranian Aurignacian, Oppenheimer suggests that this second dispersal may have occurred with a pluvial period about 50,000 years before the present, with modern human big-game hunting cultures spreading up the Zagros Mountains, carrying modern human genomes from Oman, throughout the Persian Gulf, northward into Armenia and Anatolia, with a variant travelling south into Israel and to Cyrenicia.&lt;ref name = oppenheimer&gt;Oppenheimer, Stephen (2012), "Out of Eden: The Peopling of the World" (Robinson; New Ed edition (March 1, 2012))&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent genetic evidence suggests that all modern non-African populations, including those of Eurasia and Oceania, are descended from a single wave that left Africa between 65,000 and 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Posth"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pleistocene Mitochondrial Genomes Suggest a Single Major Dispersal of Non-Africans and a Late Glacial Population Turnover in Europe | journal = Current Biology | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–833 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2016.01.037 | pmid = 26853362 | vauthors = Posth C, Renaud G, Mittnik M, Drucker DG, Rougier H, Cupillard C, Valentin F, Thevenet C, Furtwängler A, Wißing C, Francken M, Malina M, Bolus M, Lari M, Gigli E, Capecchi G, Crevecoeur I, Beauval C, Flas D, Germonpré M, van der Plicht J, Cottiaux R, Gély B, Ronchitelli A, Wehrberger K, Grigorescu D, Svoboda J, Semal P, Caramelli D, Bocherens H, Harvati K, Conard NJ, Haak W, Powell A, Krause J | s2cid = 140098861 | display-authors = 6 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karmin M, Saag L, Vicente M, Wilson Sayres MA, Järve M, Talas UG, Rootsi S, Ilumäe AM, Mägi R, Mitt M, Pagani L, Puurand T, Faltyskova Z, Clemente F, Cardona A, Metspalu E, Sahakyan H, Yunusbayev B, Hudjashov G, DeGiorgio M, Loogväli EL, Eichstaedt C, Eelmets M, Chaubey G, Tambets K, Litvinov S, Mormina M, Xue Y, Ayub Q, Zoraqi G, Korneliussen TS, Akhatova F, Lachance J, Tishkoff S, Momynaliev K, Ricaut FX, Kusuma P, Razafindrazaka H, Pierron D, Cox MP, Sultana GN, Willerslev R, Muller C, Westaway M, Lambert D, Skaro V, Kovačevic L, Turdikulova S, Dalimova D, Khusainova R, Trofimova N, Akhmetova V, Khidiyatova I, Lichman DV, Isakova J, Pocheshkhova E, Sabitov Z, Barashkov NA, Nymadawa P, Mihailov E, Seng JW, Evseeva I, Migliano AB, Abdullah S, Andriadze G, Primorac D, Atramentova L, Utevska O, Yepiskoposyan L, Marjanovic D, Kushniarevich A, Behar DM, Gilissen C, Vissers L, Veltman JA, Balanovska E, Derenko M, Malyarchuk B, Metspalu A, Fedorova S, Eriksson A, Manica A, Mendez FL, Karafet TM, Veeramah KR, Bradman N, Hammer MF, Osipova LP, Balanovsky O, Khusnutdinova EK, Johnsen K, Remm M, Thomas MG, Tyler-Smith C, Underhill PA, Willerslev E, Nielsen R, Metspalu M, Villems R, Kivisild T | display-authors = 6 | title = A recent bottleneck of Y chromosome diversity coincides with a global change in culture | journal = Genome Research | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 459–66 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25770088 | pmc = 4381518 | doi = 10.1101/gr.186684.114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haber M, Jones AL, Connell BA, Arciero E, Yang H, Thomas MG, Xue Y, Tyler-Smith C | display-authors = 6 | title = A Rare Deep-Rooting D0 African Y-Chromosomal Haplogroup and Its Implications for the Expansion of Modern Humans Out of Africa | journal = Genetics | volume = 212 | issue = 4 | pages = 1421–1428 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31196864 | pmc = 6707464 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.119.302368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution are based comes from many fields of [[natural science]]. The main source of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record, but since the development of genetics beginning in the 1970s, DNA analysis has come to occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of ontogeny, [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] and especially [[evolutionary developmental biology]] of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life, including how humans evolved. The specific study of the origin and life of humans is [[anthropology]], particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the study of human [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanford|Allen|Antón|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and then the [[orangutan]]s (genus ''Pongo'') were the first groups to split from the line leading to the hominins, including humans—followed by gorillas (genus ''Gorilla''), and, ultimately, by the [[chimpanzee]]s (genus ''Pan''). The splitting date between hominin and chimpanzee lineages is placed by some between {{Mya|4|8}}, that is, during the [[Late Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Dawkins R 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|2004}}

Initial divergence occurred sometime between {{Mya|7|13}}, but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete separation during several millions of years. Patterson (2006) dated the final divergence at {{Mya|5|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = N | last2 = Richter | first2 = DJ | last3 = Gnerre | first3 = S | last4 = Lander | first4 = ES | last5 = Reich | first5 = D | year = 2006 | title = Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7097| pages = 1103–1108 | doi = 10.1038/nature04789 | pmid = 16710306 | bibcode = 2006Natur.441.1103P | s2cid = 2325560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic evidence has also been employed to resolve the question of whether there was any [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|gene flow between early modern humans and Neanderthals]], and to enhance the understanding of the early human migration patterns and splitting dates. By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor.

Each time a certain mutation ([[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants, a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial [[DNA]] which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose [[genetic marker]] is found in all modern humans, the so-called [[mitochondrial Eve]], must have lived around 200,000 years ago.

====Genetics====
{{Main|Human evolutionary genetics|Human genetic variation}}
Human evolutionary genetics studies how one [[human genome]] differs from the other, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects. Differences between genomes have [[Anthropology|anthropological]], medical and [[Forensic science|forensic]] implications and applications. Genetic data can provide important insight into human evolution.

===Evidence from the fossil record===
[[File:Homo habilis-KNM ER 1813.jpg|thumb|upright|Replica of fossil skull of ''[[Homo habilis]]''. Fossil number KNM ER 1813, found at [[Koobi Fora]], Kenya.]]
[[File:Homo ergaster.jpg|thumb|upright|Replica of fossil skull of ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (African ''Homo erectus''). Fossil number Khm-Heu 3733 discovered in 1975 in Kenya.]]
There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Begun |first=David R. |date=October 2010 |title=Miocene Hominids and the Origins of the African Apes and Humans |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=39 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.105047 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' dating from {{mya|7}}, ''Orrorin tugenensis'' dating from {{mya|5.7}}, and ''[[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus kadabba|Ardipithecus kadabba]]'' dating to {{mya|5.6}}. Each of these have been argued to be a [[bipedal]] ancestor of later hominins but, in each case, the claims have been contested. It is also possible that one or more of these species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes.

The question then of the relationship between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species, the australopithecines arose around {{mya|4}} and diverged into [[Paranthropus|robust]] (also called ''[[Paranthropus]]'') and [[Australopithecus|gracile]] branches, one of which (possibly ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]'') probably went on to become ancestors of the genus ''Homo''. The australopithecine species that is best represented in the fossil record is ''Australopithecus afarensis'' with more than 100 fossil individuals represented, found from Northern Ethiopia (such as the famous "Lucy"), to Kenya, and South Africa. Fossils of robust australopithecines such as ''Au. robustus'' (or alternatively ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'') and ''Au./P. boisei'' are particularly abundant in South Africa at sites such as [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]], and around [[Lake Turkana]] in Kenya.

The earliest member of the genus ''Homo'' is ''Homo habilis'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.8}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of the use of stone tools. They developed the [[Oldowan]] lithic technology, named after the Olduvai Gorge in which the first specimens were found. Some scientists consider ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'', a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original ''H. habilis'' fossils, to be a separate species, while others consider them to be part of ''H. habilis''—simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even [[sexual dimorphism]]. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living.

During the next million years, a process of encephalization began and, by the arrival (about {{Mya|1.9}}) of ''Homo erectus'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. ''Homo erectus'' were the first of the hominins to emigrate from Africa, and, from {{Mya|1.8|1.3}}, this species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe. One population of ''H. erectus'', also sometimes classified as a separate species ''Homo ergaster'', remained in Africa and evolved into ''Homo sapiens''. It is believed that these species, ''H. erectus'' and ''H. ergaster'', were the first to use fire and complex tools.

The earliest transitional fossils between ''H. ergaster/erectus'' and archaic ''H. sapiens'' are from Africa, such as ''Homo rhodesiensis''. These descendants of African ''H. erectus'' spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago, evolving into ''H. antecessor'', ''H. heidelbergensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis''. The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the Middle Paleolithic, about 300–200,000 years ago such as the Herto and [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia, [[Jebel Irhoud]] remains of Morocco, and Florisbad remains of South Africa; later fossils from [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids|Es Skhul]] cave in Israel and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years ago ({{Mya|0.09}}).

As modern humans spread out from Africa, they encountered other hominins such as ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and the [[Denisovans]], who may have evolved from populations of ''Homo erectus'' that had left Africa around {{mya|2}}. The nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species has been a long-standing source of controversy, the question being whether humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact similar enough to interbreed, in which case these earlier populations may have contributed genetic material to modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2009|pp=[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-9980-9_3#page-1 17–27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-01302012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Alanna |date=January 30, 2012 |title=DNA Turning Human Story Into a Tell-All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/science/gains-in-dna-are-speeding-research-into-human-origins.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This migration out of Africa is estimated to have begun about 70–50,000 years [[Before Present|BP]] and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization. They inhabited Eurasia and Oceania by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas by at least 14,500 years BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Bernard A. |date=December 1996 |title=Human evolution |journal=BioEssays |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=945–954 |doi=10.1002/bies.950181204 |issn=0265-9247 |pmid=8976151|s2cid=221464189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-species breeding===
{{Further|Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans}}
The hypothesis of interbreeding, also known as hybridization, admixture or hybrid-origin theory, has been discussed ever since the discovery of Neanderthal remains in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Huxley | first=T. | title=Collected Essays: Volume VII, Man's Place in Nature | year=1890 | chapter=The Aryan Question and Pre-Historic Man | chapter-url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE7/Aryan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear view of human evolution began to be abandoned in the 1970s as different species of humans were discovered that made the linear concept increasingly unlikely. In the 21st century with the advent of molecular biology techniques and computerization, [[whole-genome sequencing]] of Neanderthal and human [[genome]] were performed, confirming recent admixture between different human species.&lt;ref name=greenetal/&gt; In 2010, evidence based on molecular biology was published, revealing unambiguous examples of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. It has been demonstrated that interbreeding happened in several independent events that included Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as several unidentified hominins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2163910-our-ancestors-mated-with-the-mystery-denisovan-people-twice/ Our ancestors mated with the mystery ‘Denisovan’ people – twice].

[[File:Proconsul skeleton reconstitution (University of Zurich).JPG|thumb|Reconstructed tailless ''[[Proconsul (mammal)|Proconsul]]'' skeleton]]
In the [[Early Miocene]], about 22&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the many kinds of [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreally]] adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification. Fossils at 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago include fragments attributed to ''[[Victoriapithecus]]'', the earliest Old World monkey. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13&amp;nbsp;million years ago are ''[[Proconsul (mammal)|Proconsul]]'', ''[[Rangwapithecus]]'', ''[[Dendropithecus]]'', ''[[Limnopithecus]]'', ''[[Nacholapithecus]]'', ''[[Equatorius]]'', ''[[Nyanzapithecus pickfordi|Nyanzapithecus]]'', ''[[Afropithecus]]'', ''Heliopithecus'', and ''[[Kenyapithecus]]'', all from East Africa.

The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of [[Middle Miocene]] from sites far distant—''[[Otavipithecus]]'' from cave deposits in Namibia, and ''[[Pierolapithecus]]'' and ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' from France, Spain and Austria—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the Early and Middle Miocene. The youngest of the [[Miocene]] hominoids, ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', is from coal beds in Italy that have been dated to 9&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family Hylobatidae) diverged from the line of great apes some 18–12&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other great apes at about 12&amp;nbsp;million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown Southeast Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Sivapithecus]]'' from India and ''[[Griphopithecus]]'' from Turkey, dated to around 10&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Srivastava|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kCerOsM8XMwC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divergence of the human clade from other great apes===
Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans may be represented by ''[[Nakalipithecus]]'' fossils found in Kenya and ''[[Ouranopithecus]]'' found in Greece. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4&amp;nbsp;million years ago, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzees (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans. Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see [[human evolutionary genetics]]). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation – rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone – and [[sampling bias]] probably contribute to this problem.

Other hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt; and there they encountered antelope, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, horses, and others. The equatorial belt contracted after about 8&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and there is very little fossil evidence for the split—thought to have occurred around that time—of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees. The earliest fossils argued by some to belong to the human lineage are ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' (7 Ma) and ''Orrorin tugenensis'' (6 Ma), followed by ''Ardipithecus'' (5.5–4.4 Ma), with species ''Ar. kadabba'' and ''[[Ar. ramidus]]''.

It has been argued in a study of the life history of ''Ar. ramidus'' that the species provides evidence for a suite of anatomical and behavioral adaptations in very early hominins unlike any species of extant great ape.&lt;ref name="aramidus"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=G. |last2=Henneberg |first2=M. |title=The life history of Ardipithecus ramidus: a heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation |journal=[[Anthropological Review]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=109–132 |date=June 2015 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/anre.2015.78.issue-2/anre-2015-0009/anre-2015-0009.xml?format=INT |access-date=July 22, 2015 |doi=10.1515/anre-2015-0009|s2cid=54900467 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated affinities between the skull morphology of ''Ar. ramidus'' and that of infant and juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting the species evolved a juvenalised or [[paedomorphic]] craniofacial morphology via [[Heterochrony|heterochronic]] dissociation of growth trajectories. It was also argued that the species provides support for the notion that very early hominins, akin to bonobos (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') the less aggressive species of the genus ''Pan'', may have evolved via the process of [[self-domestication]]. Consequently, arguing against the so-called "chimpanzee referential model"&lt;ref name=sayers /&gt; the authors suggest it is no longer tenable to use [[chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes'') social and mating behaviors in models of early hominin social evolution. When commenting on the absence of aggressive canine morphology in ''Ar. ramidus'' and the implications this has for the evolution of hominin social psychology, they wrote:

{{quote|Of course ''Ar. ramidus'' differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex. However, the fact that ''Ar. ramidus'' shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in ''Ar. ramidus'' than what we see in bonobos.{{r|aramidus|page1=128}}}}

The authors argue that many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]] Africa. Consequently, they argue that humans may not represent evolution from a chimpanzee-like ancestor as has traditionally been supposed. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent [[Phylogeny|phylogenetically]] deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans.

===Genus ''Australopithecus''===
{{Main|Australopithecus}}
The genus ''Australopithecus'' evolved in eastern Africa around 4&amp;nbsp;million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2&amp;nbsp;million years ago. During this time period various forms of australopiths existed, including ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus sediba|Au. sediba]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]''. There is still some debate among academics whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as ''[[Australopithecus robustus|Au. robustus]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus boisei|Au. boisei]]'', constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be considered to be ''Au. robust australopiths'' whilst the others would be considered ''Au. gracile australopiths''. However, if these species do indeed constitute their own genus, then they may be given their own name, ''Paranthropus''.
* ''[[Australopithecus]]'' (4–1.8 Ma), with species ''[[Australopithecus anamensis|Au. anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]'', ''[[Australopithecus bahrelghazali|Au. bahrelghazali]]'', ''[[Australopithecus garhi|Au. garhi]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus sediba|Au. sediba]]'';
* ''[[Kenyanthropus]]'' (3–2.7 Ma), with species ''[[Kenyanthropus|K. platyops]]'';

A new proposed species ''[[Australopithecus deyiremeda]]'' is claimed to have been discovered living at the same time period of ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]''. There is debate if [[Australopithecus afarensis|Au.]] [[Australopithecus deyiremeda|deyiremeda]] is a new species or is ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Zimmer |date=May 27, 2015 |title=The Human Family Tree Bristles With New Branches |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/adding-branches-to-the-human-family-tree.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australopithecus prometheus'', otherwise known as [[Little Foot]] has recently been dated at 3.67&amp;nbsp;million years old through a new dating technique, making the genus ''Australopithecus'' as old as ''afarensis''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner., Elizabeth K.; Purdue University (April 1, 2015).

==Evolution of genus ''Homo''==
{{main|Homo}}
The earliest documented representative of the genus ''Homo'' is ''[[Homo habilis]]'', which evolved around {{Mya|2.8}},&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |author-link=Pallab Ghosh |date=March 4, 2015 |title='First human' discovered in Ethiopia |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31718336 |work=BBC News |location=London |access-date=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is arguably the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of the use of stone tools. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a [[chimpanzee]], although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the human [[SRGAP2]] [[gene]] doubled, producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal cortex. During the next million years a process of rapid [[encephalization]] occurred, and with the arrival of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' in the [[fossil#Dating|fossil record]], cranial capacity had doubled to 850&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such an increase in human brain size is equivalent to each generation having 125,000 more [[neuron]]s than their parents.) It is believed that ''Homo erectus'' and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' were the first to use fire and complex tools, and were the first of the hominin line to leave Africa, spreading throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe between {{Mya|1.3|1.8}}.

===''H. habilis'' and ''H. gautengensis''===
''Homo habilis'' lived from about 2.8&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; to 1.4 Ma. The species evolved in South and East Africa in the [[Piacenzian|Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]], 2.5–2 Ma, when it diverged from the australopithecines. ''Homo habilis'' had smaller molars and larger brains than the australopithecines, and made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones. One of the first known hominins was nicknamed 'handy man' by discoverer [[Louis Leakey]] due to its association with [[stone tool]]s. Some scientists have proposed moving this species out of ''Homo'' and into ''Australopithecus'' due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to [[Arboreal locomotion|living on trees]] rather than to [[Bipedalism|moving on two legs]] like ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Bernard |last2=Collard |first2=Mark |year=1999 |title=The changing face of Genus ''Homo'' |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=195–207 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)8:6&lt;195::AID-EVAN1&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 |issn=1060-1538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''H. ergaster'' and ''H. erectus''===
The first fossils of ''Homo erectus'' were discovered by Dutch physician [[Eugene Dubois]] in 1891 on the Indonesian island of Java. He originally named the material ''[[Anthropopithecus]] erectus'' (1892–1893, considered at this point as a chimpanzee-like fossil primate) and ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (1893–1894, changing his mind as of based on its morphology, which he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=William |author-link=William Turner Thiselton-Dyer |date=April 1895 |title=On M.

The early phase of ''Homo erectus'', from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is considered by some to be a separate species, ''Homo ergaster'', or as ''Homo erectus ergaster'', a subspecies of ''Homo erectus''.

In Africa in the Early Pleistocene, 1.5–1 Ma, some populations of ''Homo habilis'' are thought to have evolved larger brains and to have made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, ''Homo erectus''—in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoor |first1=Fred |last2=Wood |first2=Bernard A. |last3=Zonneveld |first3=Frans |date=June 23, 1994 |title=Implications of early hominid labyrinthine morphology for evolution of human bipedal locomotion |journal=Nature |volume=369 |issue=6482 |pages=645–648 |bibcode=1994Natur.369..645S |doi=10.1038/369645a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=8208290|s2cid=4344784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of locking knees and the movement of the foramen magnum are thought to be likely drivers of the larger population changes.

A famous example of ''Homo erectus'' is [[Peking Man]]; others were found in Asia (notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists now use the term ''Homo ergaster'' for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserve ''Homo erectus'' only for those fossils that are found in Asia and meet certain skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from ''H. ergaster''.

===''H. rhodesiensis'', and the Gawis cranium===
* ''H. rhodesiensis'', estimated to be 300,000–125,000 years old. Most current researchers place Rhodesian Man within the group of ''Homo heidelbergensis'', though other designations such as archaic ''Homo sapiens'' and ''Homo sapiens rhodesiensis'' have been proposed.
* In February 2006 a fossil, the [[Gawis cranium]], was found which might possibly be a species intermediate between ''H. erectus'' and ''H. sapiens'' or one of many evolutionary dead ends. The skull from Gawis, Ethiopia, is believed to be 500,000–250,000 years old. Only summary details are known, and the finders have not yet released a peer-reviewed study. Gawis man's facial features suggest its being either an intermediate species or an example of a "Bodo man" female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Semaw |first1=Sileshi |last2=Toth |first2=Nicholas |last3=Schick |first3=Kathy |last4=Simpson |first4=Scott |last5=Quade |first5=Jay |last6=Rogers |first6=Michael J. |date=March 27, 2006 |title=Scientists discover hominid cranium in Ethiopia |url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/3142.html |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |access-date=November 26, 2006 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of clear anatomical differences between [[anatomically modern humans]] (AMH) and Neanderthal populations. Many of these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments possessed by the Neanderthal populations. Their [[surface to volume ratio]] is an extreme version of that found amongst [[Inuit]] populations, indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains. This would seem to indicate that the intellectual superiority of AMH populations may be questionable. More recent research by Eiluned Pearce, [[Chris Stringer]], R.I.M. Dunbar, however, have shown important differences in brain architecture. For example, in both the orbital chamber size and in the size of the [[occipital lobe]], the larger size suggests that the Neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans. This would give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in Glacial Europe. It also seems that the higher body mass of Neanderthals had a correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control.&lt;ref name="dunbar"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Eiluned |last1=Pearce|first2= Chris|last2= Stringer|first3= R.I.M. |last3=Dunbar |year=2013|title=New insights into differences in brain organization between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans (Proceedings of the Royal Society) |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=280|issue=1758|pages=20130168|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0168|pmid=23486442|pmc=3619466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neanderthal populations seem to have been physically superior to AMH populations. These differences may have been sufficient to give Neanderthal populations an environmental superiority to AMH populations from 75,000 to 45,000 years BP. With these differences, Neanderthal brains show a smaller area was available for social functioning. Plotting group size possible from endocranial volume, suggests that AMH populations (minus occipital lobe size), had a [[Dunbars number]] of 144 possible relationships. Neanderthal populations seem to have been limited to about 120 individuals. This would show up in a larger number of possible mates for AMH humans, with increased risks of inbreeding amongst Neanderthal populations. It also suggests that humans had larger trade catchment areas than Neanderthals (confirmed in the distribution of stone tools). With larger populations, social and technological innovations were easier to fix in human populations, which may have all contributed to the fact that modern Homo sapiens replaced the Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP.&lt;ref name="dunbar"/&gt;

The flow of genes from Neanderthal populations to modern humans was not all one way. Sergi Castellano of the Max Planck Institute for [[Evolutionary Anthropology]] in Leipzig, Germany, has in 2016 reported that while Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes are more related to each other than they are to us, Siberian Neanderthal genomes show similarity to the modern human gene pool, more so than to European Neanderthal populations. The evidence suggests that the Neanderthal populations interbred with modern humans possibly 100,000 years ago, probably somewhere in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature16544 | volume=530 | issue=7591 | title=Ancient gene flow from early modern humans into Eastern Neanderthals | journal=Nature | pages=429–433 | pmid=26886800 | pmc=4933530 | last1 = Kuhlwilm | first1 = M | last2 = Gronau | first2 = I | last3 = Hubisz | first3 = MJ | last4 = de Filippo | first4 = C | last5 = Prado-Martinez | first5 = J | last6 = Kircher | first6 = M | last7 = Fu | first7 = Q | last8 = Burbano | first8 = HA | last9 = Lalueza-Fox | first9 = C | last10 = de la Rasilla | first10 = M | last11 = Rosas | first11 = A | last12 = Rudan | first12 = P | last13 = Brajkovic | first13 = D | last14 = Kucan | first14 = Ž | last15 = Gušic | first15 = I | last16 = Marques-Bonet | first16 = T | last17 = Andrés | first17 = AM | last18 = Viola | first18 = B | last19 = Pääbo | first19 = S | last20 = Meyer | first20 = M | last21 = Siepel | first21 = A | last22 = Castellano | first22 = S| bibcode = 2016Natur.530..429K | year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain [[Homo floresiensis#Additional features|additional anatomical features]] that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not) but much like those of ancient members of our genus.

Between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial period in the [[Middle Pleistocene]], around 250,000 years ago, the trend in [[Brain size#Cranial capacity|intra-cranial volume expansion]] and the elaboration of stone tool technologies developed, providing evidence for a transition from ''H. erectus'' to ''H. sapiens''. The direct evidence suggests there was a migration of ''H. erectus'' out of Africa, then a further [[speciation]] of ''H. sapiens'' from ''H. erectus'' in Africa. A subsequent migration (both within and out of Africa) eventually replaced the earlier dispersed ''H. erectus''. This migration and origin theory is usually referred to as the "recent single-origin hypothesis" or "out of Africa" theory.

The use of tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence, and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution, especially the continued expansion of the human brain.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Kwang Hyun|title=Origins of human intelligence: The chain of tool-making and brain evolution|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=5–22|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2016_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XXII_1_Ko.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption.

Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) [[Osteodontokeratic culture|may have used broken bones as tools]], but this is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-kOvkb-xbU8C&amp;pg=PA398 398]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Wood noted that ''Paranthropus'' co-existed with the early ''Homo'' species in the area of the "Oldowan Industrial Complex" over roughly the same span of time. Although there is no direct evidence which identifies ''Paranthropus'' as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area. Most paleoanthropologists agree that the early ''Homo'' species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils, ''Homo'' was always present, but ''Paranthropus'' was not.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

In 1994, Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the ''Homo'' and ''Paranthropus'' species were toolmakers. He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform. Susman posited that modern anatomy of the human opposable thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed toolmakers.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;

=={{anchor|Modern humans and the "Great Leap Forward" debate}}Transition to behavioral modernity==
{{Further|Behavioral modernity}}
Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (''H. habilis'', ''H. ergaster'', ''H. neanderthalensis'') started at a higher level than the previous one, but after each phase started, further development was slow. Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these ''Homo'' species possessed some or many of the cultural and behavioral traits associated with modern humans such as language, complex symbolic thinking, technological creativity etc. It seems that they were culturally conservative maintaining simple technologies and foraging patterns over very long periods.

Around 50,000 [[Before Present|BP]], modern human culture started to evolve more rapidly. The transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized by some as a "Great Leap Forward",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the "Upper Palaeolithic Revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bar-Yosef |first=Ofer |author-link=Ofer Bar-Yosef |date=October 2002 |title=The Upper Paleolithic Revolution |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=31 |pages=363–393 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085416 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the sudden appearance of distinctive signs of modern behavior and [[big game hunting]]&lt;ref name="oppenheimer" /&gt; in the archaeological record.

Modern humans started burying their dead, using animal hides to make clothing, hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using [[trapping pit]]s or driving animals off cliffs), and engaging in [[cave painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ambrose |first=Stanley H. |date=March 2, 2001 |title=Paleolithic Technology and Human Evolution |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5509 |pages=1748–1753 |bibcode=2001Sci...291.1748A |doi=10.1126/science.1059487 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11249821|s2cid=6170692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As human culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons, and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something that had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP. Typically, ''H. neanderthalensis'' populations do not vary in their technologies, although the [[Chatelperronian]] assemblages have been found to be Neanderthal innovations produced as a result of exposure to the Homo sapiens [[Aurignacian]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mellars | first1 = P | year = 2010 | title = Neanderthal symbolism and ornament manufacture: The bursting of a bubble? | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 107| issue = 47| pages = 20147–20148| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1014588107 | pmid=21078972 | pmc=2996706| bibcode =2010PNAS..10720147M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among concrete examples of [[modern human behavior]], anthropologists include specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (for example, burials with grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and [[barter]] trade networks. Debate continues as to whether a "revolution" led to modern humans ("the big bang of human consciousness"), or whether the evolution was more "gradual".&lt;ref name="Mcbrearty_Brooks" /&gt;

==Recent and ongoing human evolution==
{{main|Recent human evolution}}
[[Anatomically modern human]] populations continue to evolve, as they are affected by both natural selection and [[genetic drift]]. Although [[selection pressure]] on some traits, such as resistance to smallpox, has decreased in the modern age, humans are still undergoing natural selection for many other traits. Some of these are due to specific environmental pressures, while others are related to lifestyle changes since the development of agriculture (10,000 years ago), urbanization (5,000), and industrialization (250 years ago). It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cochran|Harpending|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent research indicates that for some traits, the developments and innovations of human culture have driven a new form of selection that coexists with, and in some cases has largely replaced, natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Andrea|date=August 8, 2019|title=The Role of Culture and Evolution for Human Cognition|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tops.12449|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|volume=12|issue=4|language=en|pages=1403–1420|doi=10.1111/tops.12449|pmid=31392845|issn=1756-8757|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly conspicuous is variation in superficial characteristics, such as [[Afro-textured hair]], or the recent evolution of [[light skin]] and blond hair in some populations, which are attributed to differences in climate. Particularly strong selective pressures have resulted in [[high-altitude adaptation in humans]], with different ones in different isolated populations. Studies of the [[High-altitude adaptation in humans#Genetic basis|genetic basis]] show that some developed very recently, with Tibetans evolving over 3,000 years to have high proportions of an allele of [[EPAS1]] that is adaptive to high altitudes.

Other evolution is related to [[endemic disease]]s: the presence of [[malaria]] selects for [[sickle cell trait]] (the [[heterozygote|heterozygous]] form of sickle cell gene), while in the absence of malaria, the health effects of [[sickle-cell anemia]] select against this trait. For another example, the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[PRNP|prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The frequency of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is due to the survival of immune persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Medical Research Council (UK) |author-link=Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) |date=November 21, 2009 |title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' evolves in Papua New Guinea community; could offer insights Into CJD |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm |work=ScienceDaily |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |access-date=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0809716| pmid = 19923577| year = 2009| last1 = Mead | first1 = S.| last2 = Whitfield | first2 = J.| last3 = Poulter | first3 = M.| last4 = Shah | first4 = P.| last5 = Uphill | first5 = J.| last6 = Campbell | first6 = T.| last7 = Al-Dujaily | first7 = H.| last8 = Hummerich | first8 = H.| last9 = Beck | first9 = J.| last10 = Mein | first10 = C.A.| last11 = Verzilli | first11 = C.| last12 = Whittaker | first12 = J.| last13 = Alpers | first13 = M.P.| last14 = Collinge | first14 = J.| title = A Novel Protective Prion Protein Variant that Colocalizes with Kuru Exposure| volume = 361| issue = 21| pages = 2056–2065| journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | url = https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4514/1/nejmoa0809716.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some reported trends remain unexplained and the subject of ongoing research in the novel field of evolutionary medicine:  [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS) reduces fertility and thus is expected to be subject to extremely strong negative selection, but its relative commonality in human populations suggests a counteracting selection pressure.  The identity of that pressure remains the subject of some debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Corbett|first1=Stephen|last2=Morin-Papunen|first2=Laure|date=July 2013|title=The Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and recent human evolution|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030372071300004X|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|language=en|volume=373|issue=1–2|pages=39–50|doi=10.1016/j.mce.2013.01.001|pmid=23352610|s2cid=13078403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent human evolution related to agriculture includes genetic resistance to infectious disease that has appeared in human populations by crossing the species barrier from domesticated animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as changes in metabolism due to changes in diet, such as [[lactase persistence]].

Culturally-driven evolution can defy the expectations of natural selection:  while human populations experience some pressure that drives a selection for producing children at younger ages, the advent of effective contraception, higher education, and changing social norms have driven the observed selection in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Courtiol|first1=Alexandre|last2=Tropf|first2=Felix C.|last3=Mills|first3=Melinda C.|date=July 12, 2016|title=When genes and environment disagree: Making sense of trends in recent human evolution|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1608532113|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=28|pages=7693–7695|doi=10.1073/pnas.1608532113|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4948334|pmid=27402758}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, culturally-driven selection need not necessarily work counter or in opposition to natural selection:  some proposals to explain the high rate of recent human brain expansion indicate a kind of feedback whereupon the brain's increased social learning efficiency encourages cultural developments that in turn encourage more efficiency, which drive more complex cultural developments that demand still-greater efficiency, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Markov|first1=Alexander V.|last2=Markov|first2=Mikhail A.|date=June 2020|title=Runaway brain‐culture coevolution as a reason for larger brains: Exploring the "cultural drive" hypothesis by computer modeling|url= |journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=10|issue=12|pages=6059–6077|doi=10.1002/ece3.6350|issn=2045-7758|pmc=7319167|pmid=32607213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally-driven evolution has an advantage in that in addition to the genetic effects, it can be observed also in the archaeological record:  the development of stone tools across the Palaeolithic period connects to culturally-driven cognitive development in the form of skill acquisition supported by the culture and the development of increasingly complex technologies and the cognitive ability to elaborate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stout|first=Dietrich|date=April 12, 2011|title=Stone toolmaking and the evolution of human culture and cognition|url= |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=366|issue=1567|pages=1050–1059|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0369|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3049103|pmid=21357227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
