==Etymology==
Slovenia's name means the "Land of the [[Slovenes]]" in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and other [[South Slavic languages]]. It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.

The reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slověninъ}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' ("word"), originally denoting "people who speak (the same language)," i.&amp;nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*němьcь}}, meaning "silent, mute people" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*němъ}} "[[muteness|mute]], mumbling"). The word ''slovo'' ("word") and the related ''slava'' ("glory, fame") and ''slukh'' ("hearing") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*ḱlew-}} ("be spoken of, glory"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κλέος}} ({{grc-tr|κλέος}} "fame"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} ("be called"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945–1955 |language=sl, en |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative–Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopač |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko društvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialistična republika Slovenija}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialistične republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=sl |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopač |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix "Socialist" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.

==== Roman era ====
[[File:Emona v Ljubljani (6).jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[Emona]]'s south wall (reconstruction) in present-day Ljubljana]]
The area that is present-day Slovenia was in Roman times shared between ''Venetia et Histria'' (region X of [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Roman Italia]] in the classification of [[Augustus]]) and the provinces [[Pannonia]] and [[Noricum]]. The Romans established posts at [[Emona]] (Ljubljana), [[Poetovio]] (Ptuj), and [[Celeia]] (Celje); and constructed trade and military roads that ran across Slovene territory from Italy to Pannonia. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the area was subject to invasions by the [[Huns]] and Germanic tribes during their incursions into Italy. A part of the inner state was protected with a defensive line of towers and walls called ''[[Claustra Alpium Iuliarum]]''. A [[Battle of the Frigidus|crucial battle]] between [[Theodosius I]] and [[Eugenius]] took place in the [[Vipava Valley]] in 394.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfram |first1=Herwig |title=The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples |date=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singleton |first1=Fred |title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slavic settlement ====
[[File:Klagenfurt Landhaus Großer Wappensaal Fürstenstein 19072006 6295.jpg|thumb|The [[Prince's Stone]], symbol of the [[Carantania|Duchy of Carantania]]]]
The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes migrated to the Alpine area after the westward departure of the [[Lombards]] (the last Germanic tribe) in 568, and under pressure from [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] established a [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic settlement in the Eastern Alps]]. From 623 to 624 or possibly 626 onwards, [[Samo|King Samo]] united the Alpine and Western Slavs against the Avars and Germanic peoples and established what is referred to as Samo's Kingdom. After its disintegration following Samo's death in 658 or 659, the ancestors of the [[Slovenes]] located in present-day [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] formed the independent [[Carantania|duchy of Carantania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0MqAQAAMAAJ |title=Na stičišču svetov: slovenska zgodovina od prazgodovinskih kultur do konca 18. stoletja |first=Peter |last=Štih |language=sl |trans-title=At the Junction of the Worlds: Slovene History from the Prehistoric Cultures to the End of the 18th Century |isbn=978-961-241-375-0 |publisher=Modrijan Publishing House |page=33|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carniola]], later duchy Carniola. Other parts of present-day Slovenia were again ruled by Avars before [[Charlemagne]]'s victory over them in 803.

=== Middle Ages ===
The [[Carantanians]], one of the ancestral groups of the modern Slovenes, particularly the [[Carinthian Slovenes]], were the first Slavic people to [[Christianization of the Slavs|accept Christianity]]. They were mostly Christianized by Irish missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the "Apostle of Carantanians". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].

[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] until 1414.]]

In the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.

After the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.

By the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spanheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.&lt;ref name="culture.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia – Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]]. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Patria del Friuli]] ruled present western Slovenia until [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] takeover in 1420.

[[File:Boj s Turki-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The Ottoman army battling the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Habsburgs]] in present-day Slovenia during the [[Great Turkish War]].]]
At the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Slovene Lands]] suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Turkish raids]]. In 1515, a [[Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515|peasant revolt]] spread across nearly the whole Slovene territory. In 1572 and 1573 the [[Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt]] wrought havoc throughout the wider region. Such uprisings, which often met with bloody defeats, continued throughout the 17th century.&lt;ref name="culture.si"/&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
After the dissolution of the Republic of Venice in 1797, the Venetian Slovenia was passed to the Austrian Empire. The [[Slovene Lands]] were part of the French-administered [[Illyrian provinces]] established by Napoleon, the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Slovenes inhabited most of [[Carniola]], the southern part of the duchies of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], the northern and eastern areas of the [[Austrian Littoral]], as well as [[Prekmurje]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (Austria-Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/ssj/article/download/3797/3208 |title=  The Terms Wende-Winde, Wendisch-Windisch in the Historiographic Tradition of the Slovene Lands|first=Rado |last=Lenček |author-link=Rado Lenček |year=1990 |journal= Slovene Studies Journal|volume=12 |issue=1 |page=94 |doi=10.7152/ssj.v12i1.3797|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialization was accompanied by construction of railroads to link cities and markets, but the urbanization was limited.

Due to limited opportunities, between 1880 and 1910 there was extensive emigration, and around 300,000 Slovenes (i.e. 1 in 6) emigrated to other countries,&lt;ref name="Benderly9"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXiCp49NJh8C&amp;pg=PA10 |title=Independent Slovenia: Origins, Movements, Prospects |chapter=In the Beginning: The Slovenes from the Seventh Century to 1945 |first1=Jill |last1=Benderly |first2=Evan |last2=Kraft |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-312-16447-8 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly to the [[United States|US]], but also to [[South America]] (the main part to [[Argentina]]), Germany, [[Egypt]], and to larger cities in Austria-Hungary, especially [[Vienna]] and [[Graz]]. The area of the United States with the highest concentration of Slovenian immigrants is [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The other locations in the United States where many Slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities: [[Pittsburgh]], [[Chicago]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], northern [[Minnesota]], and the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. The men were important as workers in the mining industry, because of some of the skills they brought from Slovenia. Despite this emigration, the population of Slovenia increased significantly.&lt;ref name="Benderly9"/&gt; Literacy was exceptionally high, at 80–90%.&lt;ref name="Benderly9"/&gt;

The 19th century also saw a revival of culture in [[Slovene language|Slovene]], accompanied by a [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] quest for cultural and political autonomy. The idea of a [[United Slovenia]], first advanced during the [[revolutions of 1848]], became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary. During the same period, [[Yugoslavism]], an ideology stressing the unity of all [[South Slavic peoples]], spread as a reaction to [[Pan-German nationalism]] and [[Italian irredentism]].

=== World War I ===
{{See also|Italian front (World War I)|Battles of the Isonzo|Treaty of London (1915)|Corfu Declaration}}
[[File:Eingebaute Mannschaftsunterstände am Monte Sabotino.jpg|thumb|The [[Battles of the Isonzo]] took place mostly in rugged mountainous areas above the Soča River.]]
[[World War I]] brought heavy casualties to Slovenes, particularly the twelve [[Battles of the Isonzo]], which took place in present-day Slovenia's western border area with Italy. Hundreds of thousands of Slovene conscripts were drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], and over 30,000 of them died. Hundreds of thousands of Slovenes from [[Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca]] were resettled in [[refugee camp]]s in Italy and Austria. While the refugees in Austria received decent treatment, the Slovene refugees in Italian camps were treated as state enemies, and several thousand died of malnutrition and diseases between 1915 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Petra Svoljšak, ''Slovenski begunci v Italiji med prvo svetovno vojno'' (Ljubljana 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Entire areas of the Slovene Littoral were destroyed.

The [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] of 1920 left approximately 327,000 out of the total population of 1.3&amp;nbsp;million Slovenes in Italy.&lt;ref name="SacroEgoismo2012"&gt;Lipušček, U.

This caused the mass emigration of Slovenes, especially the middle class, from the [[Slovene Littoral]] and [[Trieste]] to [[Yugoslavia]] and South America. Those who remained organized several connected networks of both passive and armed resistance. The best known was the [[Anti-fascism|militant anti-fascist]] organization [[TIGR]], formed in 1927 to fight Fascist oppression of the Slovene and Croat populations in the [[Julian March]].&lt;ref name="Mira Cencič 1997"&gt;Mira Cencič, ''TIGR'' (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatjana Rejec 1995"&gt;Tatjana Rejec, ''Pričevanja o TIGR-u'' (Ljubljana: [[Slovene Society]], 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovene People's Party]] launched a movement for self-determination, demanding the creation of a semi-independent [[South Slavic peoples|South Slavic]] state under [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the [[May Declaration (1917)|Declaration Movement]], followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kranjec |first=Silvo |chapter=Korošec Anton |title=Slovenski biografski leksikon |chapter-url=http://nl.ijs.si:8080/fedora/get/sbl:1188/VIEW/ |year=1925–1991 |edition=Online |publisher=[[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] |access-date=24 July 2010 |language=sl |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823082222/http://nl.ijs.si:8080/fedora/get/sbl:1188/VIEW/ |archive-date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demand was rejected by the Austrian political elites; but following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] took power in [[Zagreb]] on 6 October 1918. On 29 October, independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]].

[[File:Treaty of Rapallo.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The map showing the present territory of Slovenia, with traditional regional boundaries; the Slovene-speaking areas annexed by Italy after WWI are shown in stripes]]

On 1 December 1918, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs merged with [[Serbia]], becoming part of the new [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]; in 1929 it was renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized compared to other less developed parts of Yugoslavia, became the main center of industrial production: Compared to Serbia, for example, Slovenian industrial production was four times greater; and it was 22 times greater than in [[North Macedonia]]. The interwar period brought further industrialization in Slovenia, with rapid economic growth in the 1920s, followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the [[1929 economic crisis]] and [[Great Depression]].

Following a [[Carinthian Plebiscite|plebiscite]] in October 1920, the Slovene-speaking southern [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] was ceded to [[Austria]]. With the [[Treaty of Trianon]], on the other hand, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was awarded the Slovene-inhabited [[Prekmurje]] region, formerly part of [[Austro-Hungary]].

Slovenes living in territories that fell under the rule of the neighboring states—Italy, Austria, and Hungary—were subjected to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].

Axis forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 and defeated the country in a few weeks.

In south-central Slovenia, annexed by Fascist Italy and renamed the [[Province of Ljubljana]], the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation|Slovenian National Liberation Front]] was organized in April 1941.

After the resistance started in summer 1941, Italian violence against the Slovene civilian population escalated, as well. The Italian authorities deported some 25,000 people to the [[Italian concentration camps|concentration camps]], which equaled 7.5% of the population of their occupation zone. The most infamous ones were [[Rab concentration camp|Rab]] and [[Gonars concentration camp|Gonars]]. To counter the Communist-led insurgence, the Italians sponsored local anti-guerrilla units, formed mostly by the local conservative Catholic Slovene population that resented the revolutionary violence of the partisans. After the [[Italian armistice]] of September 1943, the Germans took over both the Province of Ljubljana and the Slovenian Littoral, incorporating them into what was known as the [[Operation Zone of Adriatic Coastal Region]]. They united the Slovene anti-Communist counter-insurgence into the [[Slovene Home Guard]] and appointed a puppet regime in the Province of Ljubljana. The anti-Nazi resistance however expanded, creating its own administrative structures as the basis for Slovene statehood within a new, federal and socialist Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=Tomasevich_2001&gt;{{cite book|first=Jozo|last=Tomasevich|title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941–1945: Occupation and Collaboration|volume=2|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8047-3615-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC|ref=Tomasevich_2001|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennison I.

In 1945, [[Yugoslavia]] was liberated by the partisan resistance and soon became a socialist federation known as the [[People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Slovenia joined the federation as a constituent republic, led by its own pro-Communist leadership.

Approximately 8% of the entire Slovene population died during [[World War II]]. The small [[Jews|Jewish]] community, mostly settled in the [[Prekmurje]] region, perished in 1944 in the [[Holocaust in Hungary|holocaust of Hungarian Jews]]. The German speaking minority, amounting to 2.5% of the Slovenian population prior to [[World War II|WWII]], was either expelled or killed in the aftermath of the war.

=== Socialist period ===
[[File:Razgledanje spomenika u Dražgošama.jpg|thumb|[[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Edvard Kardelj]] (left) in [[Dražgoše]], Slovenia, 1977.]]

Following the re-establishment of Yugoslavia during World War II, Slovenia became part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal Yugoslavia]]. A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito–Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by Italy after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.

After the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949 to 1953, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].

The late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965–66, Slovenia's [[Gross domestic product|domestic product]] was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.

Opposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.&lt;ref name="culture.si"/&gt; Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.

=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===
In 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.

In September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=sl |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8 |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072954/http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=sl |publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183414/http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which 'The Rally of Truth' in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|access-date=4 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archive-date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title="Rally of truth" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|access-date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--&gt; On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the "Republic of Slovenia".&lt;ref name="twenty.si"&gt;{{cite web |author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &amp;#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |access-date=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611063423/http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |archive-date=11 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave&lt;!-- sic! --&gt; Socialistične Republike Slovenije |language=sl |journal=Uradni List Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |access-date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jože Pučnik]] emerged victorious.

[[File:General map of slovenia.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|A topographic map of Slovenia]]

Slovenia is situated in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe]] touching the Alps and bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It lies between latitudes [[45th parallel north|45°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[13th meridian east|13°]] and [[17th meridian east|17° E]]. The [[15th meridian east]] almost corresponds to the middle line of the country in the direction west–east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geodetski-vestnik.com/49/4/gv49-4_637-638.pdf |title=O pomenu meridiana 15° vzhodno od Greenwicha |language=sl |first=Marjan |last=Jenko |year=2005 |journal=Geodetski Vestnik |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=637–638 |access-date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geometric Centre of the Republic of Slovenia|Geometric Center of the Republic of Slovenia]] is located at [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] 46°07'11.8" N and 14°48'55.2" E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drustvo-geoss.si/page/sl/geoss/simboli_in_sestavine |title=Simboli in sestavine |language=sl |publisher=GEOSS Society |access-date=12 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401225025/http://www.drustvo-geoss.si/page/sl/geoss/simboli_in_sestavine |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies in [[Slivna]] in the Municipality of [[Litija]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.stat.si/letopis/2011/01_11/01-01-11.htm |title=Geografske koordinate skrajnih točk |language=sl, en |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |access-date=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenia's highest peak is [[Triglav]] ({{cvt|2,864|m|ft|0|disp=or}}); the country's average height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] is {{cvt|557|m|ft|0}}.

Four major European geographic regions meet in Slovenia: the [[Alps]], the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], and the Mediterranean Sea. Although on the shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]] near the Mediterranean Sea, most of Slovenia is in the [[Black Sea]] [[drainage basin]]. The Alps—including the [[Julian Alps]], the [[Kamnik-Savinja Alps]] and the [[Karawanks|Karawank]] chain, as well as the [[Pohorje]] massif—dominate Northern Slovenia along its long border with [[Austria]]. Slovenia's Adriatic coastline stretches approximately {{convert|47|km|mi|0}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.stat.si/doc/pub/slo_figures_10.pdf |first=Tomaž |last=Valantič |title= Slovenija v številkah |journal=Slovenija V Številkah |year=2010 |language=sl, en |publisher= Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |access-date=2 February 2011 |issn= 1318-3745}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Italy to Croatia.
[[File:Mangart 16.jpg|thumb|Mount [[Mangart]], in the [[Julian Alps]], is the third-highest peak in Slovenia, after [[Triglav]] and [[Škrlatica]].]]
The term "[[Karst topography]]" refers to that of southwestern Slovenia's [[Karst Plateau]], a [[limestone]] region of underground rivers, gorges, and caves, between Ljubljana and the Mediterranean Sea. On the [[Pannonian plain]] to the East and Northeast, toward the Croatian and Hungarian borders, the landscape is essentially flat. However, most of Slovenia is hilly or mountainous, with around 90% of its land surface {{cvt|200|m|ft|0}} or more [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

More than half of Slovenia, which is {{convert|11823|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, is forested;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stat.si/StatWeb/News/Index/6963|title=In 2016, forest covered 58.3% of Slovenia|date=27 September 2017|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking it third in Europe, [[European countries by forest area|by percentage of area forested]], after [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. The areas are covered mostly by [[beech]], [[fir]]-beech and beech-[[oak]] forests and have a relatively high production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zgs.gov.si/eng/slovenian-forests/forests-in-slovenia/forestation-and-variety-of-forests/index.html |title=Forestation and variety of forests |publisher=Slovenia Forest Service |year=2009 |access-date=2 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410123608/http://www.zgs.gov.si/eng/slovenian-forests/forests-in-slovenia/forestation-and-variety-of-forests/index.html |archive-date=10 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of primeval forests are still to be found, the largest in the [[Kočevje]] area.

=== Geology ===
[[File:Žlebiči.jpg|thumbnail|Solution runnels (also known as rillenkarren) are a [[Karst topography|karst]] feature on the [[Karst Plateau]], as in many other karst areas of the world.]]
Slovenia is in a rather active [[seismic zone]] because of its position on the small [[Adriatic Plate]], which is squeezed between the [[Eurasian Plate]] to the north and the [[African Plate]] to the south and rotates counter-clockwise.&lt;ref name="Seisme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/en/Seismology/|title=Seismology|access-date=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the country is at the junction of three important [[Tectonics|geotectonic]] units: the Alps to the north, the Dinaric Alps to the south and the Pannonian Basin to the east.&lt;ref name="Seisme"/&gt; Scientists have been able to identify 60 destructive earthquakes in the past. Additionally, a network of seismic stations is active throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Seisme"/&gt; 

Many parts of Slovenia have a [[Carbonate rock|carbonate]] [[bedrock]] and extensive [[cave system]]s have developed.

=== Natural regions ===
The first regionalisations of Slovenia were made by geographers [[Anton Melik]] (1935–1936) and [[Svetozar Ilešič]] (1968). The newer regionalisation by [[Ivan Gams]] divided Slovenia in the following macroregions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/zbornik/perko_38.pdf |first=Drago |last=Perko |title=The Regionalization of Slovenia|journal=Geografski zbornik |year=1998 |volume=38 |pages=11–57 |id={{COBISS|ID=10668077}} |issn=0373-4498 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601160317/http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/zbornik/perko_38.pdf |archive-date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Strunjan bay (24209577441).jpg|Slovenian coast with cliffs|thumb]]

* the [[Alps]] (''Alpe'')
* the [[Slovene Prealps|subalpine landscapes]] (''predalpski svet'')
* the [[Slovene Littoral]] or [[Submediterranean]] Slovenia (''Primorje'' or ''submediteranska Slovenija'')
* the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] [[plateaus]] of the continental Slovenia (''dinarske planote celinske Slovenije'')
* [[Pannonian Plain|Subpannonian Slovenia]] (''subpanonska Slovenija'')

According to a newer natural geographic regionalisation, the country consists of four [[macroregion]]s. These are the Alpine, the Mediterranean, the Dinaric, and the [[Pannonia]]n landscapes. Macroregions are defined according to major relief units (the Alps, the Pannonian plain, the Dinaric mountains) and climate types (submediterranean, temperate continental, mountain climate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zrc-sazu.si/Zgds/glasgow/9.pdf |title=Modern climate change in Slovenia |access-date=1 April 2008 |last=Ogrin |first=Darko |date=August 2004 |work=Slovenia: a geographical overview |publisher=Association of the Geographical Societies of Slovenia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820073301/http://www.zrc-sazu.si/zgds/glasgow/9.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often quite interwoven.

Protected areas of Slovenia include national parks, regional parks, and nature parks, the largest of which is [[Triglav National Park]]. There are 286 [[Natura 2000]] designated protected areas, which include 36% of the country's land area, the largest percentage among European Union states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natura2000.gov.si/index.php?id=45&amp;L=1 |title=Natura 2000 in Slovenia |work=natura2000.gov.si |access-date=1 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514223806/http://www.natura2000.gov.si/index.php?id=45&amp;L=1 |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to [[Yale University]]'s [[Environmental Performance Index]], Slovenia is considered a "strong performer" in environmental protection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120505092852/http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 May 2012 |title=2012 EPI :: Rankings &amp;#124; Environmental Performance Index |publisher=Epi.yale.edu |access-date=25 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===

[[File:Climate types Slovenia 1970-2000.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Climate types of Slovenia 1970–2000 and [[climograph]]s for selected settlements.]]
Slovenia is located in temperate latitudes. The climate is also influenced by the variety of relief, and the influence of the [[Alps]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In the northeast, the [[continental climate]] type with greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails. In the coastal region, there is sub-[[Mediterranean climate]]. The effect of the sea on the temperature rates is also visible up the [[Soča]] Valley, while a severe [[Alpine climate]] is present in the high mountain regions. There is a strong interaction between these three climatic systems across most of the country.&lt;ref name="arso.gov.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/en/Weather/climate/Climate_of_Slovenia_at_glance.pdf |title=Climate of Slovenia at Glance |author=Tanja Cegnar |publisher=Arso.gov.si |access-date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arso.gov.si Meteo Archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meteo.si/met/en/app/webmet/#webmet==8Sdwx2bhR2cv0WZ0V2bvEGcw9ydlJWblR3LwVnaz9SYtVmYh9iclFGbt9SaulGdugXbsx3cs9mdl5WahxXYyNGapZXZ8tHZv1WYp5mOnMHbvZXZulWYnwCchJXYtVGdlJnOn0UQQdSf; |title=National Meteorological Service of Slovenia – Archive |publisher=Meteo.si |access-date=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618145647/http://www.meteo.si/met/en/app/webmet/#webmet==8Sdwx2bhR2cv0WZ0V2bvEGcw9ydlJWblR3LwVnaz9SYtVmYh9iclFGbt9SaulGdugXbsx3cs9mdl5WahxXYyNGapZXZ8tHZv1WYp5mOnMHbvZXZulWYnwCchJXYtVGdlJnOn0UQQdSf; |archive-date=18 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]], often coming from [[Gulf of Genoa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kotišče ciklonov v zavetrju Alp|url=http://www.gore-ljudje.net/novosti/40204/|access-date=19 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904020314/http://www.gore-ljudje.net/novosti/40204/|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; varies across the country as well, with over {{convert|3500|mm|0|abbr=on}} in some western regions and dropping down to {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} in [[Prekmurje]]. Snow is quite frequent in winter and the record snow cover in Ljubljana was recorded in 1952 at {{convert|146|cm|0|abbr=on}}.

Compared to Western Europe, Slovenia is not very windy, because it lies in the slipstream of the Alps. The average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries. Due to the rugged terrain, local vertical winds with daily periods are present. Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the [[bora (wind)|bora]], the [[jugo]], and the [[foehn wind|foehn]]. The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia. Generally present in Slovenia are the northeast wind, the southeast wind and the [[north wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/cd/klima1/Zaslon/PDF%20Zaslon/19-Znacilnosti%20vetra%20v%20Sloveniji.pdf |chapter=Značilnosti vetra v Sloveniji |language=sl |trans-chapter=Characteristics of Wind in Slovenia |title=Klimatografija Slovenije |first=Renato |last=Bertalanič |year=2003 |publisher=Meteorology Office, Slovenian Environment Agency |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209055155/http://www.arso.gov.si/cd/klima1/Zaslon/PDF%20Zaslon/19-Znacilnosti%20vetra%20v%20Sloveniji.pdf |archive-date=9 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waters ===
[[File:Lake Bohinj (9452094709).jpg|thumb|[[Lake Bohinj]], largest Slovenian lake, one of the two springs of the [[Sava]] River]]
The territory of Slovenia mainly ({{convert|16423|km2|sp=us|disp=or}}, i.e. 81%) belongs to the [[Black Sea]] basin, and a smaller part ({{convert|3850|km2|sp=us|disp=or}}, i.e. 19%) belongs to the [[Adriatic Sea]] basin. These two parts are divided into smaller units in regard to their central rivers, the [[Mur (river)|Mura]] River basin, the [[Drava]] River basin, the [[Sava]] River basin with [[Kupa|Kolpa]] River basin, and the basin of the Adriatic rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.arso.gov.si/vode/publikacije%20in%20poro%c4%8dila/Vodno_bogastvo_2tekoce_vode.pdf |title=Vodno bogastvo Slovenije: tekoče vode |publisher=Slovenian Environment Agency |access-date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with other [[developed countries]], water quality in Slovenia is considered to be among the highest in Europe. One of the reasons is undoubtedly that most of the rivers rise on the mountainous territory of Slovenia. But this does not mean that Slovenia has no problems with surface water and groundwater quality, especially in areas with [[intensive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrožič|first1=Špela|title=Water Quality in Slovenia|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/en/water/reports%20and%20publications/Kakovost%20voda-ANG.pdf|publisher=ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA|access-date=19 August 2015|date=March 2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiversity ===
[[File:P anguinus2.jpg|thumb|[[Olm]] can be found in the [[Postojna cave]] and other caves in the country.]]
Slovenia signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 13 June 1992 and became a party to the convention on 9 July 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |access-date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 30 May 2002.

Slovenia is distinguished by an exceptionally wide variety of habitats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.sycp.si/Portals/0/Files/filebroker.aspx@id=6237.pdf |chapter=Characteristics of Biological and Landscape Diversity in Slovenia |title=Biological and Landscape Diversity in Slovenia: An Overview |publisher=Environmental Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning |year=2001 |editor=Hlad, Branka |editor2=Skoberne, Peter |page=IX |isbn=961-6324-17-9 |place=Ljubljana |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125091811/http://www.sycp.si/Portals/0/Files/filebroker.aspx%40id%3D6237.pdf |archive-date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the contact of geological units and biogeographical regions, and due to human influences.

Slovenia is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] republic with a [[multi-party system]]. The [[head of state]] is the [[President of Slovenia|president]], who is elected by popular vote and has an important integrative role.&lt;ref name="Furtlehner"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQafEg3TQJUC&amp;pg=PA126 |title=Compliance in the Enlarged European Union: Living Rights Or Dead Letters? |editor1-first=Gerda |editor1-last=Falkner |editor2-first=Oliver |editor2-last=Treib |editor3-first=Elizabeth |editor3-last=Holzleithner |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7546-7509-9 |pages=126–127 |chapter=Slovenia |first=Petra |last=Furtlehner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president is elected for five years and at maximum for two consecutive terms.

The executive and [[administration (business)|administrative]] authority in Slovenia is held by the [[Government of Slovenia]] (''{{lang|sl|Vlada Republike Slovenije}}''),&lt;ref name="Borak2004"/&gt; headed by the [[Prime Minister of Slovenia|Prime Minister]] and the council of ministers or cabinet, who are elected by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]] ({{lang|sl|Državni zbor Republike Slovenije}}).

Of those, 88 are elected by all the citizens in a system of [[proportional representation]], whereas two are elected by the registered members of the [[indigenism|autochthonous]] Hungarian and Italian [[Ethnic Minorities|minorities]]. Election takes place every four years. The [[National Council (Slovenia)|National Council]] (''{{lang|sl|Državni svet Republike Slovenije}}''), consisting of forty members, appointed to represent social, economic, professional and local interest groups, has a limited advisory and control power.&lt;ref name="Prunk2007"/&gt;
The 1992–2004 period was marked by the rule of the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]], which was responsible for gradual transition from the [[Titoism|Titoist]] economy to the capitalist market economy. It later attracted much criticism by neo-liberal economists, who demanded a less gradual approach. The party's president [[Janez Drnovšek]], who served as prime minister between 1992 and 2002, was one of the most influential Slovenian politicians of the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/zivljenje-janeza-drnovska/79437 |title=Življenje Janeza Drnovška :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside President [[Milan Kučan]] (who served between 1990 and 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OegWny-r8TEC&amp;pg=PA30 |title=Democratic Transition in Slovenia: Value Transformation, Education, And Media |first1=Sabrina |last1=P.

The 2005–2008 period was characterized by over-enthusiasm after joining the EU. During the first term of [[Janez Janša]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].

After the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Janša's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005–2008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Janša]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Janša attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that both left and right parties contributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; the reason behind this was that each bloc tried to establish an economic elite which would support its political forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pavlovčič|first1=Idija|title=Jože P.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Slovenia}}

Judicial powers in Slovenia are executed by judges, who are elected by the National Assembly. Judicial power in Slovenia is implemented by courts with general responsibilities and specialised courts that deal with matters relating to specific legal areas. The [[State's Attorney|State Prosecutor]] is an independent state authority responsible for prosecuting cases brought against those suspected of committing criminal offences. The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.&lt;ref name="culture.si"/&gt;

In 2016, military spending was an estimated 0.91% of the country's GDP. Since joining [[NATO]], the Slovenian Armed Forces have taken a more active part in supporting international peace. They have participated in peace support operations and humanitarian activities. Among others, Slovenian soldiers are a part of international forces serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskavojska.si/en/international-cooperation/ |title=International Cooperation |publisher=Slovenian Armed Forces |access-date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Municipalities ====
Officially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 municipalities (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''župan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''občinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.&lt;ref name="www2.gov.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''načelnik občinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.&lt;ref name="www2.gov.si"/&gt;

==== Administrative districts ====
There is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia. The 62 administrative districts, officially called "Administrative Units" (''upravne enote''), are only subdivisions of the national government administration and are named after their respective bases of government offices. They are headed by a Manager of the Unit (''načelnik upravne enote''), appointed by the Minister of Public Administration.

==== Traditional regions and identities ====
Traditional regions were based on the former [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[crown land]]s that included [[Carniola]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], and the [[Slovene Littoral|Littoral]]. Stronger than with either the Carniola as a whole, or with Slovenia as the state, Slovenes historically tend to identify themselves with the traditional regions of [[Slovene Littoral]], [[Prekmurje]], and even traditional (sub)regions, such as Upper, Lower and, to a lesser extent, Inner Carniola.&lt;ref name="Repe_deželani_ali_državljani"&gt;Repe, Božo (2003) [http://sistory.si/?urn=SISTORY:ID:5288 Od deželana do državljana: Regionalni razvoj Slovencev v letih 1918–1991] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223100928/http://sistory.si/?urn=SISTORY:ID:5288 |date=23 February 2013 }}, Zgodovinski časopis, 3–4, Ljubljana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital city Ljubljana was historically the administrative center of Carniola and belonged to [[Inner Carniola]],&lt;ref name="Mehle"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mehle Mihovec |first1=Barbka |title=Kje so naše meje? |url=http://arhiv.gorenjskiglas.si/article/20080319/C/303199950/kje-so-nase-meje |access-date=19 December 2018 |work=Gorenjski glas |date=19 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219140756/http://arhiv.gorenjskiglas.si/article/20080319/C/303199950/kje-so-nase-meje |archive-date=19 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; except for the Šentvid district, which was in [[Upper Carniola]] and also where the border between German-annexed territory and the Italian [[Province of Ljubljana]] was during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Mehle"/&gt;

==== Statistical regions ====
The 12 ''statistical regions'' have no administrative function and are subdivided into two macroregions for the purpose of the [[Regional policy of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-RA-07-020/EN/KS-RA-07-020-EN.PDF |title=Regions in the European Union: Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics |publisher=European Commission |access-date=25 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221195504/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-RA-07-020/EN/KS-RA-07-020-EN.PDF |archive-date=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These two macroregions are:
*[[Eastern Slovenia]] (''Vzhodna Slovenija'' – SI01), which groups the Mura, Drava, Carinthia, Savinja, Central Sava, Lower Sava, Southeast Slovenia, and Inner Carniola–Karst statistical regions.
*[[Western Slovenia]] (''Zahodna Slovenija'' – SI02), which groups the Central Slovenia, Upper Carniola, Gorizia, and Coastal–Karst statistical regions.

=== Economic growth ===

In 2004–06, the economy grew on average by nearly 5% a year in Slovenia; in 2007, it expanded by almost 7%. The growth surge was fuelled by debt, particularly among firms, and especially in construction. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] had a significant impact on the domestic economy.&lt;ref name="Slovenia's Economy: Next in Line"&gt;{{cite news|title=Slovenia's Economy: Next in Line|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560567|access-date=22 August 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction industry was severely hit in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="ST2012-03-13"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/double-dip-recession-is-the-%E2%80%98official%E2%80%99-reality |title=Double Dip Recession is the 'Slovenian' Reality |newspaper=The Slovenia Times |date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Slovenian [[GDP per capita]] shrank by 8%, the biggest decline in the European Union after the [[Baltic countries]] and Finland. An increasing burden for the Slovenian economy has been its rapidly aging population.&lt;ref name="CNBC2012-01-23"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/46010334/Countries_With_Aging_Populations?slide=3 |title=Countries with Aging Populations |work=CNBC |date=23 January 2012 |first=Rajeshni |last=Naidu-Ghelani |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223035533/http://www.cnbc.com/id/46010334/Countries_With_Aging_Populations?slide=3 |archive-date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the year-on-year contraction was 0.8%; however, 0.2% growth was recorded in the first quarter (in relation to the quarter before, after data was adjusted according to season and working days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/statistics-office-to-release-gdp-data-for-q2 |title=Statistics Office to Release GDP Data for Q2 |newspaper=The Slovenia Times |date=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year-on-year contraction has been attributed to the fall in domestic consumption and the slowdown in export growth. The decrease in domestic consumption has been attributed to the fiscal [[austerity]], to the freeze on budget expenditure in the final months of 2011,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/slovenia-s-economy-falls-in-recession-as-export-growth-weakens.html |title=Slovenia's Economy Falls into a Recession as Exports Weaken |first=Boris |last=Cerni |date=29 February 2012 |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the failure of the efforts to implement [[microeconomic reform|economic reforms]], to inappropriate financing, and to the decrease in exports.&lt;ref name="RTV2012-02-29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/gospodarstvo/zdrs-v-recesijo-so-ekonomisti-pricakovali/277878 |title=Zdrs v recesijo so ekonomisti pričakovali |language=sl |newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=RTV Slovenija |issn=1581-372X |date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the effects of the crisis, it was expected that several banks had to be bailed out by EU funds in 2013; however, needed capital was able to be covered by the country's own funds. Fiscal actions and legislations aiming on the reduction of spendings as well as several privatisations supported an economic recovery as from 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/slovenia-turns-itself-around-greece-bailout-bank-crisis/ |title=How Slovenia turned itself around |last=MacDowall |first=Andrew |date=15 July 2015 |website=Politico Europe |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real economic growth rate was at 2.5% in 2016 and accelerated to 5% in 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stat.si/StatWeb/en/News/Index/7266 |title=GDP up by 6.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and by 5.0% in 2017 – Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia|access-date=5 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction sector has seen a recent increase,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and the tourism industry is expected to have continuous rising numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://seenews.com/news/tourism-contributes-35-directly-to-slovenias-gdp-in-2016-wttc-572255 |title=Tourism contributes 3.5% directly to Slovenia's GDP in 2016 – WTTC |last=Garaca |first=Maja |date=14 June 2017 |website=seenews.com |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803130635/https://seenews.com/news/tourism-contributes-35-directly-to-slovenias-gdp-in-2016-wttc-572255 |archive-date=3 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
{{Further|Energy in Slovenia}}
In 2018, the net energy production was 12,262&amp;nbsp;GWh and consumption was 14,501&amp;nbsp;GWh.

A large [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage hydro power plant]] Kozjak on the [[Drava]] River is in the planning stage.

At the end of 2018, at least 295&amp;nbsp;MWp of [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic modules]] and 31,4&amp;nbsp;MW of [[Biogas power plant|biogas powerplants]] were installed. Compared to 2017, renewable energy sources contributed 5,6 percentage points more into whole energy consumption. There is interest to add more production in the area of solar and wind energy sources (subsidising schemes are increasing economic feasibility), but microlocation settlement procedures take enormous toll on the efficiency of this intitiatve (nature preservation vs. energy production facilities dilemma).&lt;ref name="agencija"/&gt;

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Slovenia}}
Since Antiquity, geography has dictated transport routes in Slovenia. Significant mountain ranges, major rivers and proximity to the Danube played roles in the development of the area's transportation corridors. One recent particular advantage are the [[Pan-European transport corridor]]s [[Pan-European transport corridor V|V]] (the fastest link between the North Adriatic, and Central and Eastern Europe) and [[Pan-European Corridor X|X]] (linking Central Europe with the Balkans). This gives it a special position in the European social, economic and cultural integration and restructuring.&lt;ref name="UKOM2000-11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/transport/slovenia_a_country_at_the_crossroads_of_transport_links/ |title=Slovenia, a Country at the Crossroads of Transport Links |publisher=Government Communication Office, Republic of Slovenia |date=November 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708045103/http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/transport/slovenia_a_country_at_the_crossroads_of_transport_links/ |archive-date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Slovenia|Slovene language}}
The official language in Slovenia is [[Slovene language|Slovene]], which is a member of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic language group]]. In 2002, Slovene was the native language of around 88% of Slovenia's population according to the census, with more than 92% of the Slovenian population speaking it in their home environment.&lt;ref name="siol.net"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.siol.net/kultura/novice/2009/02/slovenscina_materni_jezik_za_88_odstotkov_drzavljanov.aspx |title= Slovenščina materni jezik za 88 odstotkov državljanov |publisher= [[Siol]] |date= 19 February 2009 |access-date= 2 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120516055023/http://www.siol.net/kultura/novice/2009/02/slovenscina_materni_jezik_za_88_odstotkov_drzavljanov.aspx |archive-date= 16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stat.si"&gt;{{cite book|url =http://www.stat.si/popis2002/gradivo/2-169.pdf |title= Verska, jezikovna in narodna sestava prebivalstva Slovenije: Popisi 1921–2002 |language=sl |publisher= Statistični urad Republike Slovenije |year= 2003 |issue= 2 |first= Milivoja |last =Šircelj |isbn= 961-239-024-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic ranks Slovenia among the most homogeneous countries in the EU in terms of the share of speakers of the predominant mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Dular"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1482640 |title= Linguist Says Slovenian Language Not Endangered |date= 21 February 2010 |publisher= Slovenian Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Slovenian Passport3.jpg|thumb|upright|Front cover of a bilingual passport in Slovene and [[Italian language|Italian]]]]

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Italian language in Slovenia|Italian]], spoken by the respective minorities, enjoy the status of official languages in the ethnically mixed regions along the Hungarian and Italian borders, to the extent that even the passports issued in those areas are bilingual. In 2002 around 0.2% of the Slovenian population spoke Italian and around 0.4% spoke Hungarian as their native language. Hungarian is co-official with Slovene in 30 settlements in 5 municipalities (whereof 3 are officially bilingual). Italian is co-official with Slovene in 25 settlements in 4 municipalities (all of them officially bilingual).

German, which used to be the largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (around 4% of the population in 1921), is now the native language of only around 0.08% of the population, the majority of whom are more than 60 years old.&lt;ref name="stat.si"/&gt; [[Gottscheerish]] or ''Granish'', the traditional German dialect of [[Gottschee]] County, faces extinction.&lt;ref name="norwaysi"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.norway.si/ARKIV/heritage/granish/ |title= Granish – a Minority Language Spoken in Slovenia |publisher= Norway.si |access-date= 2 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of people in Slovenia speak a variant of [[Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], or [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]) as their native language. These are mostly immigrants who moved to Slovenia from other [[former Yugoslav]] republics from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and their descendants. In 2002, 0.4% of the Slovenian population declared themselves to be native speakers of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and 0.2% native speakers of [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].&lt;ref name="stat.si"/&gt; [[Czech language|Czech]], the fourth-largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (after German, Hungarian, and Serbo-Croatian), is now the native language of a few hundred residents of Slovenia.&lt;ref name="stat.si"/&gt;

Regarding the knowledge of foreign languages, Slovenia ranks among the top European countries. The most taught foreign languages are English, German, Italian, French and Spanish. {{As of|2007}}, 92% of the population between the age of 25 and 64 spoke at least one foreign language and around 71.8% of them spoke at least two foreign languages, which was the highest percentage in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-24092009-AP/EN/3-24092009-AP-EN.PDF European Day of Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124065821/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-24092009-AP/EN/3-24092009-AP-EN.PDF |date=24 January 2013 }}, Eurostat Newsrelease, 24 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Eurobarometer]] survey, {{as of|2005|lc=on}} the majority of Slovenes could speak [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (61%) and English (56%).&lt;ref name="EurobarLang"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |title= Special Eurobarometer 386 Europeans and Their Languages |date= June 2012 |access-date= 18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}

A reported 42% of Slovenes could speak German, which was one of the highest percentages outside German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="EurobarLang"/&gt; Italian is widely spoken on the [[Slovenian Istria|Slovenian Coast]] and in some other areas of the [[Slovene Littoral]].

In 2015, about 12% (237,616 people) of the population in Slovenia was born abroad.&lt;ref name="SURS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pxweb.stat.si/pxweb/dialog/statfile1.asp |title=SI-Stat Data Portal |publisher=SURS |access-date=19 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613133216/http://pxweb.stat.si/pxweb/Dialog/statfile1.asp |archive-date=13 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 86% of the foreign-born population originated from other countries of former Yugoslavia as (in descending order) [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], followed by immigrants from [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]], and [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="SURS" /&gt;

By the beginning of 2017, there were about 114,438 people with foreign citizenship residing in the country making up 5.5% of the total population. Of these foreigners, 76% had citizenships of the other countries from former Yugoslavia (excluding Croatia). Additionally 16.4% had EU-citizenships and 7.6% had citizenships of other countries.&lt;ref name="SURS" /&gt;

According to the 2002 census, Slovenia's main ethnic group are [[Slovenes]] (83%), however their share in the total population is continuously decreasing due to their relatively low [[fertility rate]].

After Slovenia joined the EU in 2004, the annual number of immigrants doubled by 2006 and increased by half yet again by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20110427193532/http://www.stat.si/pxweb/Database/Dem_soc/05_prebivalstvo/20_selitve/01_05563_meddrzavne_selitve/01_05563_meddrzavne_selitve.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Slovenia had one of the fastest growing [[net migration rate]]s in the European Union.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== Emigration ===
As to emigration, between 1880 and 1918 (World War I) many men left Slovenia to work in mining areas in other nations. The United States in particular has been a common choice for emigration, with the 1910 US Census showing that there were already "183,431 persons in the USA of Slovenian mother tongue".{{dubious|date=April 2016}} But there may have been many more, because a good number avoided anti-Slavic prejudice and "identified themselves as Austrians." Favorite localities before 1900 were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, as well as [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[Joliet, Illinois]], [[Cleveland]], Ohio, and rural areas of Iowa. After 1910, they settled in Utah (Bingham Copper Mine), Colorado (especially Pueblo), and Butte, Montana. These areas attracted first many single men (who often boarded with Slovenian families). After locating work and having sufficient money, the men sent back for their wives and families to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Slovenian-Americans.html|title=Slovenian Americans – History, Modern era, The first slovenians in america, Settlement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

Before World War II, 97% of the population declared itself [[Roman Catholicism in Slovenia|Catholic]] ([[Roman Rite]]), around 2.5% as Lutheran, and around 0.5% of residents identified themselves as members of other denominations.&lt;ref name="stat.si"/&gt; After 1945, the country underwent a process of gradual but steady [[secularization]]. After a decade of persecution of religions, the Communist regime adopted a policy of relative tolerance towards churches. After 1990, the Catholic Church regained some of its former influence, but Slovenia remains a largely secularized society. According to the 2002 census, 57.8% of the population is Catholic. In 1991, 71.6% were self-declared Catholics which means a drop of more than 1% annually.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, Census of Population, Households and Housing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Slovenian Catholics belong to the [[Latin Rite]]. A small number of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]] live in the [[White Carniola]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lokalno.si/si/aktualno/ljudje/?id=26004|title=Uskoška dediščina Bele krajine na RTVS&amp;#124;Ljudje&amp;#124;Lokalno aktualno|publisher=Lokalno.si|date=6 January 2012|access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a relatively small number of [[Protestants]] (less than 1% in 2002), the Protestant legacy is historically significant given that the Slovene standard language and Slovene literature were established by the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century. [[Primoz Trubar]], a theologian in the [[Lutheran]] tradition, was one of the most influential [[Protestant Reformers]] in Slovenia. Protestantism was extinguished in the [[Counter-Reformation]] implemented by the [[Habsburg dynasty]], which controlled the region. It only survived in the easternmost regions due to protection of Hungarian nobles, who often happened to be [[Calvinist]] themselves. Today, a significant [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minority lives in the easternmost region of [[Prekmurje]], where they represent around a fifth of the population and are headed by a bishop with the seat in [[Murska Sobota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evang-cerkev.si/sl/page.asp?id_informacija=35&amp;id_language=1&amp;id_meta_type=10|title=Predstavitev|publisher=Evang-cerkev.si|access-date=2 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610182949/http://www.evang-cerkev.si/sl/page.asp?id_informacija=35&amp;id_language=1&amp;id_meta_type=10|archive-date=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third largest denomination, with around 2.2% of the population, is the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], with most adherents belonging to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] while a minority belongs to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonian]] and other Eastern Orthodox churches.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

According to the 2002 census, [[Islam]] is the second largest religious denomination in the country, with around 2.4% of the population. Most Slovenian Muslims came from [[Bosnia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamska-skupnost.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2|title=Islamska Skupnost v Republiki Sloveniji|publisher=Islamska-skupnost.si|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319195651/http://www.islamska-skupnost.si/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2|archive-date=19 March 2012|access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovenia has long been home to a [[History of the Jews in Slovenia|Jewish community]]. Despite the losses suffered during the [[Holocaust]], Judaism still numbers a few hundred adherents, mostly living in Ljubljana, site of the sole remaining active synagogue in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/slovenia.html|title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour – Slovenia|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|date=4 March 2003|access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002, around 10% of Slovenes declared themselves as [[atheists]], another 10% professed no specific denomination, and around 16% decided not to answer the question about their religious affiliation. According to the [[Eurobarometer]] Poll 2010,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |title= Special Eurobarometer, biotechnology, page 204 |year=2010 |orig-year= Fieldwork: Jan–Feb 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 32% of Slovenian citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", whereas 36% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 26% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Slovenia}}

Slovenia's education ranks as the 12th best in the world and 4th best in the [[European Union]], being significantly higher than the [[OECD]] average, according to the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=Table: Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale |date=4 December 2007 |access-date=15 April 2008|work=PISA 2006 |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among people age 25 to 64, 12% have attended higher education, while on average Slovenes have 9.6 years of formal education. According to an OECD report, 83% of adults ages 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a high school degree, well above the OECD average of 74%; among 25- to 34-year-olds, the rate is 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OECD |url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/slovenia/ |title=Slovenia – OECD Better Life Index |publisher=Oecdbetterlifeindex.org |access-date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1991 census there is 99.6% [[literacy]] in Slovenia. [[Lifelong learning]] is also increasing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Primary====
Responsibility for education oversight at primary and secondary level in Slovenia lies with the Ministry of Education and Sports. After non-compulsory pre-school education, children enter the nine-year primary school at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mss.gov.si/si/solstvo/osnovnosolsko_izobrazevanje/osnovna_sola/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221033345/http://www.mss.gov.si/si/solstvo/osnovnosolsko_izobrazevanje/osnovna_sola/|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary school is divided into three periods, each of three years. In the academic year 2006–2007 there were 166,000 pupils enrolled in elementary education and more than 13,225 teachers, giving a ratio of one teacher per 12 pupils and 20 pupils per class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia#Education |title=About Slovenia – Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secondary====
After completing elementary school, nearly all children (more than 98%) go on to secondary education, either vocational, technical or general secondary programmes ([[Gymnasium (school)|gimnazija]]). The latter concludes with [[Matura#Matura in Slovenia|matura]], the final exam that allows the graduates to enter a university. 84% of secondary school graduates go on to tertiary education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Tertiary====
Among several universities in Slovenia, the best ranked is the [[University of Ljubljana]], ranking among the first 500 or the first 3% of the world's best universities according to the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities|ARWU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU-Statistics-2012.html#2 |title=Statistics (by Country) of Academic Ranking of World Universities &amp;#124; Shanghai Ranking |publisher=ARWU |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-lj.si/en/news.aspx?id=7606 |title=University of Ljubljana once again on Shanghai and Webometrics ranking lists |publisher=Uni-lj.si |access-date=4 April 2014 |archive-date=28 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328061623/http://www.uni-lj.si/en/news.aspx?id=7606 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other public universities include the [[University of Maribor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-mb.si/podrocje.aspx?id=0&amp;langID=1060 |title=Univerza v Mariboru |publisher=Uni-mb.si |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]] region and the [[University of Primorska]] in [[Slovene Littoral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upr.si/ |title=Univerza na Primorskem: SLO |publisher=Upr.si |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is a private [[University of Nova Gorica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ung.si/si/ |title=Univerza v Novi Gorici |publisher=Ung.si |access-date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an international [[EMUNI University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emuni.si/en/strani/29/EMUNI-University.html |title=EMUNI University |access-date=13 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222025646/http://www.emuni.si/en/strani/29/EMUNI-University.html |archive-date=22 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritage ===
Slovenia's architectural heritage includes 2,500 churches, 1,000 castles, ruins, and manor houses, farmhouses, and special structures for drying hay, called [[hayrack]]s ({{lang|sl|kozolci}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Planet|first1=Lonely|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4RADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT498|title=Lonely Planet Slovenia|last2=Bain|first2=Carolyn|last3=Fallon|first3=Steve|date=2016-05-01|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-76034-148-0|pages=498|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four natural and cultural sites in Slovenia are on the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list. [[Škocjan Caves]] and its [[karst]] landscape are a protected site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Škocjan Caves mark 30th anniversary of UNESCO listing|url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/skocjan-caves-mark-30th-anniversary-of-unesco-listing|website=The Slovenia Times|access-date=2020-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the old forests in the area of Goteniški Snežnik and Kočevski Rog in the SE Slovenia.

The most picturesque church for photographers is the medieval and Baroque building on [[Lake Bled#Bled Island|Bled Island]]. The castle above the lake is a museum and restaurant with a view. Near [[Postojna]] there is a fortress called [[Predjama Castle]], half hidden in a cave. Museums in Ljubljana and elsewhere feature unique items such as the [[Divje Babe Flute]] and the [[Ljubljana Marshes Wheel|oldest wheel in the world]]. Ljubljana has medieval, Baroque, Art Nouveau, and modern architecture. The architect [[Plečnik]]'s architecture and his innovative paths and bridges along the Ljubljanica are notable and on UNESCO tentative list.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Slovenian cuisine|Slovenian wine}}
[[File:Velika noč - jedila hren šunka pirhi potica.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Slovenian potica|Potica]] as part of traditional Slovenian Easter breakfast]]
Slovenian cuisine is a mixture of Central European cuisine (especially [[Austrian cuisine|Austrian]] and [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]]), [[Mediterranean cuisine]] and [[Balkan cuisine]]. Historically, Slovenian cuisine was divided into town, farmhouse, cottage, castle, parsonage and monastic cuisines. Due to the variety of Slovenian cultural and natural landscapes, there are more than 40 distinct regional cuisines.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Ethnology|Ethnologically]], the most characteristic Slovene dishes were one-pot dishes, such as ''[[ričet]]'', [[Istrian stew]] ({{lang|sl|jota}}), [[minestrone]] ({{lang|sl|mineštra}}), and ''[[žganci]] ''buckwheat spoonbread; in the [[Prekmurje]] region there is also ''[[bujta repa]]'', and ''[[prekmurska gibanica]]'' pastry. Pršut [[prosciutto]] is known as ({{lang|sl|pršut}}) in the [[Slovene Littoral]]. The [[nut roll]] ({{lang|sl|potica}}) has become a symbol of Slovenia, especially among the [[American Slovenes|Slovene diaspora in the United States]]. [[Soup]]s were added to the traditional one-pot meals and various kinds of porridge and stew only in relatively recent history.

Each year since 2000, the [[Roasted Potato Festival]] has been organized by the ''Society for the Recognition of Roasted Potatoes as a Distinct Dish'', attracting thousands of visitors. Roasted potatoes, which have been traditionally served in most Slovenian families only on Sundays—preceded by a meat-based soup, such as beef or chicken soup—have been depicted on a special edition of [[post mark]]s by the [[Post of Slovenia]] on 23 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/7855/Z-zlico-po-Sloveniji?nodeid=534 |title=WebCite query result |access-date=1 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014101214/http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/7855/Z-zlico-po-Sloveniji?nodeid=534 |archive-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known sausage is ''[[kranjska klobasa]]''.

Slovenia has been awarded the [[European Region of Gastronomy]] title for the year 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeanregionofgastronomy.org/platform/slovenia-2021/ |title=Slovenia 2021 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=europeanregionofgastronomy.org |publisher=International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism |access-date=June 10, 2021 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dance ===
Historically the most notable Slovenian ballet dancers and choreographers were [[Pino Mlakar]] (1907‒2006),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dnevnik.si/204038 Umrl baletnik Pino Mlakar], Dnevnik, 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1927 graduated from the [[Rudolf von Laban|Rudolf Laban]] Choreographic Institute, and there met his future wife, balerina [[Pia Mlakar|Maria Luiza Pia Beatrice Scholz]] (1908‒2000). Together they worked as a leading dancer and a choreographer in [[Dessau]] (1930–1932), [[Zürich]] (1934–1938), and State opera in [[München]] (1939‒1944).&lt;ref name="Opera_si"&gt;[http://www.opera.si/sl/o-gledaliscu/balet/pia-in-pino-mlakar/ Pia and Pino Mlakar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606082847/http://www.opera.si/sl/o-gledaliscu/balet/pia-in-pino-mlakar/ |date=6 June 2019 }}, The Slovenian National Theatre Opera and Ballet Ljubljana website&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan to build a Slovenian dance center at [[Rožnik Hill]] after the World War II was supported by the minister of culture, Ferdo Kozak, but was cancelled by his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Branko Miklavc: [https://www.dnevnik.si/205208 Na konec sveta bom potoval, samo da ju še enkrat vidim plesati], Dnevnik, 7 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Pino Mlakar was also a full professor at the [[Academy for Theatre, Radio, Film and Television]] (AGRFT) of the [[University of Ljubljana]].

=== Festivals, book fairs, and other events ===
A number of music, theater, film, book, and children's festivals take place in Slovenia each year, including the music festivals [[Ljubljana Summer Festival]] and [[Lent Festival]], the stand-up comedy [[Punch Festival]], the children's [[Pippi Longstocking Festival]], and the book festivals [[Slovene book fair]] and [[Frankfurt after the Frankfurt]].

The most notable music festival of Slovene music was historically the [[Slovenska popevka]] festival. Between 1981 and 2000 the [[Novi Rock]] festival was notable for bringing rock music across [[Iron curtain]] from the West to the Slovenian and then Yugoslav audience. The long tradition of jazz festivals in [[Titoism|Titoist]] Yugoslavia began with the Ljubljana Jazz Festival which has been held annually in Slovenia since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ljubljanajazz.si/home/ Ljubljana Jazz Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723130107/http://en.ljubljanajazz.si/home/ |date=23 July 2012 }}, an official site (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literary history====
[[File:Prešern-Goldenstein.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[France Prešeren]], best-known Slovenian poet]]

History of [[Slovene literature]] began in the 16th century with [[Primož Trubar]] and [[Protestant Reformation in the Slovene Lands|other Protestant Reformers]]. Poetry in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] achieved its highest level with the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[France Prešeren]] (1800–1849). In the 20th century, the Slovene literary fiction went through several periods: the beginning of the century was marked by the authors of the [[Slovene Modernism]], with the most influential Slovene writer and playwright, [[Ivan Cankar]]; it was then followed by [[expressionism]] ([[Srečko Kosovel]]), avantgardism ([[Anton Podbevšek]], [[Ferdo Delak]]) and [[social realism]] ([[Ciril Kosmač]], [[Prežihov Voranc]]) before World War II, the [[poetry of resistance and revolution]] ([[Karel Destovnik Kajuh]], [[Matej Bor]]) during the war, and [[intimism (Slovene poetry)|intimism]] ([[Poems of the Four]], 1953), [[Slovenian post-war modernism|post-war modernism]] ([[Edvard Kocbek]]), and [[existentialism]] ([[Dane Zajc]]) after the war.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Music of Slovenia]] historically includes numerous musicians and composers, such as the [[Renaissance]] composer [[Jacobus Gallus]] (1550–1591), who greatly influenced Central European classical music, the Baroque composer [[Janez Krstnik Dolar]] (ca. 1620–1673), and the violin virtuoso [[Giuseppe Tartini]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

During the medieval era, secular music was as popular as church music, including wandering [[minnesinger]]s. By the time of [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize. The first Slovenian hymnal, ''[[Eni Psalmi]]'', was published in 1567. This period saw the rise of musicians like [[Jacobus Gallus]] and [[Jurij Slatkonja]].&lt;ref&gt;Oto Luthar ''The land between: a history of Slovenia''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1701, [[Johann Berthold von Höffer]] (1667–1718), a nobleman and amateur composer from Ljubljana, founded the [[Slovenian Philharmonics|Academia Philharmonicorum Labacensis]], as one of the oldest such institutions in Europe, based on Italian models.&lt;ref&gt;George J. Buelow (2004) ''A History of Baroque Music'', p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers of Slovenian [[Lieder]] and [[art song]]s include [[Emil Adamič]] (1877–1936), [[Fran Gerbič]] (1840–1917), [[Alojz Geržinič]] (1915–2008), [[Benjamin Ipavec]] (1829–1908), [[Davorin Jenko]] (1835–1914), [[Anton Lajovic]] (1878–1960), [[Kamilo Mašek]] (1831–1859), [[Josip Pavčič]] (1870–1949), [[Zorko Prelovec]] (1887–1939), and [[Lucijan Marija Škerjanc]] (1900–1973).

In the early 20th century, [[impressionism]] was spreading across Slovenia, which soon produced composers [[Marij Kogoj]] and [[Slavko Osterc]]. Avant-garde [[european classical music|classical music]] arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of [[Uroš Krek]], [[Dane Skerl|Dane Škerl]], [[Primoz Ramovs|Primož Ramovš]] and [[Ivo Petric|Ivo Petrić]], who also conducted the [[Slavko Osterc Ensemble]]. [[Jakob Jez|Jakob Jež]], [[Darijan Božič]], [[Lojze Lebic|Lojze Lebič]] and [[Vinko Globokar]] have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's ''[[L'Armonia (opera)|L'Armonia]]'', an opera.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Modern composers include [[Uros Rojko|Uroš Rojko]], [[Tomaz Svete|Tomaž Svete]], [[Brina Jez-Brezavscek|Brina Jež-Brezavšček]], [[Božidar Kantušer]] and [[Aldo Kumar]]. Kumar's ''Sonata z igro 12'' (''A sonata with a play 12''), a set of variations on a rising [[chromatic scale]], is particularly notable.

The [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] serves as the national opera and ballet house.

====Traditional folk music====
[[Harmony]] singing is a deep rooted tradition in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, [[zither]]s, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In [[Prekmurje|eastern Slovenia]], fiddle and cimbalon bands are called [[velike goslarije]].

====Modern folk (Slovenian country) music====
[[File:Slak lojze.jpg|thumbnail|Folk musician [[Lojze Slak]]]]
From 1952 on, the [[Slavko Avsenik]]'s band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the [[West Germany]], inventing the original "[[Gorenjska|Oberkrainer]]" country sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and in the [[Benelux]], spawning hundreds of [[Alps|Alpine]] orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the [[Slovenian-style polka]] legacy. Many musicians followed Avsenik's steps, including [[Lojze Slak]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.total-slovenia-news.com/lifestyle/316-a-short-guide-to-slovenian-oompah-music Neža Loštrek, A Short Guide to Slovenian Oompah Music" ''Total Slovenian News'' (3 Jan 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT169 Rick March and Dick Blau, ''Polka Heartland: Why the Midwest Loves to Polka'' (Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society, 2015), 169.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0870207235|title = Polka Heartland: Why the Midwest Loves to Polka|last1 = March|first1 = Rick|last2 = Blau|first2 = Dick|date = 20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
