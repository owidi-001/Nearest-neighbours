The '''Houston Astros''' are an American [[professional baseball]] team based in [[Houston]]. The Astros compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]], having moved to the division in 2013 after spending their first 51 seasons in the [[National League]] (NL).&lt;ref name="AstrosSaleMLB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Barry M.|title=Sale of Astros to Jim Crane, move to American League in 2013 approved|url=http://m.astros.mlb.com/news/article/25992120|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media LP|date=November 17, 2011|access-date=August 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912113823/http://m.astros.mlb.com/news/article/25992120|archive-date=September 12, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-18/astros-headed-to-american-league-as-new-team-owner-approved.html|title=Astros Headed to American League as New Team Owner Approved|magazine=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Businessweek]]|date=November 18, 2011|access-date=November 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104010043/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-18/astros-headed-to-american-league-as-new-team-owner-approved.html|archive-date=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Astros were established as the '''Houston Colt .45s''' and entered the National League as an expansion team in {{mlby|1962}} along with the [[New York Mets]]. The current name, reflecting Houston's role as the host of the [[Johnson Space Center]], was adopted three years later, when they moved into the [[Astrodome]], the first domed sports stadium and the so-called "Eighth Wonder of the World." The Astros moved to a new stadium called [[Minute Maid Park]] in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minute Maid Park|url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/ballpark/index.jsp|publisher=Houston Astros|date=September 4, 2015|access-date=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054343/http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/ballpark/index.jsp|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Astros played in the [[National League West|NL West]] division from 1969 to 1993, then the [[National League Central|NL Central]] division from 1994 to 2012, before being moved to the AL West as part of a minor realignment in 2013.

The Astros posted their first winning record in [[1972 MLB season|1972]] and made the playoffs for the first time in [[1980 MLB season|1980]]. The Astros made their first [[World Series]] appearance in [[2005 World Series|2005]] but were swept by the AL [[Chicago White Sox]]. In the following decade, the team embraced [[sabermetrics]] and pioneered new analytical technologies during the early 2010s, transforming from a franchise that lost more than 100 games in three consecutive seasons into a star-studded superteam that won over 100 games in three straight seasons. The Astros won the [[2017 World Series]], their first championship, against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in seven games in the wake of [[Hurricane Harvey]]. Having been defeated by [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]] the following year in the [[2018 American League Championship Series|2018 ALCS]], the Astros returned to the World Series in [[2019 World Series|2019]], losing to the [[Washington Nationals]] in seven games despite putting together a franchise-best [[2019 Houston Astros season|regular season]].

On January 13, 2020, Astros manager [[A. J. Hinch]] and general manager [[Jeff Luhnow]] were suspended by MLB for one year after an investigation confirmed  [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|sign stealing by the Astros]] during their 2017 World Series campaign; both men were fired by the team shortly thereafter. [[Dusty Baker]] was announced as the new manager, and [[James Click]] as the new general manager, on January 29 and February 3, 2020, respectively. During the pandemic-shortened [[2020 MLB season|2020 season]], the Astros again qualified for the playoffs (this time with a losing record), making a run for their fourth consecutive [[American League Championship Series]] appearance after having beaten the [[2020 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] and division rival [[2020 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. However, despite becoming just the second team in the history of baseball to rebound from an 0–3 series deficit, the Astros ultimately fell to the [[2020 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] after seven historically tight games in the [[2020 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

From 1962 through the end of the [[2020 Major League Baseball season|2020 season]], the Astros all-time record is 4,630-4,697 (.496)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Houston Astros Team History &amp; Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/index.shtml|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major League Baseball comes to Texas===

[[File:Houston Buffaloes in 1905.jpg|thumb|1905 [[Houston Buffaloes]] team photo]]
From 1888 until 1961, Houston's professional baseball club was the minor league [[Houston Buffaloes]].  Although expansion from the [[National League]] eventually brought an MLB team to Texas in [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]], Houston officials had been making efforts to do so for years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uhsc/00035/hsc-00035.html|title=George Kirksey Papers|access-date=2008-09-26|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|last=Elston|first=Gene|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927205147/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uhsc/00035/hsc-00035.html|archive-date=2008-09-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were four men chiefly responsible for bringing Major League Baseball to Houston: George Kirksey and Craig Cullinan, who had led a futile attempt to purchase the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 1952; R.E. "Bob" Smith, a prominent oilman and real estate magnate in Houston who was brought in for his financial resources; and Judge [[Roy Hofheinz]], a former Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge who was recruited for his salesmanship and political style. They founded the Houston Sports Association as their vehicle for attaining a big league franchise for the city of Houston.&lt;ref name="AstrosDaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/sound/a.html|title=The Colt .45s|access-date=2008-09-26|publisher=AstrosDaily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913124048/http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/sound/a.html|archive-date=2008-09-13|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given MLB's refusal to consider expansion, Kirksey, Cullinan, Smith, and Hofheinz joined forces with would-be owners from other cities and announced the formation of a new league to compete with the established National and American Leagues. They called the new league the [[Continental League]]. Wanting to protect potential new markets, both existing leagues chose to expand from eight teams to ten. However, plans eventually fell through for the Houston franchise after the Houston Buffaloes owner, [[Marty Marion]], could not come to an agreement with the HSA to sell the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sAleAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6835,871827 |title=Russell Drops Plans to Buy Buff Franchise |publisher=Bonham Daily Favorite |date=January 24, 1960 |access-date=2012-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126002639/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sAleAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wF8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6835,871827 |archive-date=November 26, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To make matters worse, the Continental League as a whole folded in August 1960.

However, on October 17, 1960, the [[National League]] [[1962 Major League Baseball expansion|granted an expansion franchise]] to the Houston Sports Association for them to begin play in the 1962 season.  According to the [[Major League Baseball Constitution]], the Houston Sports Association was required to obtain territorial rights from the Houston Buffaloes in order to play in the Houston area, resulting in the HSA revisiting negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Tm8zAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6954%2C1301938 |title=New York-Houston Get National Franchises |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |date=October 11, 1960 |access-date=November 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125235423/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Tm8zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fe4HAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6954%2C1301938 |archive-date=November 25, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wuhHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1022,1164625 |title=Houston Baseball Muddled for '61 |work=[[The Victoria Advocate]] |date=1960-10-21 |access-date=2013-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125225151/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wuhHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LoAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1022,1164625 |archive-date=2015-11-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the Houston Sports Association succeeded in purchasing the Houston Buffaloes, which were at this point majority-owned by William Hopkins, on January 17, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RlhfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1218,1577109 |title=Houston Will Get Emphasis, Paul Declares |work=[[Observer–Reporter]] |date=1961-01-19 |access-date=2013-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125162147/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RlhfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7VkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1218,1577109 |archive-date=2015-11-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buffs played one last minor league season as the top farm team of the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1961 before being succeeded by the city's NL club.

The new Houston team was named the Colt .45s after a "Name the Team" contest was won by William Irving Neder. The [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt .45]] was well known as "the gun that won the west."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051024&amp;content_id=1258510&amp;vkey=news_hou&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=hou|title=Astros out to make history their history|access-date=2008-10-01|publisher=Houston Astros|last=Herskowitz|first=Mickey|date=2005-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417150533/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051024&amp;content_id=1258510&amp;vkey=news_hou&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=hou|archive-date=2008-04-17|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The colors selected were navy and orange. The first team was formed mostly through an [[1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] after the 1961 season. The Colt .45s and their expansion cousins, the [[New York Mets]], took turns choosing players left unprotected by the other National League franchises.

Many players and staff associated with the Houston Buffaloes organization continued in the major leagues.  Manager [[Harry Craft]], who had joined Houston in 1961, remained in the same position for the team until the end of the [[1964 Houston Colt .45s season|1964 season]].  General manager [[Spec Richardson]] also continued with the organization as business manager but was later promoted back to GM for the Astros from 1967 until 1975.  Although most players for the major league franchise were obtained through the [[1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft]], Buffs players [[J.C. Hartman]], [[Pidge Browne]], [[Jim Campbell (catcher)|Jim Campbell]], [[Ron Davis (outfielder)|Ron Davis]], [[Dave Giusti]], and [[Dave Roberts (first baseman)|Dave Roberts]] were chosen to continue as major league ball players.

Similarly, the radio broadcasting team remained with the new Houston major league franchise.  [[Loel Passe]] worked alongside [[Gene Elston]] as a color commentator until he retired from broadcasting in 1976.  Elston continued with the Astros until 1986.

The Colt .45s began their existence playing at [[Colt Stadium]], a temporary venue built just north of the construction site of the indoor stadium.

===1962–1964: The Colt .45s===
[[File:Al Spangler 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|Colt .45s uniform]]
The Colt .45s started their inaugural season on April 10, 1962, against the [[1962 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] with [[Harry Craft]] as the Colt .45s' manager. [[Bob Aspromonte]] scored the first run for the Colt .45s on an [[Al Spangler]] triple in the first inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196204100.shtml|title=April 10, 1962 Chicago Cubs at Houston Colt .45's Play by Play and Box Score|access-date=2011-08-04|publisher=Sports Reference|last=Ian|first=Fleming|date=2006-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027060629/http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196204100.shtml|archive-date=October 27, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They started the season with a three-game sweep of the Cubs but eventually finished eighth among the National League's ten teams. The team's best pitcher, [[Turk Farrell|Richard "Turk" Farrell]], lost 20 games despite an [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 3.02. A starter for the Colt .45s, Farrell was primarily a relief pitcher prior to playing for Houston. He was selected to both All-Star Games in 1962.

The 1963 season saw more young talent mixed with seasoned veterans. [[Jimmy Wynn]], [[Rusty Staub]], and [[Joe Morgan]] all made their major league debuts in the [[1963 Major League Baseball season|1963 season]]. However, Houston's position in the standings did not improve, as the Colt .45s finished in ninth place with a 66–96 record. The team was still building, trying to find that perfect mix to compete.&lt;ref name="AstrosDaily" /&gt; The 1964 campaign began on a sad note, as relief pitcher [[Jim Umbricht]] died of cancer at the age of 33 on April 8, just before [[Opening Day]].&lt;ref name=jucpdoc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r6FIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3101%2C4638035 |newspaper=Morning Record |location=Meriden, Connecticut |agency=Associated Press |title=Jim Umbricht, Colts pitcher, dies of cancer |date=April 9, 1964 |page=4 |access-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015233250/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r6FIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PQENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3101%2C4638035 |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Umbricht was the only Colt .45s pitcher to post a winning record in Houston's first two seasons.

Just on the horizon, the structure of the new domed stadium was more prevalent and it would soon change the way that baseball was watched in Houston and around the league. On December 1, 1964, the team announced the name change from the Colt .45s to the "Astros."&lt;ref name=hcbaap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bCIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5456%2C4558796 |newspaper=Florence Times |location=Alabama |agency=Associated Press |title=Houston Colts become Astros |date=December 2, 1964 |page=20 |access-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015233250/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bCIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D8gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5456%2C4558796 |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnaupi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_HYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3153%2C238492 |newspaper=Beaver County Times |location=Pennsylvania |agency=UPI |title=Colts now 'Astros' |date=December 2, 1964 |page=16 |access-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015233250/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_HYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=odsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3153%2C238492 |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/history/hou_history_feature.jsp?story=5 |title=Astrodome Houston-Astros.com |publisher=Houston.astros.mlb.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510172846/http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/history/hou_history_feature.jsp?story=5 |archive-date=2013-05-10 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965–1970: The Great Indoors===
With Judge [[Roy Hofheinz]] now the sole owner of the franchise and the new venue complete, the renamed Astros moved into their new domed stadium, the [[Astrodome|''Astro''dome]], in 1965. The name honored Houston's position as the center of the nation's space program- [[NASA]]'s new [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] had recently opened southeast of the city. The Astrodome, coined the "Eighth Wonder of the World", did little to improve the home team's results on the field. While several "indoor" firsts were accomplished, the team still finished ninth in the standings. The attendance was high not because of the team's accomplishments, but because people came from miles around to see the Astrodome.
[[File:Astrodome scoreboard 1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Houston Astrodome]] Scoreboard pictured during a June 7, 1969 game between the Astros and Cardinals]]
[[File:Astrodome 1965.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Astrodome in 1965]]
Just as the excitement was settling down over the Astrodome, the [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966 season]] found something new to put the domed stadium in the spotlight once again – the field. Grass would not grow in the new park, since the roof panels had been painted to reduce the glare that was causing players on both the Astros and the visiting teams to miss routine pop flies. A new artificial turf was created called "[[AstroTurf]]" and Houston would be involved in yet another change in the way the game was played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/ballparks/astrodome/ Astrodome – history, photos and more] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010615/http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/ballparks/astrodome/ |date=2017-10-23 }} Ballparks of Baseball.&lt;/ref&gt;

With new manager [[Grady Hatton]], the Astros started the 1966 season strong. By May they were in second place in the National League and looked like a team that could contend. [[Joe Morgan]] was named as a starter on the [[1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Team]]. The success did not last as they lost [[Jimmy Wynn]] for the season after he crashed into an outfield fence in [[Philadelphia]] and Morgan had broken his knee cap.&lt;ref name="AstrosDaily" /&gt; The [[1967 Houston Astros season|1967 season]] saw first baseman [[Eddie Mathews]] join the Astros. The slugger hit his 500th home run while in Houston. He would be traded late in the season and [[Doug Rader]] would be promoted to the big leagues. Rookie [[Don Wilson (baseball)|Don Wilson]] pitched a no-hitter on June 18. Wynn also provided some enthusiasm in 1967. The 5&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in Wynn was becoming known not only for how often he hit home runs, but also for how far he hit them. Wynn set club records with 37 home runs, and 107 RBIs. It was also in 1967 that Wynn hit his famous home run onto [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/w/wynnj01.shtml Jimmy Wynn Statistics]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Baseball-Reference.com''&lt;/ref&gt; As the season came to a close, the Astros found themselves again in ninth place and with a winning percentage below .500. The team looked good on paper, but could not make it work on the field.

April 15, 1968, saw a pitching duel for the ages. The Astros' [[Don Wilson (baseball)|Don Wilson]] and the Mets' [[Tom Seaver]] faced each other in a battle that lasted six hours. Seaver went ten innings, allowing no walks and just two hits. Wilson went nine innings, allowing five hits and three walks. After the starters exited, eleven relievers (seven for the Mets and four for the Astros) tried to end the game. The game finally ended in the 24th inning when Aspromonte hit a shot toward Mets shortstop [[Al Weis]]. Weis had been perfect all night at short, but he was not quick enough to make the play. The ball zipped into left field, allowing [[Norm Miller (baseball)|Norm Miller]] to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/records_registry12.stm |title=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093725/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/records_registry12.stm |archive-date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With baseball expansion and trades, the Astros had dramatically changed in [[1969 Houston Astros season|1969]]. Aspromonte was sent to the Braves and Staub was traded to the expansion [[Montreal Expos]], in exchange for outfielder [[Jesús Alou]] and first baseman [[Donn Clendenon]].  However, Clendenon refused to report to Houston, electing to retire and take job with a pen manufacturing company. The Astros asked Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] to void the trade, but he refused. Instead, he awarded [[Jack Billingham]] and a left-handed relief pitcher to the Astros to complete the trade. Cuellar was traded to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Curt Blefary]]. Other new players included catcher [[Johnny Edwards (baseball)|Johnny Edwards]], infielder [[Denis Menke]] and pitcher [[Denny Lemaster]]. Wilson continued to pitch brilliantly and on May 1 threw the second no-hitter of his career. In that game, he struck out 18 batters, tying what was then the all-time single-game mark.  He was just 24 years of age and was second to only [[Sandy Koufax]] for career no-hit wins. Wilson's no-hitter lit the Astros' fire after a miserable month of April, and six days later the team tied a major league record by turning seven double plays in a game. By May's end, the Astros had put together a ten-game winning streak. The Houston infield tandem of Menke and Joe Morgan continued to improve, providing power at the plate and great defense. Morgan had 15 homers and stole 49 bases while Menke led the Astros with 90 RBIs. The Menke/Morgan punch was beginning to come alive, and the team was responding to Walker's management style. The Astros dominated the season series against their expansion twins, the New York Mets. In one game at New York, Denis Menke and Jimmy Wynn hit [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]s in the same inning, against a Mets team that would go on to win the World Series that same year. The Astros finished the 1969 season with a record of 81 wins, 81 losses, marking their first season of .500 ball.

In [[1970 Houston Astros season|1970]], the Astros were expected to be a serious threat in the National League West. In June, 19-year-old [[César Cedeño]] was called up and immediately showed signs of being a superstar. The Dominican outfielder batted .310 after being called up. Not to be outdone, Menke batted .304 and [[Jesús Alou]] batted .306. The Astros' batting average was up by 19 points compared to the season before.&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Cesar_Cedeno_1951 |title=The Ballplayers – Cesar Cedeno |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date=1985-08-29 |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093735/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Cesar_Cedeno_1951 |archive-date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team looked good, but the Astros' ERA was up. [[Larry Dierker]] and Wilson had winning records, but the pitching staff as a whole had an off season. Houston finished in fourth place in 1970.

===1971–1974: The boys in orange===
The fashion trends of the 1970s had started taking root in baseball. Long hair and loud colors were starting to appear on team uniforms, including the Astros'. In 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry – polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/ |title=Astros History |publisher=Astrosdaily.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917150939/http://astrosdaily.com/history/ |archive-date=2012-09-17 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniforms were about the only thing that did change in 1971. The acquisition of [[Roger Metzger]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the off-season moved Menke to first base and [[Bob Watson]] to the outfield. The Astros got off to a slow start and the pitching and hitting averages were down. [[Larry Dierker]] was selected to the All-Star Game in 1971, but due to an arm injury he could not make it. [[César Cedeño]] led the club with 81 RBIs and the league with 40 doubles, but batted just .264 and had 102 strikeouts in his second season with the Astros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cedence01.shtml |title=Cesar Cedeno Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228203253/http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cedence01.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-28 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcher [[J. R. Richard]] made his debut in September of the 1971 season against the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]].

====The Big Trade====
[[File:Morgan Joe Houston.jpg|thumb|upright|Hall of Famer [[Joe Morgan]] (1963–1971, 1980) was traded to Cincinnati following the 1971 season]]
{{See also|The Big Red Machine}}
In November [[1971 Houston Astros season|1971]] the Astros and [[Cincinnati Reds]] made one of the biggest blockbuster trades in the history of the sport,&lt;ref name=Hardballtimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Treder|first=Steve|title=Offseason blockbusters: November (Part two: 1966–1981)|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/offseason-blockbusters-november-part-two-1966–1981/|publisher=Hardball Times}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped create The Big Red Machine of the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/mayle01.php |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060507153856/http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/mayle01.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-05-07 |title=Lee May Baseball Stats, facts, biography, images and video. |publisher=The Baseball Page |access-date=2012-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. Houston sent second baseman [[Joe Morgan]], infielder [[Denis Menke]], pitcher [[Jack Billingham]], outfielder [[César Gerónimo]] and prospect [[Ed Armbrister]] to Cincinnati for first baseman [[Lee May]], second baseman [[Tommy Helms]] and infielder [[Jimmy Stewart (baseball)|Jimmy Stewart]]. The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world scratching their heads as to why [[General manager (baseball)|General Manager]] [[Spec Richardson]] would give up so much for so little. The Reds, on the other hand, would shore up many problems. They had an off year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|1972]].&lt;ref name="Hardballtimes" /&gt;

The Astros' acquisition of Lee May added more power to the lineup in [[1972 Houston Astros season|1972]].  May, Wynn, Rader and Cedeño all had 20 or more home runs and Watson hit 16. Cedeño also led the Astros with a .320 batting average, 55 stolen bases and made spectacular plays on the field. Cedeño made his first All-Star game in 1972 and became the first Astros player in team history to hit for the cycle in August versus the Reds.  The Astros finished the strike-shortened season at 84–69, their first winning season.&lt;ref name="AstrosDaily" /&gt;

Astros fans had hoped for more of the same in [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973]], but it was not to be.  The Astros run production was down, even though the same five sluggers the year before were still punching the ball out of the park. Lee May led the Astros with 28 home runs and Cesar Cedeño batted .320 with 25 home runs.  [[Bob Watson]] hit the .312 mark and drove in 94 runs.  [[Doug Rader]] and [[Jimmy Wynn]] both had 20 or more home runs.  However, injuries to their pitching staff limited the Astros to an 82–80 fourth-place finish.  The Astros again finished in fourth place the next year under new manager [[Preston Gómez]].&lt;ref name="AstrosDaily" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho87 |title=Hofheinz, Roy Mark tshonline.org |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= 15 June 2010|access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67qRHxZPu?url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho87 |archive-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975–1979: Cautious corporate ownership===
With the $38&amp;nbsp;million deficit of the Astrodome, control of the Astrodomain (including the Astros)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/McLane-era-represents-Astros-most-stable-1698247.php |title=McLane era represents Astros' most stable ownership |date=18 January 2010 |access-date=2018-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212084555/https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/McLane-era-represents-Astros-most-stable-1698247.php |archive-date=2018-02-12 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed from [[Roy Hofheinz]] to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit. The creditors were just interested in preserving asset value of the team, so any money spent had to be found or saved somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=35 |title=Interview – Tal Smith – Pres.

However, there would be some bright spots that would prove to be good investments in the near future.

The year started on a sad note. Pitcher Don Wilson was found dead in the passenger seat of his car on January 5, 1975; the cause of death was asphyxiation by carbon monoxide. Wilson was 29 years old. Wilson's number 40 was retired on April 13, 1975.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

The 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt; There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;
[[File:Cesar Cedeno - Houston Astros.jpg|thumb|[[Cesar Cedeno]] (1970–1981) is the franchise's all-time leader with 487 [[Stolen base|steals]]]]
Besides the bright new uniforms there were some other changes. [[Lee May]] was traded to [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]] for much talked about rookie second baseman [[Rob Andrews (baseball)|Rob Andrews]] and utility player [[Enos Cabell]]. In Baltimore, Cabell was stuck behind third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], but he took advantage of his opportunity in Houston and became their everyday third baseman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Enos_Cabell_1949 |title=The Ballplayers – Enos Cabell |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093815/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Enos_Cabell_1949 |archive-date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabell would go on to become a big part of the team's success in later years. With May gone, [[Bob Watson]] was able to move to first base and was a bright spot in the line up, batting .324 with 85 RBI.

The two biggest moves the Astros made in the offseason were the acquisitions of [[Joe Niekro]] and [[José Cruz]]. The Astros bought Niekro from the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother [[Phil Niekro]] had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe was just starting to use it when he came to the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Joe_Niekro_1944 |title=The Ballplayers – Joe Niekro |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104011419/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Joe_Niekro_1944 |archive-date=2012-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring [[José Cruz]] from the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] was another big win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hymGG28xYcoC&amp;q=cardinals+sell+cruz+to+astros+for&amp;pg=PA162 |title=Cardinals Encyclopedia – Michael Eisenbath – Google Boeken |date= 1999-05-14|access-date=2012-11-05|isbn=9781566397032|last1=Eisenbath |first1=Mike }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.

Despite high expectations, [[1975 Houston Astros season|1975]] was among the Astros' worst in franchise history. Their record of 64–97 was far worse than even the expansion Colt .45's and would remain the worst record in franchise history until [[2011 Houston Astros season|2011]]. It was the worst record in baseball and manager [[Preston Gómez]] was fired late in the season and replaced by [[Bill Virdon]]. The Astros played .500 ball under Virdon in the last 34 games of the season.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt; With Virdon as the manager the Astros improved greatly in 1976 finishing in third place with an 80–82 record. A healthy [[César Cedeño]] was a key reason for the Astros' success in 1976. [[Bob Watson]] continued to show consistency and led the club with a .313 average and 102 RBI. [[José Cruz]] became Houston's everyday left fielder and hit .303 with 28 stolen bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1976.shtml |title=1976 Houston Astros Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025192002/http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1976.shtml |archive-date=2012-10-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/n/niekrjo01.shtml |title=Joe Niekro Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228132133/http://www.baseball-reference.com/n/niekrjo01.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-28 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1976 saw the end of [[Larry Dierker]]'s playing career as an Astro, but before it was all over he would throw a no-hitter and win the 1,000th game in the Astrodome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydierker.com/index.asp?id=7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528081837/http://larrydierker.com/index.asp?id=7|date=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Astros finished in third place again in [[1977 Houston Astros season|1977]] with a record of 81–81.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

One of the big problems the Astros had in the late 1970s was that they were unable to compete in the free-agent market. Ford Motor Credit Company was still in control of the team and was looking to sell the Astros, but would not spend money on better players. Most of the talent was either farm grown or bought cheaply.

The [[1979 Houston Astros season|1979 season]] would prove to be a big turnaround in Astros history. During the offseason, the Astros attempted to fix some of their problem areas. They traded [[Floyd Bannister]] to [[Seattle Mariners|Seattle]] for shortstop [[Craig Reynolds (baseball)|Craig Reynolds]] and acquired catcher [[Alan Ashby]] from [[Toronto Blue Jays|Toronto]] for pitcher [[Mark Lemongello]]. Reynolds and Ashby were both solid in their positions and gave Houston some much-needed consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1979_trans.shtml |title=1979 Houston Astros Trades and Transactions |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907162816/http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1979_trans.shtml |archive-date=2008-09-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The season started with a boost from pitcher [[Ken Forsch]], who threw a [[no-hitter]] against the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] the second game of the season.&lt;ref name=HOUdaily/&gt; In May 1979, New Jersey shipping tycoon [[John McMullen (engineer)|John McMullen]] had agreed to buy the Astros. Now with an investor in charge, the Astros would be more likely to compete in the free-agent market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/sports/18mcmullen.html | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Goldstein | title=John J.

The Astros were playing great baseball throughout the season. [[José Cruz]] and [[Enos Cabell]] both stole 30 bases. [[Joe Niekro]] had a great year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. [[J. R. Richard]] won 18 games and set a new personal strikeout record at 313. [[Joe Sambito]] came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were going as they should for a team that could win the west.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt; The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89–73 and {{frac|1|1|2}} games behind the NL winner Reds.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

With Dr. McMullen as sole owner of the Astros, the team would now benefit in ways a corporation could not give them. The rumors of the Astros moving out of Houston started to crumble and the Astros were now able to compete in the free-agent market. McMullen showed the city of Houston that he too wanted a winning team, signing nearby [[Alvin, Texas]] native [[Nolan Ryan]] to the first million-dollar-a-year deal. Ryan had four career no-hitters already and had struck out 383 in one season.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily"/&gt;

The 1980 pitching staff was one of the best Houston ever had, with the fastball of Ryan, the knuckleball of [[Joe Niekro]] and the terrifying 6&amp;nbsp;ft 8&amp;nbsp;in frame of [[J. R. Richard]]. Teams felt lucky to face [[Ken Forsch]], who was a double-digit winner in the previous two seasons. Richard became the first Astros pitcher to start an All-Star game. Three days later, Richard was told to rest his arm after a medical examination and on July 30 he collapsed during a workout. He had suffered a stroke after a blood clot in the arm apparently moved to his neck and cut off blood flow to the brain. Surgery was done to save his life, but the Astros had lost their ace pitcher after a 10–4 start with a stingy 1.89 ERA. Richard attempted a comeback, but would never again pitch a big league game.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123684/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Video |date=August 18, 1980 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417045503/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123684/index.htm |archive-date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the loss of Richard and some offensive struggles, the Astros slipped to third place in the division behind the Dodgers and the Reds. They bounced back to first with a ten-game winning streak, but the Dodgers regained a two-game lead before arriving in Houston on September 9.  The Astros won the first two games of the series to tie the Dodgers for the division lead. The Astros went on to win a third game and take the lead- with three games against the Dodgers left.  The Dodgers swept the next series, forcing a one-game playoff the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3043946 |title=One-game playoff history – MLB – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-09-30 |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026023918/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3043946 |archive-date=2012-10-26 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Astros won the playoff game 7–1, and advanced to their first post-season.

The team would face the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the [[1980 National League Championship Series]]. The Phillies sent out [[Steve Carlton]] in game one of the NLCS.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_80nlcs_gm3_phihou |title=Baseball's Best &amp;#124; MLB.com: Programming |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026064554/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_80nlcs_gm3_phihou |archive-date=2012-10-26 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies would win the opener after the Astros got out to a 1–0 third-inning lead. Ken Forsch pitched particularly strong fourth and fifth innings, but [[Greg Luzinski]] hit a sixth-inning two-run bomb to the 300 level seats of [[Veterans Stadium]]. The Phillies added an insurance run on the way to a 3–1 win.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;  Houston bounced back to win games two and three.  Game four went into extra innings, with the Phillies taking the lead and the win in the tenth inning. [[Pete Rose]] started a rally with a one-out single, then Luzinski doubled off the left-field wall and Rose bowled over catcher Bruce Bochy to score the go-ahead run.  The Phillies got an insurance run on the way to tying the series.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;

Rookie Phillies pitcher [[Marty Bystrom]] was sent out by Philadelphia manager [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]] to face veteran [[Nolan Ryan]] in Game Five. The rookie gave up a run in the first inning, then held the Astros at bay until the sixth inning. An Astros lead was lost when [[Bob Boone]] hit a two-out single in the second, but the Astros tied the game in the sixth with an [[Alan Ashby]] single scoring [[Denny Walling]]. Houston took a 5–2 lead in the seventh; however, the Phillies came back with five runs in the inning.  The Astros came back against [[Tug McGraw]] with four singles and two two-out runs. Now in extra innings, [[Garry Maddox]] doubled in [[Del Unser]] with one out to give the Phillies an 8–7 lead. The Astros failed to score in the bottom of the tenth.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_80nlcs_gm5_phihou |title=Baseball's Best &amp;#124; MLB.com: Programming |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026064633/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_gamepage.jsp?story_page=bb_80nlcs_gm5_phihou |archive-date=2012-10-26 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nolan Ryan in Atlanta close-up.jpg|thumb|Astros starting pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] in 1983]]
A 1981 player strike ran between June 12 and August 10. Ultimately, the strike would help the Astros get into the playoffs. [[Nolan Ryan]] and [[Bob Knepper]] picked up steam in the second half of the season. Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter on September 26 and finished the season with a 1.69 ERA. Knepper finished with an ERA of 2.18.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt; In the wake of the strike, Major League Baseball took the winners of each "half" season and set up a best-of-five divisional playoff.  The [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won more games than any other team in the National League, but they won neither half of the strike-divided season.  The [[1981 Houston Astros season|Astros]] finished 61–49 overall, which would have been third in the division behind the Reds and the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]. Advancing to the playoffs as winners of the second half, Houston beat Los Angeles in their first two playoff games at home, but the Dodgers took the next three in Los Angeles to advance to the [[1981 National League Championship Series|NLCS]].

By [[1982 Houston Astros season|1982]], only four players and three starting pitchers remained from the 1980 squad. The Astros were out of pennant contention by August and began rebuilding for the near future. [[Bill Virdon]] was fired as manager and replaced by original Colt .45 [[Bob Lillis]]. [[Don Sutton]] asked to be traded and was sent to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for cash and the team gained three new prospects, including [[Kevin Bass]].  Minor league player [[Bill Doran (second baseman)|Bill Doran]] was called up in September. The Astros finished fourth in the west, but new talent was starting to appear.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;

Before the [[1983 Houston Astros season|1983 season]], the Astros traded [[Danny Heep]] to the Mets for pitcher [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]], a 28-year-old who had struggled with New York. [[Art Howe]] sat out the 1983 season with an injury, forcing [[Phil Garner]] to third and [[Ray Knight]] to first. Doran took over at second, becoming the everyday second baseman for the next seven seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/d/doranbi02.shtml |title=Bill Doran Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201151426/http://www.baseball-reference.com/d/doranbi02.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-01 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Astros finished third in the National League West.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;  The [[1984 Houston Astros season|1984 season]] started off badly when shortstop [[Dickie Thon]] was hit in the head by a pitch and was lost for the season.  In September, the Astros called up rookie [[Glenn Davis (baseball)|Glenn Davis]] after he posted impressive numbers in AAA. The Astros finished in second place.  In [[1985 Houston Astros season|1985]], [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]] learned a new pitch, the split-finger fastball. Scott, who was coming off of a 5–11 season, had found his new pitch and would become one of Houston's most celebrated hurlers. In June, Davis made the starting lineup at first base, adding power to the team. In September, [[Joe Niekro]] was traded to the Yankees for two minor league pitchers and lefty [[Jim Deshaies]]. The Astros finished in fourth place in 1985.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;

===1986–1990: A deep run, and building for the future===
After finishing fourth in 1985, the Astros fired general manager [[Al Rosen]] and manager [[Bob Lillis]]. The former was supplanted by [[Dick Wagner (baseball)|Dick Wagner]], the man whose [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] defeated the Astros to win the 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by [[Hal Lanier]] who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, [[Whitey Herzog]], had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as [[Whiteyball]], took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both of which were characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start, winning 13 of their first 19 contests.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/l/lanieha01.shtml |title=Hal Lanier Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207113348/http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/lanieha01.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-07 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/whitey-ball/ |title=Whitey Ball |publisher=Hardballtimes.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129022031/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/whitey-ball/ |archive-date=2013-01-29 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of the season the Astros acquired outfielder [[Billy Hatcher]] from the Cubs for [[Jerry Mumphrey]]. Lainer also made a change in the pitching staff, going with a three-man rotation to start the season.  This allowed Lanier to keep his three starters ([[Nolan Ryan]], [[Bob Knepper]], and [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]]) sharp and to slowly work in rookie hurler [[Jim Deshaies]]. [[Bill Doran (second baseman)|Bill Doran]] and [[Glenn Davis (baseball)|Glenn Davis]] held down the right side of the field but Lainer rotated the left side.  [[Denny Walling]] and [[Craig Reynolds (baseball)|Craig Reynolds]] faced the right-handed pitchers while [[Phil Garner]] and [[Dickie Thon]] batted against left-handers.  Lainer knew the Astros had talent and he put it to work.&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1986.shtml |title=1986 Houston Astros Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025200659/http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1986.shtml |archive-date=2012-10-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mike Scott Astros.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]] won the 1986 NL [[Cy Young Award]] and [[NLCS MVP]]]]
The Astrodome was host to the [[1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1986 All-Star Game]] in which Astros [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]], [[Kevin Bass]], [[Glenn Davis (baseball)|Glenn Davis]], and [[Dave Smith (pitcher, born 1955)|Dave Smith]] represented the host field.  The Astros kept pace with the NL West after the All-Star break. They went on a streak of five straight come-from-behind wins. Houston swept a key 3-game series over the [[San Francisco Giants]] in late September to clinch the division title.  [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]] took the mound in the final game of the series and pitched a no-hitter – the only time in MLB history that any division was clinched via a no-hitter.  Scott would finish the season with an 18–10 record and a [[Cy Young Award]].&lt;ref name=AstrosDaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/moments/ |title=Real Insight.

The [[1986 National League Championship Series]] against the [[New York Mets]] was noted for its drama and is considered to be one of the greatest postseason series. In Game 3, the Astros were ahead at [[Shea Stadium]], 5–4, in the bottom of the 9th when closer [[Dave Smith (pitcher, born 1955)|Dave Smith]] gave up a two-run home run to [[Lenny Dykstra]], giving the Mets a dramatic 6–5 win.

However, the signature game of the series was Game 6. Needing a win to get to [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]] (who had been dominant in the series) in Game 7, the Astros jumped off to a 3–0 lead in the first inning but neither team would score again until the 9th inning. In the 9th, starting pitcher [[Bob Knepper]] would give up two runs, and once again the Astros would look to Dave Smith to close it out. However, Smith would walk [[Gary Carter]] and [[Darryl Strawberry]], giving up a sacrifice fly to [[Ray Knight]], tying the game. Despite having the go-ahead runs on base, Smith was able to escape the inning without any further damage.

There was no scoring until the 14th inning when the Mets would take the lead on a [[Wally Backman]] single and an error by left fielder [[Billy Hatcher]]. The Astros would get the run back in the bottom of the 14th when Hatcher (in a classic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit one of the most dramatic home runs in [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] history, off the left-field foul pole. In the 16th inning, Darryl Strawberry doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove him home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the inning to take what appeared an insurmountable 7–4 lead. With their season on the line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within 7–6. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however [[Jesse Orosco]] would strike him out, ending the game. At the time the 16-inning game held the record for the longest in MLB postseason history.  The Mets won the series, 4–2.

After the 1986 season, the team had difficulty finding success again. Several changes occurred. The "rainbow" uniforms were phased out, the team electing to keep a five-stripe "rainbow" design on the sleeves. Team favorites [[Nolan Ryan]] and [[José Cruz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrosdaily.com/history/1987/ |title=Houston Astros history – 1987 season |publisher=Astrosdaily.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514193551/http://astrosdaily.com/history/1987/ |archive-date=2013-05-14 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; moved on and the team entered a rebuilding phase.  [[Craig Biggio]] debuted in June 1988, joining new prospects [[Ken Caminiti]] and [[Gerald Young (baseball)|Gerald Young]]. Biggio would become the everyday catcher by 1990.  A trade acquiring [[Jeff Bagwell]] in exchange for [[Larry Andersen]] would become one of the biggest deals in Astros history. Glenn Davis was traded to [[Baltimore]] for [[Curt Schilling]], [[Pete Harnisch]] and [[Steve Finley]] in 1990.

===1991–1999: Fine tuning and first rebranding===
The early 1990s were marked by the Astros' growing discontent with their home, the Astrodome.  After the Astrodome was renovated for the primary benefit of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Houston Oilers]] (who shared the Astrodome with the Astros since the 1960s), the Astros began to grow increasingly disenchanted with the facility. Faced with declining attendance at the Astrodome and the inability of management to obtain a new stadium, in the {{baseball year|1991}} off-season Astros management announced its intention to sell the team and move the franchise to the Washington, D.C. area. However, the move was not approved by other National League owners, thus compelling the Astros to remain in Houston. Shortly thereafter, McMullen (who also owned the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]]) sold the team to Texas businessman [[Drayton McLane, Jr.|Drayton McLane]] in 1993, who committed to keeping the team in Houston.

Shortly after McLane's arrival, which coincided with the maturation of Bagwell and Biggio, the Astros began to show signs of consistent success. After finishing second in their division in 1994 (in a [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike year]]), 1995, and 1996, the Astros won consecutive division titles in 1997, 1998, and 1999. In the 1998 season, the Astros set a team record with 102 victories. However, each of these titles was followed by a first-round playoff elimination, in [[1998 National League Division Series|1998]] by the [[San Diego Padres]] and in [[1997 National League Division Series|1997]] and [[1999 National League Division Series|1999]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The manager of these title teams was [[Larry Dierker]], who had previously been a broadcaster and pitcher for the Astros. During this period, Bagwell, Biggio, [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]], and Sean Berry earned the collective nickname "[[Killer B's (Houston Astros)|The Killer Bs]]". In later seasons, the name came to include other Astros, especially [[Lance Berkman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=4551|title= Prospectus Notebook: Astros, Blue Jays|author= Haller, Dave|date= October 20, 2005|work= [[Baseball Prospectus]]|access-date= March 8, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131009060644/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=4551|archive-date= October 9, 2013|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the {{baseball year|1993}} season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The "Astros" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, "flying" star with an open left end. It marked the first time since the team's inception that orange was not part of the team's colors. Despite general agreement that the rainbow uniforms identified with the team had become tired (and looked too much like a minor league team according to the new owners), the new uniforms and caps were never especially popular with many Astros fans.
[[File:Astros clinch playoff berth!.jpg|thumb|300px|Final Astros regular season game in the Astrodome on October 3, 1999]]
Off the field, in 1994, the Astros hired one of the first [[African American]] general managers, former franchise player [[Bob Watson]]. Watson would leave the Astros after the 1995 season to become general manager of the [[New York Yankees]] and helped to lead the Yankees to a [[1996 World Series|World Championship]] in 1996. He would be replaced by [[Gerry Hunsicker]], who until 2004 would continue to oversee the building of the Astros into one of the better and most consistent organizations in the Major Leagues.

However, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) wanted his team out of the Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium.  When things did not progress quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to [[Northern Virginia]]. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish.  Houston voters, having already lost the [[Houston Oilers]] in a similar situation, responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.

===2000–2004: New ballpark and second rebranding===
The 2000 season saw a move to a new stadium. Originally to be named ''The Ballpark at Union Station'' due to being located on the site of [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]], it was renamed ''[[Enron Field]]'' by the season opening after the naming rights were sold to energy corporation [[Enron]]. The stadium was to feature a retractable roof, a particularly useful feature with unpredictable Houston weather. The ballpark also featured more intimate surroundings than the Astrodome. In 2002, naming rights were purchased by Houston-based [[Minute Maid]], after [[Enron]] went bankrupt. The park was built on the grounds of the old [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]]. A locomotive moves across the outfield and whistles after home runs, paying homage to a Houston history which had 11 railroad company lines running through the city by 1860. The ballpark previously contained quirks such as "Tal's Hill", which was a hill in deep center field on which a flagpole stood, all in fair territory. Over the years, many highlight reel catches have been made by center fielders running up the hill to make catches. Tal's Hill was removed in the 2016–2017 offseason and the center field wall was moved in to {{convert|409|ft}}, which the team hoped would generate more home runs.

With the change in location also came a change in attire. Gone were the blue and gold uniforms of the 1990s in favor of a more "[[retro]]" look with pinstripes, a traditional baseball font, and the colors of brick red, sand and black. These colors were chosen because ownership originally wanted to rename the team the '''Houston Diesels'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Creamer|first1=Chris|title=Astros rebrand in 2013?

[[File:Minute Maid Park 2010.JPG|thumb|The Astros moved into Minute Maid Park in 2000]]
After two fairly successful seasons without a playoff appearance, the Astros were early favorites to win the 2004 NL pennant. They added star pitcher [[Andy Pettitte]] to a roster that already included standouts like [[Lance Berkman]] and [[Jeff Kent]] as well as veterans Bagwell and Biggio. [[Roger Clemens]], who had retired after the {{baseball year|2003}} season with the [[New York Yankees]], agreed to join former teammate Pettitte on the Astros for 2004. The one-year deal included unique conditions, such as the option for Clemens to stay home in Houston on select road trips when he wasn't scheduled to pitch.  Despite the early predictions for success, the Astros had a mediocre 44–44 record at the All-Star break. A lack of run production and a poor record in close games were major issues. After being booed at the 2004 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] held in Houston, manager [[Jimy Williams]] was fired and replaced by [[Phil Garner]], a star on the division-winning 1986 Astros. The Astros enjoyed a 46–26 record in the second half of the season under Garner and earned the NL wild-card spot.  The Astros defeated the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] 3–2 in the [[2004 National League Division Series|Division Series]], but would lose the [[2004 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.  Clemens earned a record seventh Cy Young Award in 2004. Additionally, the mid-season addition of [[Carlos Beltrán]] in a trade with the [[Kansas City Royals]] helped the Astros tremendously in their playoff run. Despite midseason trade rumors, Beltrán would prove instrumental to the team's hopes, hitting eight home runs in the postseason. Though he had asserted a desire to remain with the Astros, Beltrán signed a long-term contract with the [[New York Mets]] on January 9, 2005.

===2005: First World Series played in Texas===
{{Main|2005 Houston Astros season}}

In 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15–30 record in late May. The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with "RIP 2005 Astros". However, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42–17 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single-month record in the club's history at 22–7. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months.  The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by [[Roy Oswalt]] (20–12, 2.94), [[Andy Pettitte]] (17–9, 2.39), and [[Roger Clemens]] (13–8 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87). The contributions of the other starters—[[Brandon Backe]] (10–8, 4.76) and rookie starters [[Ezequiel Astacio]] (3–6, 5.67) and [[Wandy Rodríguez]] (10–10, 5.53)—were less remarkable, but enough to push the Astros into position for a playoff run. The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular season, becoming the first team since the world champion 1914 Boston Braves to qualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}
[[File:Houston Astros 2005 NL Championship Banner.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|2005 National League championship banner at Minute Maid Park]]
The Astros won the [[2005 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]], 3–1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6–1, [[Lance Berkman]] hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6–5. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher [[Brad Ausmus]] hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the 15th inning, [[Roger Clemens]] made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out [[Julio Franco]], at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]], hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7–6. Oddly enough, a fan in the left field "Crawford Boxes" in left field who had previously caught Berkman's grand slam also caught Burke's home run. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} The [[2005 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] featured a rematch of the [[2004 National League Championship Series|2004 NLCS]]. The Astros lost the first game in [[St. Louis]], but would win the next three games. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to [[Albert Pujols]], forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. [[Roy Oswalt]] was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2–0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Current honorary NL President William Y. Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy. Warren Giles, William's father and President of the National League from {{baseball year|1951}} to {{baseball year|1969}}, had awarded an MLB franchise to the city of Houston in 1960. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Astros faced the [[Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 World Series|World Series]]. Chicago had been considered the slight favorite but would win all four games, the first two at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in [[Chicago]] and the final two in Houston. Game 3 marked the first World Series game held in the state of Texas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 5 hours and 41 minutes.

This World Series was marked by a controversy involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB and Commissioner Bud Selig insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open, which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borden|first1=Sam|title=THE ROOF STAYS OPEN AS MLB CLOSES CASE|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/roof-stays-open-mlb-closes-case-article-1.616342|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=1 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132936/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/roof-stays-open-mlb-closes-case-article-1.616342|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2009: The decline===
In the 2006 offseason, the team signed [[Preston Wilson]] and moved Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure of Jeff Bagwell. The Astros renewed the contract with Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for left-handed hitter [[Aubrey Huff]]. By August, Preston Wilson complained about his playing time after the return of [[Luke Scott (baseball)|Luke Scott]] from AAA Round Rock. The Astros released Wilson and he was signed by St. Louis. A dramatic season end included wins in 10 of their last 12 games, but the Astros missed a playoff appearance when they lost the final game of the season to the Atlanta Braves.

On October 31, the Astros declined a contract option on [[Jeff Bagwell]] for 2007, ending his 15-year Astros career and leading to his retirement. [[Roger Clemens]] and [[Andrew Pettitte|Andy Pettitte]] filed for free agency.  On December 12, the Astros traded [[Willy Taveras]], [[Taylor Buchholz]], and [[Jason Hirsh]] to the [[Colorado Rockies]] for Rockies pitchers [[Jason Jennings]] and [[Miguel Asencio]]. A trade with the White Sox, involving the same three Astros in exchange for Jon Garland, had been nixed a few days earlier when Buchholz reportedly failed a physical. In the end, Taveras continued to develop and Hirsh had a strong 2007 rookie campaign, while Jennings was often injured and generally ineffective.

[[File:Orlando Palmeiro 2007.jpg|thumb|Astros' outfielder [[Orlando Palmeiro]], 2007]]
On April 28, 2007, the Astros purchased the contract of top minor league prospect [[Hunter Pence]]. He debuted that night, getting a hit and scoring a run. By May 2007, the Astros had suffered one of their worst losing streaks (10 games). On June 28, second baseman [[Craig Biggio]] became the 27th MLB  player to accrue 3,000 career hits. Biggio needed three hits to reach 3,000 and ended the night with a total of five hits. That night, [[Carlos Lee]] hit a towering walk-off grand slam in the 11th inning. Lee later quipped to the media that "he had hit a walk-off grand slam and he got second billing", considering Biggio's achievement. On July 24, Biggio announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He hit a grand slam in that night's game which broke a 3–3 tie and led to an Astros win. In Biggio's last at bat, he grounded out to [[Chipper Jones]] of the Atlanta Braves.

On September 20, [[Ed Wade]] was named [[General Manager]]. In his first move, he traded [[Jason Lane]] to the Padres on September 24. On September 30, Craig Biggio retired after twenty years with the team. In November, the Astros traded RHP [[Brad Lidge]] and SS [[Eric Bruntlett]] to the Philadelphia Phillies for OF [[Michael Bourn]], RHP [[Geoff Geary]], and minor leaguer [[Mike Costanzo]]. [[Utility player (baseball)|Utility player]] [[Mark Loretta]] accepted Houston's salary arbitration and [[Kazuo Matsui]] finalized a $16.5&amp;nbsp;million, three-year contract with the team.  In December, the Astros traded OF [[Luke Scott (baseball)|Luke Scott]], RHP [[Matt Albers]], RHP [[Dennis Sarfate]], LHP [[Troy Patton]], and minor-league 3B [[Mike Costanzo]], to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for SS [[Miguel Tejada]]. On December 14, they sent infielder [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]], RHP [[Juan Gutiérrez (baseball)|Juan Gutiérrez]], and RHP [[Chad Qualls]] to the Arizona Diamondbacks for RHP [[José Valverde]]. On December 27, the Astros came to terms on a deal with All-Star, Gold Glove winner [[Darin Erstad]].

In January and February 2008, the Astros signed [[Brandon Backe]], [[Ty Wigginton]], [[Dave Borkowski]] and [[Shawn Chacón]] to one-year deals. The starting rotation would feature [[Roy Oswalt]] and Brandon Backe as numbers one and two. [[Wandy Rodríguez]], Chacón and [[Chris Sampson]] rounded out the bottom three slots in the rotation. [[Woody Williams]] had retired after a 0–4 spring training and [[Jason Jennings]] was now with Texas. On the other side of the roster, the Astros would start without Kazuo Matsui, who was on a minor league rehab assignment after a spring training injury.

The Astros regressed in 2008 and 2009, finishing with records of 86–75 and 74–88, respectively.  Manager [[Cecil Cooper]] was fired after the 2009 season. At the lowest point of the regression, child admission was free.

===2010–2014: Last years in the NL and move to the AL West===
The 2010 season was the first season as Astros manager for [[Brad Mills (manager)|Brad Mills]], who was previously the bench coach of the [[Boston Red Sox]].  The Astros struggled throughout a season that was marked by trade-deadline deals that sent longtime Astros to other teams.  On July 29, the Astros' ace starting pitcher, [[Roy Oswalt]], was dealt to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for [[J. A. Happ]] and two minor league players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Source: Oswalt headed to Phillies |date=29 July 2010 |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/roy-oswalt-philadelphia-phillies-072910 |access-date=2011-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103458/http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/roy-oswalt-philadelphia-phillies-072910 |archive-date=2012-06-01 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oswalt accepts trade to Phillies |date = 29 July 2010|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5420095 |access-date=2011-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015205633/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5420095 |archive-date=2011-10-15 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 31, outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] for minor leaguers [[Jimmy Paredes]] and [[Mark Melancon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2010/07/31/yankees-make-berkman-trade-official |title=Yankees make Berkman Deal Official |publisher=Yankees.lhblogs.com |date=July 31, 2010 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803181823/http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2010/07/31/yankees-make-berkman-trade-official/ |archive-date=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=McTaggart |url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100730&amp;content_id=12811944&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Astros finalize Berkman deal with Yankees |publisher=Pressbox.mlb.com |date=July 30, 2010 |access-date=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926221336/http://pressbox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100730&amp;content_id=12811944&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |archive-date=September 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Astros finished with a record of 76–86.

On July 30, 2011, the Astros traded OF [[Hunter Pence]], the team's 2010 leader in home runs, to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  On July 31, they traded OF [[Michael Bourn]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]].  On September 17, the Astros recorded their first 100-loss season in franchise history, ending the season eleven days later with an 8–0 home loss to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  Cardinals pitcher [[Chris Carpenter]] pitched a two-hit complete game shutout. The Cardinals would go on to win the National League Wild Card, before beating the Texas Rangers in the World Series. [[Lance Berkman]], who was now a Cardinal, was a key player in their championship victory. The Astros finished with a record of 56–106, the worst single-season record in franchise history (a record which would be broken the following season).

In November 2010, Drayton McLane announced that the Astros were being put up for sale. McLane stated that because the Astros were one of the few franchises in Major League Baseball with only one family as the owners, he was planning his estate. McLane was 75 years old as of November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/sports&amp;id=7798988 |title=Owner Drayton McLane officially puts the Houston Astros up for sale &amp;#124; abc13.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2010-11-19 |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124064447/http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news%2Fsports&amp;id=7798988 |archive-date=2010-11-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2011, local Houston businessman [[Jim Crane]] emerged as the front-runner to purchase the franchise. In the 1980s, Crane founded an air freight business which later merged with [[CEVA Logistics]], and later founded Crane Capital Group. McLane and Crane had a previous handshake agreement for the franchise in 2008, but Crane abruptly changed his mind and broke off discussions. Crane also attempted to buy the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 2008 and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] during their 2010 bankruptcy auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/McLane-close-in-deal-to-sell-Astros-to-Jim-Crane-1687865.php |title=McLane 'close' in deal to sell Astros to Jim Crane – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=2011-03-25 |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029105654/http://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/McLane-close-in-deal-to-sell-Astros-to-Jim-Crane-1687865.php |archive-date=2012-10-29 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crane came under scrutiny because of previous allegations of discriminatory hiring practices regarding women and minorities, among other issues. This delayed MLB's approval process. During the summer of 2011, a frustrated Crane hinted that the delays might threaten the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/09/08/frustrated-jim-crane-feels-offended-impatient-in-astros-sale-process/ |title=Frustrated Jim Crane 'offended' by speculation about delays in Astros sale process |publisher=Blog.chron.com |date=2011-09-08 |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029113845/http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/09/08/frustrated-jim-crane-feels-offended-impatient-in-astros-sale-process/ |archive-date=2012-10-29 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Crane met personally with MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]], in a meeting that was described as "constructive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jim Crane has 'constructive' meeting with Bud Selig |first=Zachary |last=Levine |url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/10/10/jim-crane-has-constructive-meeting-with-bud-selig/ |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=October 10, 2011 |access-date=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228002432/http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/10/10/jim-crane-has-constructive-meeting-with-bud-selig/ |archive-date=December 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2011, it was announced that Crane had agreed to move the franchise to the American League for the 2013 season. The move was part of an overall divisional realignment of MLB, with the National and American leagues each having 15 teams in three geographically balanced divisions. Crane was given a $70&amp;nbsp;million concession by MLB for agreeing to the switch; the move was a condition for the sale to the new ownership group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Houston Astros To The American League: MLB Gives New Owner A $70 Million Discount, According To Reports |url=http://houston.sbnation.com/houston-astros/2011/11/16/2566458/houston-astros-to-the-american-league-mlb-gives-new-owner-a-70 |newspaper=SB Nation |access-date=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126044946/http://houston.sbnation.com/houston-astros/2011/11/16/2566458/houston-astros-to-the-american-league-mlb-gives-new-owner-a-70 |archive-date=January 26, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, the Astros were officially sold to Crane after the other owners unanimously voted in favor of the sale.&lt;ref name="AstrosSaleMLB"/&gt; It was also announced that 2012 would be the last season for the Astros in the NL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111117&amp;content_id=25996382&amp;vkey=news_hou&amp;c_id=hou |title=Astros bring welcome change to American League West &amp;#124; astros.com: News |publisher=Houston.astros.mlb.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510202112/http://houston.astros.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111117&amp;content_id=25996382&amp;vkey=news_hou&amp;c_id=hou |archive-date=2013-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After over fifty years of the Astros being a part of the National League, this move was unpopular with many Astros fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Astros' sale finalized; 2 more for playoffs |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7246443/houston-astros-sale-approved-mlb |newspaper=ESPN.com |date=November 18, 2011 |access-date=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410031253/http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7246443/houston-astros-sale-approved-mlb |archive-date=April 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Local attorney says Astros' move to AL violates lease agreement |first=Steve |last=Campbell |url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/11/16/local-attorney-says-astros-move-to-al-violates-lease-agreement/ |newspaper=Houston Chronicle (Ultimate Astros blog) |date=November 16, 2011 |access-date=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102613/http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/11/16/local-attorney-says-astros-move-to-al-violates-lease-agreement/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Astros were eliminated from the playoffs before September 5. On September 27, the Astros named [[Bo Porter]] to be the manager for the 2013 season.

On October 3, the Astros ended over 50 years of NL play with a 5–4 loss to the Chicago Cubs and began to look ahead to join the American League. Winning only 20 road games during the entire season, the Astros finished with a 55–107 record, the worst record in all of Major League Baseball for the 2012 season, and surpassing the 2011 season for the worst record in Astros history.

On November 2, 2012, the Astros unveiled their new look in preparation for their move to the American League for the 2013 season. The navy and orange uniform returned to the original 1960s team colors, and debuted a new version of the classic navy hat with a white "H" over an orange star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McTaggart|first=Brian|title=Astros, fans celebrate unveiling of team's new look|url=http://m.astros.mlb.com/news/article/40159356/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|date=November 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814185952/http://m.astros.mlb.com/news/article/40159356/|archive-date=August 14, 2016|access-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2012, the Astros hired former Cleveland Indians director of baseball operations [[David Stearns]] as the team's new assistant general manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/stearns-hired-astros-assistant-gm-232452960--mlb.html |title=Stearns hired as Astros' assistant GM |work=[[Yahoo!

The Houston Astros played their first game as an American League team on March 31, 2013, where they were victorious over their in-state division competitor, the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], with a score of 8–2.

On May 17, [[Reid Ryan]], son of [[Nolan Ryan]] was introduced as  president of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/05/17/nolan-ryans-oldest-son-named-astros-president/|title=Nolan Ryan's Oldest Son Named Astros President|work=[[WBBM-TV]]|date=May 18, 2013|access-date=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On September 29, the Astros completed their first year in the American League, losing 5–1 in a 14-inning game to the New York Yankees. The Astros finished the season with a 51–111 record (a franchise-worst) with a season-ending 15-game losing streak, again surpassing their worst record from the previous season. The team finished 45 games behind the division winner [[Oakland Athletics]], further adding to their futility. This marked three consecutive years that the Astros had lost more than 100 games in a single season. They also became the first team to have the first overall pick in the draft three years in a row.

In February 2014, [[Nolan Ryan]] rejoined the Astros front office as assistant to owner [[Jim Crane]], GM [[Jeff Luhnow]] and president of business operations [[Reid Ryan]]. From 2004 through 2008 he worked as a special assistant to the GM.

For the [[2014 Houston Astros season|2014 season]] the team went 70–92, finishing 28 games back of the division winner [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], and placing fourth in the AL West over the Texas Rangers.

[[A.J.

In 2015, [[Dallas Keuchel]] led the AL with 20 victories, going 15–0 at home, an MLB record. Key additions to the team included Scott Kazmir and SS [[Carlos Correa]] who hit 22 home runs after being called up in June 2015. Second baseman [[José Altuve]] remained the star of the Astros' offense. On July 30, the Astros picked up [[Mike Fiers]] and [[Carlos Gómez]] from the Milwaukee Brewers. Fiers threw the 11th [[no-hitter]] in Astros history on August 21 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Houston got the final AL playoff spot and faced the Yankees in the [[2015 American League Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]] on October 6 at New York. They defeated the Yankees 3–0, but lost to the Kansas City Royals in the [[2015 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]].

The Astros split the first two games of the ALDS best-of-five series in Kansas City. The Astros won the first game at Minute Maid to take a 2–1 lead in the ALDS. In Game 4, after 7 innings, the Astros had a 6–2 lead. In the top half of the eighth inning, which took about 45 minutes to end, the Royals had taken a 7–6 lead with a series of consecutive base hits. The Astros suffered a 9–6 loss and the ALDS was tied at 2–2. Then the series went back to Kansas City, where the Royals clinched the series in the fifth game, 7–2.

The Astros entered the 2016 season as the favorites to win the AL West after a promising 2015 season. After a bad start to their season, going just 7–17 in April, the Astros bounced back and went on to have a winning record in their next four months, including an 18–8 record in June. But after going 12–15 in September, the Astros were eliminated from playoff contention. They finished in third place in the American League West Division with a final record of 84–78.

The season was marked by the Astros 4–15 record against their in-state division rival (and eventual division winner) [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. The Astros finished the 2016 season 11 games behind the Rangers.

The Astros entered the All-Star Break with an American League-best 60–29 record, a 16-game lead in the division, and one game shy of the best record in MLB, which had just barely slipped to the Dodgers right before the All-Star Break.

The Astros clinched their first division title as a member of the American League West division, and first division title overall since 2001. They also became the first team in Major League history to win three different divisions: National League West in 1980 and 1986, National League Central from 1997 to 1999 and 2001, and American League West in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/AL-West-champs-Astros-clinch-first-division-12204590.php|title=The West is won: Astros clinch first division title since 2001|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2018-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330012731/https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/AL-West-champs-Astros-clinch-first-division-12204590.php|archive-date=2018-03-30|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, the Astros won their 100th game of the season, the second time the Astros finished a season with over 100 wins, the first being in 1998.

The Astros defeated the Red Sox three games to one, and advanced to the [[American League Championship Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]]. The Astros won the ALCS four games to three, and advanced to the [[2017 World Series|World Series]] to play against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

The victory was especially meaningful for the Houston area, which was rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/us/hurricane-harvey-houston-astros.html 9 Weeks After Harvey, Houston Celebrates World Series Win]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Houston celebrated the team's accomplishment with a parade on the afternoon of November 3, 2017.

On November 16, 2017, [[José Altuve]] was named the American League Most Valuable Player, capping off a season in which he accumulated 200 hits for the fourth consecutive season, led the majors with a .346 BA, and was the unquestioned clubhouse leader of the World Series champions.

On September 26, 2018, the Astros' second consecutive AL West division championship was clinched with a victory by the [[Seattle Mariners]] over the [[Oakland A's]]. For the third time in franchise history, and second consecutive season, the team won over 100 games; they finished the regular season 103–59 (a new franchise record) by sweeping a double-header against the [[Baltimore Orioles]] on September 29, 2018. The Astros swept the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the ALDS to advance to the ALCS to face the league-leading [[Boston Red Sox]] (who finished the season 108–54.) After a 7–2 victory in Game 1 of the ALCS, the Astros dropped the next four games, and Boston advanced to the World Series.

At the trade deadline on July 31, 2019, Houston acquired another veteran starting pitcher and Cy Young award winner [[Zack Greinke]] to bolster the starting rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/mlb-trade-deadline-greinke-astros|title=Houston Astros acquire Zack Greinke in stunning deadline pitching grab|date=July 31, 2019|access-date=September 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905012509/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/31/mlb-trade-deadline-greinke-astros|archive-date=September 5, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, the Astros clinched their third consecutive AL West division title. They finished the season with a record of 107–55, the best in franchise history, and the best record in MLB. They became the first team since the 2002–2004 New York Yankees to have 3 consecutive 100-win seasons. They also became the first team in MLB history to have three consecutive 100-loss seasons and three consecutive 100-win seasons in the same decade.

Entering the playoffs as the top-seeded team in both leagues, they defeated the AL Wild Card winner [[Tampa Bay Rays]] in five games in the ALDS, advancing to the ALCS for the third year in a row to face the New York Yankees. In Game 6 at Minute Maid Park, Jose Altuve hit a walk-off home run to win the pennant and send the team to its third World Series appearance. However, they lost the 2019 World Series to the [[Washington Nationals]] in seven games, taking three games in Washington but losing all four of their games at home.

====Sign stealing scandal====

{{main|Houston Astros sign stealing scandal}}
On November 12, 2019, [[Ken Rosenthal]] and Evan Drellich wrote an article in ''[[The Athletic]]'' detailing allegations that the Astros had used cameras to engage in potentially illicit [[sign stealing]] against opponents, relying on allegations from former Astros pitcher [[Mike Fiers]] as a public source and other allegations from unnamed sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theathletic.com/1363451/2019/11/12/the-astros-stole-signs-electronically-in-2017-part-of-a-much-broader-issue-for-major-league-baseball/ The Astros stole signs electronically in 2017 — part of a much broader issue for Major League Baseball]&lt;/ref&gt; The Astros were alleged to have used scouts watching catchers' signs in real time behind the dugout at Minute Maid Park to crack the signs and banging a trash can loudly to indicate what kind of pitch was coming. The scandal rippled through the baseball world as videos that appeared to clearly show the scheme were published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxnews.com/sports/astros-video-sign-stealing-allegations-2017 Video shows how Houston Astros were allegedly stealing signs during 2017 season]&lt;/ref&gt; Further allegations regarding other means of relaying signs, such as whistling, surfaced in subsequent weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxnews.com/sports/astros-video-sign-stealing-whitstling-world-series New video shows how Houston Astros allegedly used whistles to tip pitches to batters]&lt;/ref&gt; MLB and [[Major League Baseball Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Rob Manfred]] announced a sweeping investigation into the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/sports/baseball/mlb-astros-signs-investigation.html The Astros Investigation Is Making the Off-Season Awkward for Everyone] (NY Times)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2020, MLB announced that its investigation found that the Astros did use cameras and video monitors to steal signs of opposing catchers and signal to hitters throughout the 2017 regular season and postseason, and at least part of the 2018 season.&lt;ref name="WP1132020"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/01/13/houston-astros-penalties-sign-stealing/ A.J. Hinch and Jeff Luhnow fired by Astros after MLB suspension, fine in sign-stealing scandal]&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation found no evidence of sign stealing in their pennant-winning 2019 season.&lt;ref name="CBS11520"&gt;[https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/houston-astros-cheating-scandal-10-things-we-learned-from-mlbs-nine-page-investigative-report/ Houston Astros cheating scandal: 10 things we learned from MLB's nine-page investigative report]&lt;/ref&gt; The report said that [[Alex Cora]], then the Astros bench coach, [[Carlos Beltrán]], and other unnamed players were involved in developing the scheme. It said Hinch "neither devised the banging scheme nor participated in it," but did not stop it or tell Cora he disapproved of it.&lt;ref name="CBS11520"/&gt;

Manfred announced that manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended for one year, the team would be fined $5&amp;nbsp;million (the maximum allowed under MLB rules), and the team would lose its top two draft picks in both the 2020 and 2021 [[MLB Draft]]s.&lt;ref name="WP1132020"/&gt; About an hour after MLB's announcement, Astros owner Jim Crane announced he had terminated both Hinch and Luhnow, saying he was unaware of the scheme and "extraordinarily troubled and upset", and concluded, "We need to move forward with a clean slate. [We] will not have this happen again on my watch."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khou.com/article/sports/mlb/astros/astros-manager-aj-hinch-gm-jeff-luhnow-suspended-for-a-year-as-mlb-comes-down-hard-for-cheating-allegations/285-d80c4626-2bb1-4fc4-89d4-26ea0a30bf87 Astros owner fires Jeff Luhnow, A.J. Hinch after both were suspended by MLB for 2017 cheating scandal]&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Luhnow denied knowledge of the scheme. Hinch issued a statement saying, "While the evidence consistently showed I didn’t endorse or participate in the sign stealing practices, I failed to stop them and I am deeply sorry."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-statement-from-aj-hinch Statement from AJ Hinch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal had repercussions around baseball. Cora was implicated in the report but Manfred withheld a decision on his punishment until the completion of a separate investigation into electronic sign stealing in 2018, when Cora was manager of the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2020/01/13/red-soxs-alex-cora-is-going-to-get-crushed-after-astros-cheating-scandal/ Red Sox’s Alex Cora is going to get crushed after Astros cheating scandal]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report led the Red Sox to dismiss Cora two days after it was published,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/01/15/boston-red-sox-fire-alex-cora Why Red Sox Had to Move on From Alex Cora]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mets did the same with Beltran, who had been hired as manager shortly before the original story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28496773/mets-agree-part-ways-manager-carlos-beltran Mets agree to part ways with manager Carlos Beltran]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2020, the Astros announced they hired [[Dusty Baker]] as their new manager to replace Hinch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/01/29/dusty-baker-houston-astros-mlb-manager/4613200002/ Dusty Baker named Houston Astros manager: Veteran skipper takes over in wake of club's cheating scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28594178/astros-hire-dusty-baker-short-term-deal-new-manager Astros hire Dusty Baker to short-term deal as new manager]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniforms==
===1962–1964: The Colt .45's===
Houston's MLB franchise debuted as the Colt .45s in 1962, and the original home uniforms featured a navy pistol with orange smoke coming out of the barrel to form the "C" in "Colts". The road uniforms featured the city name written in navy block letters with orange trim, and the [[flag of Texas]] patch was placed on the left sleeve. Caps were all-navy featuring ".45s" in orange letters in front.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt;

===1965–1974: Shooting stars===
Renamed the Astros and moving to the Astrodome in 1965, they took to the field in home uniforms featuring the "shooting star" design. The uniforms initially featured "Astros" in navy with orange trim, and the cap now sported an orange star with "H" in block serif letters. The road uniforms remained the same save for the Astros logo replacing the Texas flag (the same logo was also applied on the home uniforms).&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt;

In 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry – polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily"/&gt;

===1975–1986: Tequila sunrise/Orange rainbows===
{{multiple image

}}
The 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt; There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980, though it underwent a few minor modifications with the navy star and number style.&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

===1980–1993: Rainbow shoulders===
Also in 1980, the Astros debuted a significantly cleaner uniform, relegating the rainbows to the sleeves. The design was initially worn on the road (with the original rainbow uniform relegated to home games), but in 1982 the rainbow shoulder look began appearing on select home games as well. In addition, the navy cap returned with this uniform and the orange cap was eventually retired in 1983. By 1987, this uniform became the Astros' primary look, retiring the original rainbow uniforms. The Astros never wore grey uniforms with this design, opting for white at home and cream on the road. Prior to the 1989 season, the pullover design was retired and buttons and belts returned to this uniform.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

===1994–1999: Midnight blue and gold===
Coinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the {{baseball year|1993}} season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The "Astros" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, "flying" star with an open left end.

Both the home and road uniforms featured a star substituting for the penultimate letter "O" in both "Astros" (home) and "Houston" (road); the road uniform was later tweaked in 1997 with the star now affixed next to the word "Houston". The letters were written in a more futuristic manner. The Astros also wore midnight blue alternates with "Astros" in white with gold trim. The midnight blue cap featured the flying star logo. It also marked the first time since 1974 that the Astros wore grey uniforms on the road.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

===2000–2012: Railroad design===
Moving to Minute Maid Park (originally Enron Field) in 2000, the Astros took to the field wearing vintage-inspired uniforms. For the first time, navy was not part of the team's palette, and the Astros uniforms featured brick red, sand and black colors. The colors were inspired by the location of their new ballpark which formerly housed a railroad depot.

Primary home uniforms featured black pinstripes with "Astros" in black script letters and numbers in red. The road uniforms sported "Houston" in red script letters and black numbers. During this period the Astros also experimented with various alternate uniforms, wearing black, red and even non-pinstriped white uniforms. Black caps with the updated star in red became the primary cap while a red cap with the sand star was used as an alternate.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

===2013–present: Return to navy and orange===
In 2013, the Astros returned to the classic navy and orange look of previous eras. Both uniforms featured the city name (road) and team name (home) in block navy letters with orange trim, along with numbers on the left chest. Piping was also added in front. The orange alternate contained the team name and numbers in navy with white trim. The Astros also wore navy uniforms with the orange rainbow stripes along the side; the front originally featured the "H" star before replacing it with "Astros" in orange in 2016. Navy caps with the "H" and orange star returned, along with a road variation featuring an orange brim. Until 2015, the Astros also wore all-orange caps with the home uniforms, and from 2016 to 2018, the navy alternates were paired with an orange cap with navy brim.&lt;ref name="uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HOUdaily" /&gt;

===Astros Hall of Fame===
On January 26, 2019, the team announced plans for a team Hall of Fame along with an inaugural class of inductees (including all retired numbers and members of the 2012 Walk of Fame), complete with an orange jacket and renderings for each of the inductees. The Astros Hall of Fame (with sponsorship by Houston Methodist) is currently located in the former Home Run Alley area of the ballpark under the new name of Hall of Fame Alley., beginning in March, with plaques to be revealed on Hall of Fame weekend on August 2 and induction on August 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kbtx.com/content/sports/Astros-reveal-full-details-of-new-Astros-Hall-of-Fame-504918691.html |title=Astros reveal full details of new Astros Hall of Fame |access-date=2019-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129064146/https://www.kbtx.com/content/sports/Astros-reveal-full-details-of-new-Astros-Hall-of-Fame-504918691.html |archive-date=2019-01-29 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A display was installed in the Union Station lobby on January 31 that included the jerseys and hats of the first class of inductees.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/AstrosTalk/status/1091103749689491456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/astros/history/hall-of-fame|title = Astros Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
{{See also|Houston Astros Radio Network}}
Since 2013, the Astros' flagship radio station is [[KBME (AM)|KBME]], Sportstalk 790 AM (a [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate). Previously, the team had a partnership with [[KTRH (AM)|KTRH]] (740 AM) which went from 1999 to 2012 (both stations are owned by [[iHeartMedia]]). This change suddenly made it difficult for listeners outside of Houston itself to hear the Astros, as KTRH runs 50 kilowatts of power day and night, and KBME runs only five kilowatts. As a result, KTRH is audible across much of Central, East, and South Texas, whereas KBME can only be heard in Houston, especially after dark. [[Milo Hamilton]], a veteran voice who was on the call for [[Hank Aaron]]'s 715th career home run in 1974, retired at the end of the 2012 season, after broadcasting play-by-play for the Astros since 1985. [[Dave Raymond]] and Brett Dolan shared play-by-play duty for road games, while Raymond additionally worked as Hamilton's color analyst (while Hamilton called home games only for the past few seasons before his retirement); they were not retained and instead brought in [[Robert Ford (sportscaster)|Robert Ford]] and [[Steve Sparks (pitcher, born 1965)|Steve Sparks]] to begin broadcasting for the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2013/2/13/3986042/robert-ford-steve-sparks-announced-as-astros-radio-team|title=Astros Announce New Radio Team|first=David|last=Coleman|date=13 February 2013|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324135900/http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2013/2/13/3986042/robert-ford-steve-sparks-announced-as-astros-radio-team|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish language radio play-by-play is handled by Francisco Romero, and his play-by-play partner is [[Alex Treviño]], a former backup catcher for the club.

During the 2012 season Astros games on television were announced by [[Bill Brown (broadcaster)|Bill Brown]] and [[Jim Deshaies]]. In the seven seasons before then, Astros games were broadcast on television by [[Fox Sports Houston]], with select games shown on broadcast TV by [[KTXH]]. As part of a ten-year, $1&amp;nbsp;billion deal with [[Comcast]] that includes a majority stake jointly held by the Astros and the [[Houston Rockets]], Houston Astros games moved to the new Comcast SportsNet Houston at the beginning of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=chron-csnhouston&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast SportsNet Houston plans October launch|url=https://www.chron.com/sports/article/Comcast-SportsNet-Houston-plans-October-launch-3390518.php|work=Houston Chronicle|date=8 March 2012|access-date=13 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126024441/http://www.chron.com/sports/article/Comcast-SportsNet-Houston-plans-October-launch-3390518.php|archive-date=26 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2013 CSN Houston filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] and surprising the Astros who own the largest stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/sportsupdate/2013/09/bankruptcy-petition-filed-on-behalf-of-comcast-sportsnet-houston/|title=CSN Houston bankruptcy filing surprises Astros|date=28 September 2013|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821225917/http://blog.chron.com/sportsupdate/2013/09/bankruptcy-petition-filed-on-behalf-of-comcast-sportsnet-houston/|archive-date=21 August 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being brought out of bankruptcy by [[DirecTV Sports Networks]] and [[AT&amp;T]], the channel's name was changed to Root Sports Southwest then later [[AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest]].

The current television team consists of [[Todd Kalas]] and [[Geoff Blum]].

==Mascots==
{{main|Orbit (mascot)}}
[[File:Orbit Houston Astros mascot preseason 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Orbit (mascot)|Orbit]], Houston Astros mascot from 1990 to 1999, 2013–present]]
Orbit is the name given to MLB's Houston Astros mascot, a lime-green outer-space creature wearing an Astros jersey with antennae extending into baseballs. Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons, where a rabbit named Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field in 2000. (Junction Jack had two "relatives", Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, who were not official mascots). Orbit returned after a 13-year hiatus on November 2, 2012, at the unveiling of the Astros' new look for their 2013 debut in the American League. The name Orbit pays homage to Houston's association with NASA and nickname Space City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/fan_forum/mascot.jsp |title=Houston Astros Mascot – Orbit |website=[[MLB.com]] |access-date=2014-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329231745/http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/fan_forum/mascot.jsp |archive-date=2014-03-29 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1977, the Houston Astros introduced their first mascot, Chester Charge. Created by Ed Henderson, Chester Charge was a Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh-inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, "Charge!" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/6-crazy-mascots-from-texas-past-6395781|title=6 Crazy Mascots From Texas Past|last=Lane|first=Chris|date=2014-08-18|work=Houston Press|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210002158/http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/6-crazy-mascots-from-texas-past-6395781|archive-date=2018-02-10|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
