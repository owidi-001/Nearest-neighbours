'''Ghana''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Ghana.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|ə}}), officially the '''Republic of Ghana''', is a country in [[West Africa]]. It spans the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south, sharing borders with the [[Ivory Coast]] in [[Ghana–Ivory Coast border|the west]], [[Burkina Faso]] in [[Burkina Faso–Ghana border|the north]], and [[Togo]] in [[Ghana–Togo border|the east]].&lt;ref name="warriorking"&gt;Jackson, John G.

With over 31 million people, Ghana is the [[List of African countries by population|second-most populous country]] in West Africa, after [[Nigeria]]. The capital and [[List of cities in Ghana|largest city]] is [[Accra]]; other major cities include Kumasi, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi. 

The first permanent state in present-day Ghana was the [[Bono state]] of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meyerowitz|first=Eva L.

These were unified as an independent [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 6 March 1957, becoming the first colony in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Universal Newsreel"&gt;{{cite video|year=1957|title=Video: A New Nation: Gold Coast becomes Ghana In Ceremony, 1957/03/07 (1957)|url=https://archive.org/details/1957-03-07_A_New_Nation|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|access-date=20 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128113959/http://archive.org/details/1957-03-07_A_New_Nation|archive-date=28 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="First For Sub-Saharan Africa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/14chapter3.shtml|title=First For Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=BBC|access-date=29 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101135716/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/14chapter3.shtml|archive-date=1 November 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exploring Africa – Decolinization"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/images/decolinization.jpg |title=Exploring Africa – Decolonization |publisher=exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu |access-date=29 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602212136/http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/images/decolinization.jpg |archive-date=2 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana subsequently became influential in [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation efforts]] and the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ateku|first=Abdul-Jalilu|title=Ghana is 60: An African success story with tough challenges ahead|url=http://theconversation.com/ghana-is-60-an-african-success-story-with-tough-challenges-ahead-74049|access-date=2021-06-27|website=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known kingdoms to emerge in modern Ghana were the [[Oti–Volta languages|Mole-Dagbani]] states.&lt;ref name=col/&gt; The Mole-Dagomba came on horseback from present-day [[Burkina Faso]] under a single leader, [[Na Gbewa|Naa Gbewaa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.ghananation.com/articles/ghana-history/3017-invasion-of-the-peoples-of-the-north.html|title=Invasion of the Peoples of the North|publisher=GhanaNation|date=15 November 2011|access-date=22 June 2014|first=Jessica|last=W|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708222407/http://articles.ghananation.com/articles/ghana-history/3017-invasion-of-the-peoples-of-the-north.html|archive-date=8 July 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their advanced weapons and based on a central authority, they easily invaded and occupied the lands of the local people ruled by the ''Tendamba'' (land god priests), established themselves as the rulers over the locals, and made [[Gambaga]] their capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.ghananation.com/feed/articles/ghana-articles/3093-dagomba.txt|title=Ghana Articles: Dagomba|publisher=GhanaNation.com|date=19 November 2011|access-date=22 August 2014|author=Curtis M.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019101858/http://articles.ghananation.com/feed/articles/ghana-articles/3093-dagomba.txt|archive-date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Naa Gbewaa caused civil war among his children, some of whom broke off and founded separate states including [[Dagomba people|Dagbon]], [[Mamprusi people|Mamprugu]], [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]], [[Nanumba people|Nanumba]] and [[Wala people|Wala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristoldrumming.com/ghanagoods/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=67|title=Dagomba: Background|publisher=BristolDrumming|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121340/http://www.bristoldrumming.com/ghanagoods/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=67|archive-date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sim.org/index.php/content/mamprusi|title=Mamprusi|publisher=Sim.org|access-date=22 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184651/http://www.sim.org/index.php/content/mamprusi|archive-date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the area of present-day Ghana in [[West Africa]] has experienced many population movements, the [[Akan people|Akan]] speaking peoples began to move into it toward the end of the 15th Century.&lt;ref name="col"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/history/pre-colonial.php|title=Pre-Colonial Period|publisher=Ghanaweb.com|access-date=13 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123235900/http://ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/history/pre-colonial.php|archive-date=23 November 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2013-4%20-%20Pre-European%20Gold%20Mining%20at%20Ashanti,%20Ghana.pdf|title=Pre-European Mining at Ashanti, Ghana|type=PDF|publisher=Pdmhs.com|date=October 1996|access-date=24 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122214748/http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2013-4%20-%20Pre-European%20Gold%20Mining%20at%20Ashanti,%20Ghana.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early sixteenth century, the Akans were firmly established in the Akan state called [[Bonoman]], for which the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]] is named.&lt;ref name=col/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tvedten, Ige|author2=Hersoug, Bjørn|title=Fishing for Development: Small Scale Fisheries in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Itt1hIbsbQsC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1992|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=978-91-7106-327-4|pages=60–|access-date=27 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912143828/https://books.google.com/books?id=Itt1hIbsbQsC&amp;pg=PA60|archive-date=12 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 13th century, Akans emerged from what is believed to have been the Bonoman area, to create several Akan states, mainly based on gold trading.&lt;ref&gt;The Techiman-Bono of Ghana: an ethnography of an Akan society Kendall/Hunt Pub.

In 1947, the newly formed [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC) led by [[The Big Six (Ghana)|"The Big Six"]] called for "self-government within the shortest possible time" following the [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1946]].&lt;ref name="History of Ghana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gocking, Roger|title=The History of Ghana|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofghana00gock|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31894-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofghana00gock/page/92 92]–|access-date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kwame Nkrumah]], a Ghanaian nationalist who led Ghana from 1957 to 1966 as the country's first [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] and [[President of Ghana|President]], formed the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP) in 1949 with the motto "self-government now".&lt;ref name="History of Ghana"/&gt; The party initiated a "positive action" campaign involving non-violent protests, strikes and non-cooperation with the British authorities. Nkrumah was arrested and sentenced to one year imprisonment during this time. In the Gold Coast's [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1951|February 1951 general election]], he was elected to Parliament and released from prison to become leader of government business.&lt;ref name="History of Ghana"/&gt; He became Prime Minister of the Gold Coast in 1952. He improved the infrastructure of the country and his Africanisation policies created better career opportunities for Ghanaians.

On 6 March 1957 at 12&amp;nbsp;midnight, the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], [[Ashanti (Crown Colony)|Ashanti]], the [[Northern Territories of the Gold Coast (British protectorate)|Northern Territories]] and [[British Togoland]] were unified as one single independent dominion within the [[British Commonwealth]] under the name Ghana. This was done under the [[Ghana Independence Act 1957]]. The current [[flag of Ghana]], consisting of the colours red, gold, green, and a black star, dates back to this unification.&lt;ref name="Ghana flag and description"/&gt; It was designed by [[Theodosia Salome Okoh]]; the red represents the blood that was shed towards independence, the gold represents the [[industrial mineral]]s wealth of Ghana, the green symbolises the rich [[grassland]]s of Ghana, and the black star is the symbol of the Ghanaian people and African emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/republic/flag.php|title=Ghana Flag|publisher=Ghanaweb.com|access-date=26 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922181215/http://ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/republic/flag.php|archive-date=22 September 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 1960, following the [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1960|Ghanaian constitutional referendum]] and [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1960|Ghanaian presidential election]], Nkrumah declared Ghana as a republic and assumed the presidency.&lt;ref name="Universal Newsreel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="First For Sub-Saharan Africa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Exploring Africa – Decolinization"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Ghana"/&gt; 6 March is the nation's [[Independence Day (Ghana)|Independence Day]] and 1 July is now celebrated as [[Republic Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.africa.com/5-things-know-ghana-independence-day/|title=5 Things To Know About Ghana's Independence Day|website=Africa.com|access-date=10 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710225301/https://www.africa.com/5-things-know-ghana-independence-day/|archive-date=10 July 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/What-is-Republic-Day-in-Ghana-615882 |title=What is Republic Day in Ghana? |last=Oquaye |first=Mike |date=10 January 2018 |website=GhanaWeb |language=en |access-date=29 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629211559/https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/What-is-Republic-Day-in-Ghana-615882 |archive-date=29 June 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of independence Nkrumah declared, "My first objective is to abolish from [[Ghana]] poverty, ignorance, and disease. We shall measure our progress by the improvement in the health of our people; by the number of children in school, and by the quality of their education; by the availability of water and electricity in our towns and villages; and by the happiness which our people take in being able to manage their own affairs. The welfare of our people is our chief pride, and it is by this that the 5 will ask to be judged.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghana: Problems and Progress |url=https://leonardkenworthy.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1959-ghana-problems-and-progress.pdf |access-date=27 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428094412/https://leonardkenworthy.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1959-ghana-problems-and-progress.pdf |archive-date=28 April 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkrumah was the first African head of state to promote the concept of [[Pan-Africanism]], which he had been introduced to during his studies at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], Pennsylvania in the United States, at the time when [[Marcus Garvey]] was becoming famous for his "Back to Africa Movement".&lt;ref name="History of Ghana"/&gt; Nkrumah merged the teachings of Garvey, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the naturalised [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaian]] scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] into the formation of 1960s Ghana.&lt;ref name="History of Ghana"/&gt;

Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, as he became known, played an instrumental part in the founding of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in establishing the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]] to teach his ideologies of [[communism]] and [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Of Nkrumah's Political Ideologies: Communism, Socialism, Nkrumaism|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=110817|publisher=Ghana Web|date=20 September 2006|access-date=9 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725015602/http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=110817|archive-date=25 July 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; His life achievements were recognised by Ghanaians during his centenary birthday celebration, and the day was instituted as a [[Public holidays in Ghana|public holiday in Ghana]] ([[Founder's Day (Ghana)|Founder's Day]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When it was made a Holiday|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/419363/1/founders-day-to-be-placed-on-ghanas-holiday-calend.html|publisher=Modern Ghana|date=22 September 2012|access-date=9 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925093111/http://www.modernghana.com/news/419363/1/founders-day-to-be-placed-on-ghanas-holiday-calend.html|archive-date=25 September 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Nkrumah was subsequently overthrown by a coup by the [[Ghana Armed Forces]] codenamed "Operation Cold Chop".

[[File:Drugtrade.png|thumb|Ghana is among the sovereign states of West Africa used by [[drug cartel]]s and drug traffickers (shown in orange).]]

There is not a wide or popular knowledge about the narcotics industry and intercepted narcotics within Ghana itself, due to the industry's operations and involvement in the [[black market|underground economy]].  The social context within which [[narcotic trafficking]], storage, transportation, and repacking systems exist in Ghana and the state's location along the [[Gulf of Guinea]] within the Atlantic Ocean{{spaced ndash}}only a few degrees north of the [[Equator]]{{spaced ndash}}makes Ghana an attractive country for the narcotics business.&lt;ref name="Ghana hit by illegal drug trade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulfnews.com/news/world/other-world/ghana-hit-by-illegal-drug-trade-1.1236396 |title=Ghana hit by illegal drug trade |work=[[Gulf News]] |date=28 September 2013 |access-date=4 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212171614/http://gulfnews.com/news/world/other-world/ghana-hit-by-illegal-drug-trade-1.1236396 |archive-date=12 December 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghana could be taken over by drug barons if"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2013/November-20th/ghana-could-be-taken-over-by-drug-barons-ifkwesi-aning.php|title=Ghana could be taken over by drug barons if|publisher=myjoyonline.com|date=20 November 2013|access-date=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210062520/http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2013/November-20th/ghana-could-be-taken-over-by-drug-barons-ifkwesi-aning.php|archive-date=10 December 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic transparency===
According to Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index of 2018, out of 180 countries, Ghana was ranked 78th, with a score of 41 on a scale where a 0–9 score means highly corrupt, and a 90–100 score means very clean. This was based on perceived levels of public sector corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OUR WORK IN Ghana |url=https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/ghana |website=Transparency.org |publisher=Transparency International |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, out of 177 countries, Ghana was ranked 63rd with [[Cuba]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] with a score of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2013|url=https://issuu.com/transparencyinternational/docs/cpi2013_brochure_single_pages?e=2496456/5813913|publisher=Transparency International|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202175813/http://issuu.com/transparencyinternational/docs/cpi2013_brochure_single_pages?e=2496456%2F5813913|archive-date=2 February 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously in 2012, the country ranked 64 and scored 45. Thus, Ghana's public sector scored lower in 2013 than in 2012, according to CPI's scores.

Local reports have claimed that Ghana loses US$4.5&amp;nbsp;billion annually from [[Nominal GDP|nominal gross domestic product]] (Nominal GDP) growth as a result of economic corruption and economic crime by the incumbent [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] (NDC) [[government of Ghana]] led by [[John Dramani Mahama]].&lt;ref name="Ghana Loses $4b Annually To Corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessguideghana.com/?p=4781|title=Ghana Loses $4b Annually To Corruption|publisher=businessguideghana.com|access-date=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131204022555/http://www.businessguideghana.com/?p=4781|archive-date=4 December 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said Ghana has lost an additional US$2.5&amp;nbsp;billion from [[Nominal GDP|nominal gross domestic product]] (Nominal GDP) growth between the months of January 2013 to October 2013 through economic corrupt practices under the [[List of Mahama government ministers|Mahama administration]].&lt;ref name="Impeach Mahama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibeghana.com/2013/10/30/impeach-mahama-over-gyeeda-subah-scandals-group/|title=Impeach Mahama over GYEEDA, SUBAH scandals – Group|publisher=vibeghana.com|date=30 October 2013|access-date=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212051105/http://vibeghana.com/2013/10/30/impeach-mahama-over-gyeeda-subah-scandals-group/|archive-date=12 December 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CanSat was deployed {{convert|200|m|abbr=off}} high from a helium-filled balloon and took some aerial images as well as temperature readings. As its next step in advancing space science and satellite technology in the sub-region, an amateur ground station has been designed and built by the university. It has successfully tracked and communicated with several (amateur) radio satellites in orbit including the [[International Space Station]], receiving [[slow-scan TV]] images on 18 and 20 December 2014. The miniaturized earth observational satellite is to be launched into orbit in 2017.&lt;ref name="VOASpace"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/1686704.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628032244/http://www.voanews.com/a/1686704.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2013|title=Ghana's Home-Grown Space Program Takes Off|year=2013|publisher=Voice of America|access-date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana's annual space exploration expenditure has been 1% of its gross domestic product (GDP), to support research in science and technology. In 2012, Ghana was elected to chair the [[Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South]] (Comsats); Ghana has a joint effort in [[space exploration]] with South Africa's [[South African National Space Agency]] (SANSA).&lt;ref name=BBCSpace/&gt;

Ghana's intention to become the information technology hub of West Africa has led the government of Ghana to enact cyber crime legislation and enhance [[cyber security]] practices.&lt;ref name="The Cyber Index – International Security Trends and Realities"/&gt; Acting on that goal, in 2008 Ghana passed the ''Electronic Communications Act'' and the ''Electronic Transactions Act'', which established the legal framework for governing information technology.&lt;ref name="The Cyber Index – International Security Trends and Realities"/&gt; In November 2011, the Deputy [[Minister for Communications (Ghana)|Minister for Communications]] and Technology announced the development of a national cyber security strategy, aimed at combating [[cyber crime]] and securing critical infrastructure.&lt;ref name="The Cyber Index – International Security Trends and Realities"/&gt;

In June 2012, the [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA) announced a national [[computer emergency response team]] "strategy" designed to co-ordinate government response to cyber-attacks, both internal and external.&lt;ref name="The Cyber Index – International Security Trends and Realities"/&gt; The agency also established [[computer emergency response team]]s for each [[Districts of Ghana|municipal, metropolitan, and district assembly]] to improve co-ordination and information-sharing on [[Threat (computer)|cyberspace threats]].&lt;ref name="The Cyber Index – International Security Trends and Realities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyber-index-2013-en-463.pdf|title=The Cyber Index – International Security Trends and Realities|publisher=unidir.org|pages=63–64|year=2013|access-date=22 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610215601/http://www.unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyber-index-2013-en-463.pdf|archive-date=10 June 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana is ranked 2nd in Africa and 7th globally in [[cyber warfare]], [[cyberterrorism|cyber-terrorism]], [[cyber crime]], and [[internet crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Cyber-crime-Ghana-2nd-in-Africa-7th-in-the-world-281095 |title=Cyber crime:Ghana 2nd in Africa, 7th in the world |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1 August 2013 |website=GhanaWeb |access-date=13 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131200639/https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Cyber-crime-Ghana-2nd-in-Africa-7th-in-the-world-281095 |archive-date=31 January 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was founded.

The Minister for Communications, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, indicated that, "a successful economy is hinged on a secured, safe and resilient national digital ecosystem. Cyber-security is, therefore, very critical to the economic development of the country and essential to the protection of the rights of individuals within the national digital ecosystem".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cybersecurity Act Passed to Promote &amp; Regulate Cybersecurity Activities {{!}} Ministry of Communications|url=https://www.moc.gov.gh/cybersecurity-act-passed-promote-regulate-cybersecurity-activities|access-date=2021-06-24|website=www.moc.gov.gh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and biotechnology===
The [[Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine]] is an agency of the [[Ministry of Health (Ghana)|Ministry of Health]] that was set up in the 1970s for both [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] and as a practical resource (product production &amp; distribution/provision) primarily in areas of [[biotechnology]] related to [[medicinal plants]]. This includes both [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] and work on more advanced applications. It also has a secondary role as an educational resource for foreign students in health, biotechnology and related fields.

{{Main|Education in Ghana}}

===Overview===
Ghanaian education system is divided in three parts: Basic Education, secondary cycle, and tertiary education. "Basic Education" lasts 11 years (ages 4‒15).&lt;ref name="GEScurr"/&gt; It is divided into [[Kindergarten]] (2 years), Primary School (2 modules of 3 years) and Junior High (3 years). Junior High School (JHS) ends with the Basic Education Certificate Examination ([[BECE]]).&lt;ref name="GEScurr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content/basic-education-curriculum-1|title=Basic Education Curriculum|publisher=Ghana Education Service|access-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195225/http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content%2Fbasic-education-curriculum-1|archive-date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEScurr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content/basic-education-curriculum|title=Basic curriculum Education: The junior High Education|publisher=Ghana Education Service|access-date=6 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605133413/http://ges.gov.gh/?q=content%2Fbasic-education-curriculum|archive-date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the BECE is achieved, the pupil can proceed to the secondary cycle.&lt;ref name="BECE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx|title=BECE|access-date=6 June 2014|author=West African Examinations Council(corporate site: Ghana)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519130523/http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx|archive-date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the pupil has the choice between general education (offered by the Senior High School) and vocational education (offered by the technical Senior High School or the Technical and Vocational Institutes).

Due to Ghana being surrounded by [[French-speaking countries]], French is widely taught in schools and universities, as well as a language used for commercial and international economic exchanges and is spoken in some regions.

[[Ghanaian cuisine]] and [[gastronomy]] is diverse, and includes an assortment of [[soup]]s and [[stew]]s with varied seafoods and most Ghanaian soups are prepared with vegetables, meat, poultry or fish.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian cuisine, banku, okra and soup"/&gt; Fish is important in the Ghanaian [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] with [[tilapia]], roasted and fried [[whitebait]], [[smoked fish]] and [[crayfish]] all being common components of Ghanaian dishes.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian cuisine, banku, okra and soup"/&gt;

===Literature===
The Ghanaian national literature radio programme and accompanying publication ''[[Voices of Ghana]]'' was one of the earliest on the African continent. The most prominent Ghanaian authors are novelists; [[J. E. Casely Hayford]], [[Ayi Kwei Armah]] and [[Nii Ayikwei Parkes]], who gained international acclaim with the books, ''[[Ethiopia Unbound]]'' (1911), ''[[The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born]]'' (1968) and ''Tail of the Blue Bird'' (2009), respectively.&lt;ref name="LIT"&gt;{{cite web |work= Amadeus |url= http://www.amadeus.net/home/destinations/es/guides/gh/cul.htm |title= Ghana |language= es |access-date= 1 August 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150223225901/https://www.amadeus.net/home/destinations/es/guides/gh/cul.htm |archive-date= 23 February 2015 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to novels, other literature arts such as Ghanaian theatre and poetry have also had a very good development and support at the national level with prominent Ghanaian playwrights and poets [[Joe de Graft]] and [[Efua Sutherland]].&lt;ref name="LIT"/&gt;
Much of the 2016 novel ''[[Homegoing (Gyasi novel)|Homegoing]]'' by Ghanaian-born American writer [[Yaa Gyasi]] takes place in Ghana.

===Adinkra===
{{Main|Adinkra symbols}}
[[File:Adinkra motifs Rattray 1927.jpg|thumb|[[Adinkra symbols]] by [[Robert Sutherland Rattray]]]]

During the 13th century, Ghanaians developed their unique art of ''[[Adinkra symbols|adinkra]]'' printing. Hand-printed and hand-[[Embroidery|embroidered]] adinkra clothes were made and used exclusively by the then Ghanaian royalty for devotional ceremonies. Each of the [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] that make up the [[Text corpus|corpus]] of adinkra symbolism has a name and meaning derived from a proverb, a historical event, human attitude, [[ethology]], [[plant life-form]], or [[shape]]s of [[inanimate]] and man-made objects. These are graphically rendered in stylised geometric shapes. The meanings of the motifs may be categorised into [[aesthetics]], ethics, [[Interpersonal relationship|human relations]], and concepts.&lt;ref name="LIT"/&gt;

The Adinkra symbols have a decorative function as tattoos but also represent objects that encapsulate evocative messages that convey traditional wisdom, aspects of life or the environment. There are many different symbols with distinct meanings, often linked with [[proverb]]s. In the words of [[Anthony Appiah]], they were one of the means in a pre-literate society for "supporting the transmission of a complex and nuanced body of practice and belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appiah|first=Kwame Anthony|title=In my father's house : Africa in the philosophy of culture|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506852-8|edition=1.paperbackedition 1993.|author-link=Anthony Appiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional clothing===
{{Main|Kente cloth}}
[[File:Kent wove.jpg|thumb|Kente cloth, the traditional or national cloth of Ghana, is worn by most southern Ghanaian ethnic groups including the [[Akan people|Akan]], the [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga]], and the [[Ewe people|Ewe]].]]
Along with the ''Adinkra cloth'' Ghanaians use many different cloth fabrics for their traditional attire.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; The different ethnic groups have their own individual cloth. The most well known is the [[Kente]] cloth.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; Kente is a very important Ghanaian [[national costume]] and clothing and these cloths are used to make traditional and modern Ghanaian Kente [[attire]].&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentecloth.net/ghanaian-kente-cloth/ |title=Ghanaian Kente Cloth |publisher=kentecloth.net |access-date=6 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607002652/http://www.kentecloth.net/ghanaian-kente-cloth/ |archive-date=7 June 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different symbols and different colours mean different things.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; [[Kente cloth|Kente]] is the most famous of all the Ghanaian cloths.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; Kente is a ceremonial cloth hand-woven on a horizontal [[Loom|treadle loom]] and strips measuring about 4&amp;nbsp;inches wide are sewn together into larger pieces of cloths.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; Cloths come in various colours, sizes and designs and are worn during very important social and religious occasions.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt;

In a cultural context, kente is more important than just a cloth and it is a visual representation of history and also a form of written language through weaving.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; The term kente has its roots in the Akan word ''kɛntɛn'' which means a basket and the first kente weavers used raffia fibres to weave cloths that looked like kenten (a basket); and thus were referred to as ''kenten ntoma''; meaning basket cloth.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt; The original Akan name of the cloth was ''nsaduaso'' or ''nwontoma'', meaning "a cloth hand-woven on a loom"; however, "kente" is the most frequently used term today.&lt;ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/&gt;

Contemporary Ghanaian fashion includes traditional and modern styles and fabrics and has made its way into the African and global fashion scene. The cloth known as [[African waxprints|African print fabric]] was created out of Dutch wax textiles. It is believed that in the late 1800s, Dutch ships on their way to Asia stocked with machine-made textiles that mimicked Indonesian Batik stopped at many West African ports on the way. The fabrics did not do well in Asia. However, in West Africa – mainly Ghana where there was an already established market for cloths and textiles – the client base grew and it was changed to include local and traditional designs, colours and patterns to cater to the taste of the new consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrendesign.com/the-story-behind-african-wax-print-cloth/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925182125/http://thewrendesign.com/the-story-behind-african-wax-print-cloth/|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 September 2010|title=The Story Behind African Wax Print Cloth|publisher=Thewrendesign.com|date=10 July 2008|access-date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today outside of Africa it is called "Ankara" and it has a client base well beyond Ghana and Africa as a whole. It is very popular among Caribbean peoples and African Americans; celebrities such as [[Solange Knowles]] and her sister [[Beyoncé]] have been seen wearing African print attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionmagazine.com/scene/red-carpet-society/2013/04/05/beyonce-vs-solange-prints//|first=Erin|last=Wilson|title=Beyonce vs. Solange: Which Sister Wears Bold Prints Best|work=Fashionmagazine.com|date=5 April 2013|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216230934/http://www.fashionmagazine.com/scene/red-carpet-society/2013/04/05/beyonce-vs-solange-prints/|archive-date=16 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers from countries in North America and Europe are now using African prints and it has gained a global interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munaluchibridal.com/african-inspired-spring-2012-collections-takes-over-lfw-nyfw/|title=African-Inspired Spring 2012 Collections Takes Over LFW &amp; NYFW|author=ChiomaChinweoke|publisher=munaluchibridal.com|date=21 September 2011|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216214432/http://munaluchibridal.com/african-inspired-spring-2012-collections-takes-over-lfw-nyfw/|archive-date=16 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; British luxury fashion house [[Burberry]] created a collection around Ghanaian styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/african-style-finds-global-following-but-little-support-from-african-leaders/|title=African Style Goes Global, Despite Little Tangible Support From African Leaders|first=Frankie|last=Edozien|work=The New York Times|date=26 May 2012|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910140503/http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/african-style-finds-global-following-but-little-support-from-african-leaders/|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; American musician [[Gwen Stefani]] has repeatedly incorporated African prints into her clothing line and can often be seen wearing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okayafrica.com/news/design-gwen-stefanis-l-a-m-b-spring-2011-collection/ |title=Design: Gwen Stefani's L.A.M.B Spring 2011 Collection |publisher=Okayafrica.com |date=3 August 2011 |access-date=24 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216220100/http://www.okayafrica.com/news/design-gwen-stefanis-l-a-m-b-spring-2011-collection/ |archive-date=16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally acclaimed Ghanaian-British designer [[Ozwald Boateng]] introduced African print suits in his 2012 collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanprintinfashion.com/2012/09/african-icons-show-at-nyfw-ozwald.html|title=African Icons Show at NYFW: Ozwald Boateng|publisher=Africanprintinfashion.com|date=10 September 2012|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216215105/http://www.africanprintinfashion.com/2012/09/african-icons-show-at-nyfw-ozwald.html|archive-date=16 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana has a budding and thriving film industry. Ghana's film industry dates as far back as 1948 when the Gold Coast Film Unit was set up in the Information Services Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold Coast Film Unit|url=http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/production-company/gold-coast-film-unit|publisher=Colonialfilm.org.uk|access-date=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117123221/http://colonialfilm.org.uk/production-company/gold-coast-film-unit|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some internationally recognised films have come from Ghana. In 1970, ''I Told You So'' was one of the first Ghanaian films to receive international acknowledgement and received great reviews from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|65873|I Told You So}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the 1973 Ghanaian and Italian production ''The African Deal'' also known as "''Contratto carnale''" featuring [[Bahamian American]] actor [[Calvin Lockhart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Deal (1973)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069917/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226173418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069917/|archive-date=26 February 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1983's ''Kukurantumi: the Road to Accra'', a Ghanaian and German production directed by King Ampaw, was written about by famous American film critic [[Vincent Canby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kukurantumi The Road To Accra (1983)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804EFDE1F39F932A35757C0A962948260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 April 1984|access-date=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410144701/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804EFDE1F39F932A35757C0A962948260|archive-date=10 April 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, ''[[Cobra Verde]]'', another Ghanaian and German production directed by [[Werner Herzog]], received international acclamation and in 1988, ''Heritage Africa'' won more than 12 film awards.

In recent times there have been collaborations between Ghanaian and Nigerian crew and cast and a number of productions turned out. Many Ghanaian films are co-produced with [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nollywood]], the Nigerian film industry, and some are distributed by Nigerian marketers. Also, Nigerian filmmakers often feature Ghanaian actors and actresses in their movies and Ghanaian filmmakers feature Nigerian actors and actresses in theirs. [[Nadia Buari]], [[Yvonne Nelson]], [[Lydia Forson]] and [[Jackie Appiah]] all popular Ghanaian actresses and [[Van Vicker]] and [[Majid Michel]] both popular Ghanaian actors, have starred in many Nigerian movies. As a result of these collaborations, Western viewers often confuse Ghanaian movies with Nollywood and count their sales as one; however, they are two independent industries that sometimes share ''Nollywood''. In 2009, [[Unesco]] described Nollywood as the second-biggest film industry in the world after [[Bollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7086248.ece |title=Nollywood success puts Nigeria's film industry in regional spotlight |work=The Times|first=Jonathan|last=Clayton|date=3 April 2010|access-date=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though The Ghana Film Industry had a downtrend for almost a decade mainly because of low input in production this scenario has drastically change. New and emerging young film makers are adding spice to the already rich Ghana movie scene. Bliz Bazawule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Burial of Kojo(2018)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7497366/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Sedufia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aloe Vera(2020)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12027832/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Clef&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Till Sunset(2019) |url=https://filmfreeway.com/JosephClefAboah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others have shown the world the new age of filming in Ghana.

The [[media of Ghana]] are amongst the most free in Africa. Chapter 12 of the 1992 [[Constitution of Ghana]] guarantees [[freedom of the press]] and independence of the media, while Chapter 2 prohibits censorship.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghana.gov.gh/ghana/constitution_republic_ghana.jsp |title=Constitution of Ghana |access-date=18 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324233340/http://ghana.gov.gh/ghana/constitution_republic_ghana.jsp |archive-date=24 March 2008 }}, ''Government of Ghana''.&lt;/ref&gt; Post-independence, the government and media often had a tense relationship, with private outlets closed during the military governments and strict media laws that prevented criticism of government.&lt;ref name="Anokwa"&gt;Anokwa, K.

Press freedoms were restored in 1992, and after the election in 2000 of [[John Kufuor|John Agyekum Kufuor]] the tensions between the private media and government decreased.
