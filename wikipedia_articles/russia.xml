It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|largest country in the world]], covering over {{convert|17|e6km2|e6mi2}}, and encompassing more than one-eighth of Earth's inhabited land area. Russia extends across [[Time in Russia|eleven time zones]], and has the [[List of countries and territories by land borders|most borders of any country]] in the world, with [[borders of Russia|sixteen sovereign nations]].{{efn|Russia shares land borders with fourteen [[sovereign nation]]s, and has [[Maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with the [[United States]] and [[Japan]], and borders the two [[partially recognized states|partially recognized]] breakaway states of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]].}} It has a population of 146.2 million; and is the [[List of European countries by population|most populous country]] in Europe, and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|ninth-most populous country]] in the world. [[Moscow]], the capital, is the [[List of European cities by population|largest city in Europe]], while [[Saint Petersburg]] is the nation's [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|second-largest city]] and cultural centre. [[Russians]] are the largest [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European nation]]; they speak [[Russian language|Russian]], the most spoken [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]], and the most spoken [[native language]] in Europe.

The [[East Slavs]] emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The [[medieval]] state of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] arose in the 9th century. In 988, it adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined [[Russian culture]] for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated until it was finally reunified by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in the 15th century. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and [[Russian explorers|exploration]] to become the [[Russian Empire]], the [[List of largest empires|third-largest empire]] in history. Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] became the largest and leading [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]], which was a [[one-party state]] throughout most of its existence. The Soviet Union played a [[Eastern Front (World War II)|decisive role]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in [[World War II]], and emerged as a [[superpower]] and rival to the United States during the [[Cold War]]. The Soviet era saw some of the [[Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|most significant technological achievements]] of the 20th century, including the world's [[Sputnik|first human-made satellite]] and the launching of the [[Yuri Gagarin|first human in space]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation. In the aftermath of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1993]], a new [[Constitution of Russia|constitution]] was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a [[federation|federal]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic. [[Vladimir Putin]] has dominated Russia's political system [[2000 Russian presidential election|since 2000]], and [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|his government]] has been accused of [[authoritarianism]], numerous [[Human rights in Russia|human rights abuses]], and [[Corruption in Russia|corruption]].

Russia is a [[great power]], and is considered a [[potential superpower]]. It is ranked very high in the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]], with a [[Healthcare in Russia|universal healthcare system]], and a [[Free education|free]] [[Education in Russia|university education]]. Russia's [[Economy of Russia|economy]] is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|eleventh-largest by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|sixth-largest by PPP]]. It is a recognised [[nuclear weapons states|nuclear-weapons state]], possessing the world's [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|largest stockpile of nuclear weapons]], with the world's [[Military#Capability development|second-most powerful military]], and the [[List of countries by military expenditure|fourth-highest military expenditure]]. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the world's largest, and it is one of the leading [[oil producer|producers of oil]] and [[natural gas producer|natural gas]] globally. It is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]], a member of the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[International Investment Bank|IIB]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], as well as the leading member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|CSTO]], and the [[Eurasian Economic Union|EAEU]]. Russia is also home to the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|ninth-greatest number]] of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

{{Main|Rus' people|Rus' (name)}}
{{See also|Russian (disambiguation)}}
The name ''Russia'' is derived from [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], a medieval state populated primarily by the [[East Slavs]].&lt;ref name="Rus"&gt;Excerpted from {{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/2.htm|title=Russia - History|editor=Glenn E. Curtis |year=1998|publisher=Washington, D.C.: Federal Research Division of the [[Library of Congress]]|access-date=29 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proper name became more prominent in later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "Русская земля" (''Russkaya zemlya''), which can be translated as "Russian land".&lt;ref&gt;Kuchkin V. A. Russian land // Ancient Russia in the medieval world / Institute of General History of the Russian Academy of Sciences ; Ed. E. A. Melnikova , V. Ya. Petrukhina . - M .: Ladomir, 2014. - S. 697-698.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as ''[[Kievan Rus']]'' by modern historiography.

An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt;

Following the October Revolution, the [[Russian Civil War]] broke out between the [[anti-Communist]] [[White movement]] and the new [[Workers' council|Soviet]] regime with its [[Red Army]].

According to the [[Constitution of Russia]], the country is an [[asymmetric federalism|asymmetric federation]] and [[semi-presidential]] republic, wherein the president is the [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|website=(Article 80, §&amp;nbsp;1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|access-date=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]]. The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[representative democracy]], with the federal government composed of three branches:&lt;ref name="DeRouenHeo2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karl R.|last1=DeRouen|first2=Uk|last2=Heo|title=Defense and Security: A Compendium of National Armed Forces and Security Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdeBgfmZI0cC&amp;pg=PA666|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-781-4|page=666}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legislative: The [[bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], made up of the 450-member [[State Duma]] and the 170-member [[Federation Council]], adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]] and the power of [[impeachment]] of the president.
* Executive: The [[President of Russia|president]] is the [[Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|commander-in-chief]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], can veto [[legislative bill]]s before they become law, and appoints the [[Government of Russia]] (Cabinet) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary of Russia|Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the president, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term (eligible for a second term, but not for a third consecutive term).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|website=(Article 81, §&amp;nbsp;3)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|access-date=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ministries of the government are composed of the premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma).

The sheer size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountains in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and Pacific oceans, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.
Most of [[Northwest Russia]] and Siberia has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly [[Sakha]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|−71.2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}),&lt;ref name="Arctic"/&gt; and more moderate winters elsewhere.

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the Black Sea, most notably in [[Sochi]], possesses a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt; In many regions of East Siberia and the Russian Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a [[semi-arid climate]].

Throughout much of the territory, there are only two distinct seasons—winter and summer—as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt; The coldest month is January (February on the coastline); the warmest is usually July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=V.

Early Russian painting is represented in [[Russian icons|icons]] and vibrant [[fresco]]s. As Moscow rose to power, [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Dionisius]] and [[Andrei Rublev]] became vital names in Russian art. The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757. In the 18th century, academicians [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]] became influential. The early 19th century saw many prominent paintings by [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]]. In the mid-19th century, the group of mostly [[Realism (arts)|realist]]s ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' broke with the Academy. Leading Russian realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Ilya Repin]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]]. The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]; represented by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Nicholas Roerich]]. The [[Russian avant-garde]] flourished from approximately 1890 to 1930; notable artists from this era were [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Some influential Soviet sculptures include [[Vera Mukhina]], [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]] and [[Ernst Neizvestny]].
[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], an architectural landmark of Saint Petersburg.]]
Beginning with the woodcraft buildings of ancient [[Slavs]]; since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by [[Byzantine architecture]]. [[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of the unique [[tent-like church]]es; and the [[onion dome]] design. In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]]; the country's architecture became influenced by Western Europe. The 18th-century taste for [[Rococo]] architecture led to the splendid works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] was transformed into an outdoor museum of [[Neoclassical architecture]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and [[Russian Revival]] style. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Fyodor Shekhtel]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Moisei Ginzburg]] and [[Victor Vesnin]]), and [[Stalinist architecture|Socialist Classicism]] ([[Boris Iofan]]).
