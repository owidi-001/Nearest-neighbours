'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|ɡ|ən}} {{respell|RAY|gən}}; February 6, 1911{{spnd}}June 5, 2004) was an American politician&lt;!-- NOT "statesman" per [[Talk:Ronald Reagan/Archive 18#RfC about whether Reagan is a statesman in the lead section]] --&gt; who served as the 40th [[president of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern [[conservatism]]. Prior to his presidency, he was a [[Hollywood movie]] actor and [[Trade union|union]] leader before serving as the 33rd [[governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975.

Raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern [[Illinois]], Reagan graduated from [[Eureka College]] in 1932 and worked as a radio sports commentator. After moving to [[California]] in 1937, he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions. As president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], Reagan worked to root out alleged [[Communism|communist]] influence. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at [[General Electric]] factories. In 1964, his speech "[[A Time for Choosing]]" earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, Reagan was elected [[governor of California]] in [[1966 California gubernatorial election|1966]]. As governor, he raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and ordered in [[California National Guard|National Guard troops]] during [[People's Park (Berkeley)|a period of protest movements]].

In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the [[incumbent]] president, [[Jimmy Carter]]. At {{ayd|1911|2|6|1981|1|20}} of age at the time of his [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|first inauguration]], Reagan was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency, a distinction he held until 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] at age {{ayd|1946|6|14|2017|1|20}}. Reagan faced former vice president [[Walter Mondale]] when he ran for re-election in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and defeated him, winning the most [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of any U.S. president, 525, or 97.6% of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. It was the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|second-most lopsided presidential election]] in modern U.S. history after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] victory over [[Alf Landon|Alfred M. Landon]], in which he won 98.5%, or 523, of the (then-total) 531 electoral votes.&lt;ref name="murse1"&gt;{{cite web| title=The Most Lopsided Presidential Elections in U.S. History: How a Landslide is Measured| last=Murse| first=Tom| date=January 28, 2019| url=https://www.thoughtco.com/landslide-presidential-elections-by-electoral-votes-3367489| publisher=ThoughtCo| access-date=March 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after taking office as president, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term, he survived an [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]], spurred the [[War on Drugs]], [[United States invasion of Grenada|invaded Grenada]], and fought public sector labor unions. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4% and an average [[real GDP]] annual growth of 3.6%. Reagan enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending, which contributed to increased federal debt overall. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]], the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Iran–Contra affair]], and the ongoing [[Cold War]]. In June 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]", Reagan challenged Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall!]]", during a speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. He transitioned Cold War policy from [[détente]] to [[rollback]] by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev. The talks culminated in the [[INF Treaty]], which shrank both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan began his presidency during the decline of the Soviet Union, which [[Soviet Union collapse|ultimately collapsed]] nearly three years after he left office.

When Reagan left office in 1989, he held an approval rating of 68%, matching those of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and later [[Bill Clinton]], as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.&lt;ref name="cbsnews1"&gt;{{cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|access-date = May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first president since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve two full terms, after the five prior presidents did not. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier that year. Afterward, his informal public appearances became more infrequent as the disease progressed. He [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died at home]] on June 5, 2004. His tenure constituted a [[Realigning election|realignment]] toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is an icon among conservatives. Evaluations of his presidency among historians and the general public place him [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|among the upper tier of American presidents]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home (8030104930).jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan's boyhood home in [[Dixon, Illinois]]]]

Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in an apartment on the [[Birthplace of Ronald Reagan|second floor of a commercial building]] in [[Tampico, Illinois]]. He was the younger son of [[Nelle Wilson Reagan|Nelle Clyde]] ({{nee|Wilson}}) and [[Jack Reagan]].&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt; Jack was a salesman and storyteller whose grandparents were [[Irish Catholic]] emigrants from [[County Tipperary]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Golway]], ''Ronald Reagan's America'' (2008) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; while Nelle was of English and Scottish descent.&lt;ref name="pk 4"&gt;Kengor, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald's older brother, [[Neil Reagan]], became an advertising executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Neil Reagan, 88, Ad Executive And Jovial Brother of President|author=Lynette Holloway|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/us/neil-reagan-88-ad-executive-and-jovial-brother-of-president.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 1996|access-date=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's father nicknamed his son "Dutch", due to his "fat little Dutchman" appearance and Dutch-boy haircut; the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.&lt;ref name="RRfacts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Ronald Reagan|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sreference/facts-ronald|access-date=March 24, 2019|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois, including [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]], [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]], and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|title=Is Ronald Reagan's Chicago boyhood home doomed?|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=June 12, 2012|last=Janssen|first=Kim|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005705/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|archive-date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, they returned to Tampico and lived above the [[H. C. Pitney Variety Store]] until finally settling in [[Dixon, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=nrhp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/201351.pdf|title= Main Street Historic District, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form|date=April 1, 1982|agency=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|access-date=July 27, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807213939/http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/201351.pdf|archive-date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his election as president, Reagan lived in the upstairs White House private quarters, and he would quip that he was "living above the store" again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/06/06/reagan_all_american_dies_at_93/|title=Reagan, all-American, dies at 93|date=June 6, 2004|author=Schribman, David|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Ronald Reagan wrote that his mother "always expected to find the best in people and often did".&lt;ref name="am 22"&gt;Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Disciples of Christ]] church regularly and was active, and very influential, within it; she frequently led Sunday school services and gave the Bible readings to the congregation during the services. A firm believer in the power of [[prayer]], she led prayer meetings at church and was in charge of mid-week prayers when the pastor was out of town.&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an adherent of the [[Social Gospel]] movement.&lt;ref name=jacobin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/03/reagan-american-journey-review-spitz-biography |title=The Paranoid, Reactionary Dreams of Ronald Reagan |last=Rubin |first=Lyle Jeremy |date=March 16, 2019 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|access-date=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her strong commitment to the church is what induced her son Ronald to become a Protestant Christian rather than a Roman Catholic like his Irish father.&lt;ref name="pk 4"/&gt; He also stated that she strongly influenced his own beliefs: "I know that she planted that faith very deeply in me."&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan identified himself as a born-again Christian.&lt;ref name="Reaganbornagain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/07/25/reagan-carter-anderson-three-born-again-christians-who-differ-on-meaning/55792b50-3e7b-4539-94f8-a861f24f51b7/|title=Reagan, Carter, Anderson: Three 'Born Again' Christians Who Differ on Meaning|date=July 25, 1980|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dixon, Reagan was strongly influenced by his pastor Beh Hill Cleaver, an erudite scholar. Cleaver was the father of Reagan's fiancée. Reagan saw him as a second father. Stephen Vaughn says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At many points the positions taken by the First Christian Church of Reagan's youth coincided with the words, if not the beliefs of the latter-day Reagan. These positions included faith in Providence, association of America's mission with God's will, belief in progress, trust in the work ethic and admiration for those who achieved wealth, an uncomfortableness with literature and art that questioned the family or challenged notions of proper sexual behavior, presumption that poverty is an individual problem best left to charity rather than the state, sensitivity to problems involving alcohol and drugs, and reticence to use government to protect civil rights for minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27551378 |jstor=27551378 |title=The Moral Inheritance of a President: Reagan and the Dixon Disciples of Christ |last1=Vaughn |first1=Stephen |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |year=1995 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=109–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Paul Kengor]], Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people; this faith stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother&lt;ref name="pk 16"&gt;Kengor, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,&lt;ref name="pk 16"/&gt; into which he was baptized in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lewis|editor-first1=Warren|editor-last2=Rollmann|editor-first2=Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59752-416-2|pages=181–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that period, which was long before the [[civil rights movement]], Reagan's opposition to [[racial discrimination]] was unusual. He recalled the time when his college football team was staying at a local hotel which would not allow two black teammates to stay there, and he invited them to his parents' home {{convert|15|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} away in Dixon. His mother invited them to stay overnight and have breakfast the next morning.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Mayer, Reagan and two African-American teammates"&gt;''Deconstructing Reagan: Conservative Mythology and America's Fortieth President'', Kyle Longley, Jeremy D. Mayer, Michael Schaller, John W. Sloan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NHJsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 Ch. 3 "Reagan and Race: Prophet of Color Blindness, Baiter of the Backlash," Jeremy Mayer, page 73], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deroy Murdock, Reagan, No Racist, 2007"&gt;[https://www.nationalreview.com/2007/11/reagan-no-racist-deroy-murdock/ "Reagan, No Racist"], ''National Review'', Deroy Murdock, November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was strongly opposed to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] due to his Catholic heritage, but also due to the Klan's [[Antisemitism in the United States|anti-semitism]] and [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|anti-black racism]].&lt;ref name=jacobin/&gt; After becoming a prominent actor, Reagan gave speeches in favor of [[racial equality]] following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Reagan (Part 1)|series=American Experience|series-link=American Experience|network=[[PBS]]|station=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|date=February 23, 1998|season=10|number=6|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/reagan/|access-date=October 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years at Hollywood, Reagan became a member of the Hollywood-Beverly Christian Church&lt;ref name="Reaganbornagain"/&gt; and attended its services infrequently. Subsequently from 1964 onwards, Reagan began to attend church services at [[Bel Air Church|Bel Air Presbyterian Church]], where he became acquainted with [[Donn Moomaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006), p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan scaled down his church attendance while serving as President, citing the inconvenience that his large Secret Service entourage would bring to other churchgoers and the potential danger (to others) from his presence due to possible terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPD:The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate|url=https://debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/october-7-1984-debate-transcript/|access-date=2021-06-30|website=www.debates.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving office, Reagan officially joined Bel Air as its member and regularly attended services there.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006), p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal education===

==Entertainment career==
{{Further|Ronald Reagan filmography}}

===Radio and film===
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan took jobs in Iowa as a radio announcer at several stations. He moved to [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radio in [[Des Moines]] as an announcer for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball games. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;24–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald Reagan in The Bad Man (1941).png|thumb|''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941)]]

While traveling with the Cubs in California in 1937, Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with [[Warner Bros.]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;35–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the "[[B film]]" unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers "didn't want them good; they wanted them Thursday".&lt;ref name="agpi"/&gt;

He earned his first screen credit with a starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939, he had already appeared in 19 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan &gt; Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|access-date=March 28, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312120428/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|archive-date=March 12, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Dark Victory]]'' with [[Bette Davis]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Before the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' with [[Errol Flynn]] in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper".&lt;ref name="Cannon15"&gt;Cannon &amp; Beschloss (2001), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562|title=Cupid's Influence on the Film Box-office.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1956)]]|location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=October 4, 1941|access-date=April 24, 2012|page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week–end Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan played his favorite acting role in 1942's ''[[Kings Row]]'',&lt;ref name="Rest of Me"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reagan|first=Ronald|title=Where's the Rest of Me?|year=1965|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York|isbn=978-0-283-98771-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he plays a double amputee who recites the line "Where's the rest of me?"—later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics considered ''Kings Row'' to be his best movie,&lt;ref name="TCMarticle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=17922|title=Kings Row|access-date=March 24, 2009|last=Wood|first=Brett|website=TCM website|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the film was condemned by ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 3, 1942|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E2DE143BE33BBC4B53DFB4668389659EDE|title=The Screen; 'Kings Row,' With Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains, a Heavy, Rambling Film, Has Its First Showing Here at the Astor|access-date=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kings Row'' made Reagan a star—Warner immediately tripled his salary to $3,000 a week. Shortly afterwards, he received co-star above-the-title billing with Flynn – who was still a huge star at the time – in ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942). In April 1942, Reagan was ordered to military active duty in San Francisco and never quite became a big first-rank film star despite playing the lead in numerous movies.&lt;ref name="Friedrich"&gt;{{Cite book|last =Friedrich|first =Otto|title =City of nets: a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|publisher=University of California Press (reprint)|year =1997|pages =86–89,105–106|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9uZw7YNK8C |isbn =978-0-520-20949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his wartime military service he co-starred in such films as ''[[The Voice of the Turtle (film)|The Voice of the Turtle]]'', ''[[John Loves Mary]]'', ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', ''[[Cattle Queen of Montana]]'', ''[[Tennessee's Partner]]'', ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]'' (the only film in which he appears with Nancy Reagan), and his one turn at playing a vicious villain, in the 1964 remake ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (his final film) with [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Angie Dickenson]]. Throughout his film career, Reagan's mother answered much of his fan mail.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, et al. (2003), p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
[[File:Reagan FMPU.jpg|thumb|left|Capt. Ronald Reagan at [[First Motion Picture Unit#Life at Fort Roach|Fort Roach]], 1943 or 1944.]]

After completing 14 home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Enlisted Reserve]] and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers' Reserve Corps of the Cavalry on May 25, 1937.&lt;ref name="ACR Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH+Armored+Cavalry+Regiment/11thACR/ |publisher=11th Armored Cavalry Regiment |title=History of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment |access-date=November 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701172746/http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH%2BArmored%2BCavalry%2BRegiment/11thACR/ |archive-date=July 1, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 1942, Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time. Due to his poor eyesight, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas.&lt;ref name="USSRR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reagan.navy.mil/about_reagan.html|title=USS ''Ronald Reagan'': Ronald Reagan|publisher=United States Navy|access-date=March 7, 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071030073032/http://www.reagan.navy.mil/about_reagan.html|archive-date =October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first assignment was at the [[San Francisco Port of Embarkation]] at Fort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office.&lt;ref name="nat usaf"/&gt; Upon the approval of the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the [[First Motion Picture Unit|18th AAF Base Unit]] (Motion Picture Unit) at [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref name="nat usaf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1660|title=President Ronald Reagan|access-date=December 30, 2007|publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222110350/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1660|archive-date=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 1943, he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of ''[[This Is the Army]]'' at [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="nat usaf"/&gt; He returned to the 18th AAF Base Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] on July 22, 1943.&lt;ref name="Reagan in the Military"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/military.html|title=Military service of Ronald Reagan|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|access-date=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1944, Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the [[Series E bond|Sixth War Loan Drive]], which campaigned for the purchase of [[war bond]]s. He was reassigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Reagan in the Military"/&gt; By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the Air Force, including cockpit simulations for B-29 crews scheduled to bomb Japan. He was separated from active duty on December 9, 1945, as an Army captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Rowan|title=World War II Goes to the Movies &amp; Television Guide Volume II L-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytrGBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|page=121|isbn=9781105465437}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in the service, Reagan obtained a film reel depicting the liberation of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]; he held on to it, believing that doubts would someday arise as to whether [[the Holocaust]] had occurred.&lt;ref name="cannon486-90"&gt;Cannon (1991, 2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;486–490.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screen Actors Guild presidency===
[[File:Dick Powell Show Premiere Episode 1961.JPG|thumb|Guest stars for the premiere of ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]'', 1961. Reagan can be seen wearing a [[ten-gallon hat]] on the far left.]]

Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) in 1941, serving as an alternate member. After World War II, he resumed service and became third vice president in 1946.&lt;ref name="SAG"&gt;{{cite web| title=Ronald Reagan| url=https://www.sagaftra.org/ronald-reagan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404080752/https://www.sagaftra.org/ronald-reagan| archive-date=April 4, 2020| website=SAG-AFTRA| access-date=April 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the SAG president and six board members resigned in March 1947 due to the union's new bylaws on [[conflict of interest]], Reagan was elected president in a special election. He was subsequently re-elected six times, in 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1959. He led the SAG through implementing the 1947 [[Taft–Hartley Act]], various labor-management disputes, and the [[Hollywood blacklist]] era.&lt;ref name="SAG"/&gt; First instituted in 1947 by Studio executives who agreed that they would not employ anyone believed to be or to have been [[Communism|Communists]] or sympathetic with [[political radicalism|radical politics]], the blacklist grew steadily larger during the early 1950s as the U.S. Congress continued to investigate domestic political [[subversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=&lt;!--history.com editors; no by-line.--&gt;| title=Hollywood Ten| url=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/hollywood-ten| website=history.com| date=September 12, 2018| orig-year=Originally published December 16, 2009| publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks| access-date=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during his tenure, Reagan was instrumental in securing [[Residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] for television actors when their episodes were re-run, and later, for motion picture actors when their studio films aired on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=What Reagan Did for Hollywood| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/what-reagan-did-for-hollywood/248391/| last=Federman| first=Wayne| date=November 14, 2011| work=The Atlantic| access-date=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FBI informant===
In 1946, Reagan served on the national board of directors for the [[Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions]] (ICCASP) and had been a member of its Hollywood chapter (HICCASP). His attendance at a July 10, 1946, meeting of HICCASP brought him to the attention of the [[FBI]], which interviewed him on April 10, 1947, in connection with its investigation into HICCASP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John P.| last=Diggines| title=Ronald Reagan: Fate, Freedom, and the Making of History| publisher=W.

Even so, he was uncomfortable with the way the SAG was being used by the government, asking during one FBI interview, "Do they (ie. the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]) expect us to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and determine just who is a Commie and who isn't?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine| title=Unmasking Informant T-10| date=September 9, 1985| volume=126| issue=10| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959749,00.html| magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| access-date=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Reagan Played Informant Role For FBI In '40s| last=Herhold| first=Scott| date=August 26, 1985| url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-08-26-8502250710-story.html| work=Chicago Tribune| access-date=October 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HUAC's Hollywood hearings===
In October 1947 during HUAC's Hollywood hearings, Reagan testified as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]:&lt;ref name=HollywoodHearings&gt;
{{cite book 
 | title = Hearings regarding the communist infiltration of the motion picture industry. Hearings before the Committee on Un-American Activities 
 | publisher = US GPO
 | url = https://archive.org/details/hearingsregardin1947aunit/mode/2up 
 | pages = 32 ("Regan"), 97 ("Regan"), 213–219 (testimony)
 | date = 1947 
 | access-date=April 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been a small group within the Screen Actors Guild which has consistently opposed the policy of the guild board and officers of the guild... suspected of more or less following the tactics that we associate with the Communist Party... At times they have attempted to be a disruptive influence... I have heard different discussions and some of them tagged as Communists... I found myself misled into being a sponsor on another occasion for a function that was held under the auspices of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]].&lt;ref name=HollywoodHearings/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding a "jurisdictional strike" going on for seven months at that time, Reagan testified:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first time that this word "Communist" was ever injected into any of the meetings concerning the strike was at a meeting in Chicago with Mr. William Hutchinson, president of the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners]], who were on strike at the time. He asked the Screen Actors Guild to submit terms to Mr. Walsh, for Walsh to give in the settling of this strike, and he told us to tell Mr. Walsh that if he would give in on these terms he in turn would run this Sorrell and the other Commies out—I am quoting him—and break it up.&lt;ref name=HollywoodHearings/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  However, Reagan also opposed measures soon to manifest in the [[Mundt–Nixon Bill]] in May 1948 by opining:&lt;blockquote&gt; As a citizen I would hesitate, or not like, to see any political party outlawed on the basis of its political ideology... I detest, I abhor their philosophy, but I detest more than that their tactics, which are those of the fifth column, and are dishonest, but at the same time I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment.&lt;ref name=HollywoodHearings/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further, when asked whether he was aware of Communist efforts within the [[Screen Writers Guild]], Reagan would not play along, saying, "Sir, like the other gentlemen, I must say that that is hearsay."&lt;ref name=HollywoodHearings/&gt;

===Television===
Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and moved into television.&lt;ref name="agpi"&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Actor, Governor, President, Icon|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18329-2004Jun5.html|date=June 6, 2004|access-date=January 26, 2008|author=Cannon, Lou|page=A01|author-link=Lou Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hired as the host of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeSmNaKCjaw|title=GE Theater Introduction|last=GE Reports|date=June 15, 2011|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.&lt;ref name="agpi"/&gt; His contract required him to tour [[General Electric]] (GE) plants 16 weeks out of the year, which often demanded that he give 14 talks per day.&lt;ref name="agpi"/&gt; He earned approximately $125,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.125|1962|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in this role.

==Early political career==
[[File:Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California 1964.jpg|thumb|[[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] and Ronald Reagan aboard a boat in California, 1964]]

Reagan began as a Hollywood [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was "a true hero" to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward M. Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=12–15|isbn=9780742544215}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] in the 1950s, became a Republican in 1962, and emerged as a leading conservative spokesman in the [[Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign|Goldwater campaign of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;Lori Clune, "Political Ideology and Activism to 1966" in Andrew L. Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;22–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early political career, he joined numerous political committees with a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] orientation, such as the [[American Veterans Committee (1943–2008)|American Veterans Committee]]. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and supported [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]] in 1950 when she [[1950 United States Senate election in California|was defeated for the Senate]] by [[Richard Nixon]]. It was his belief that [[Communism|Communists]] were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Woodard|title=Ronald Reagan: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6zL1eWMwLsC&amp;pg=PA28 |year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=28|isbn=9780313396397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At rallies, Reagan frequently spoke with a strong ideological dimension. In December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the [[Warner Bros.]] studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency when he specifically stated his opposition to [[mutual assured destruction]]. Reagan also built on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/president-reagans-legacy-and-us-nuclear-weapons-policy |title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy |publisher=Heritage.org |date=July 20, 2006 |access-date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]], Reagan strongly supported [[Harry S. Truman]] and appeared on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=McCullough&gt;[[David McCullough|McCullough, David]]. ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, p. 665. {{ISBN|0-671-45654-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew,&lt;ref name="An American Life"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reagan |first=Ronald |year=1990 |title=An American Life: The Autobiography |url=https://archive.org/details/americanlife00reag |url-access=registration |location=New York City |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=978-0-671-69198-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he shifted to the right when he endorsed the presidential candidacies of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1952 and 1956) and Richard Nixon (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton (1998) pp.&amp;nbsp;29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan was hired by [[General Electric]] (GE) in 1954 to host the ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', a weekly TV drama series. He also traveled across the country to give motivational speeches to over 200,000 GE employees. His many speeches—which he wrote himself—were [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by [[Lemuel Boulware]], a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: [[free markets]], [[anti-communism|anticommunism]], lower taxes, and [[limited government]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Evans, ''The Education of Ronald Reagan: The General Electric Years and the Untold Story of His Conversion to Conservatism'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally registered as a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He often said, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me."&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the legislation that would become [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, "we will awake to find that we have [[socialism]]. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=AYrlDlrLDSQ|title=Ronald Reagan speaks out on Socialized Medicine&amp;nbsp;– Audio|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rapaport, June 21, 2009, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/18/INME187IB0.DTL How AMA 'Coffeecup' gave Reagan a boost]. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Democratic initiatives he opposed in the 1960s included the [[Food Stamp Program]], raising the minimum wage, and the establishment of the [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref name=jacobin/&gt; He also joined the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) and would become a lifetime member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral Controversies in American Politics|first1=Raymond|last1=Tatalovich|author2=Byron W.

Reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;1–6&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He consolidated themes that he had developed in his talks for GE to deliver his famous speech, "[[A Time for Choosing]]":

{{quote|The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing&amp;nbsp;... You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down.

This "A Time for Choosing" speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign, but it was the crucial event that established Reagan's national political visibility. [[David Broder]] of ''The Washington Post'' called it, "the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic convention with his Cross of Gold speech".&lt;ref&gt;Broder quoted in J. David Woodard, ''Ronald Reagan: A Biography'' (Greenwood, 2012) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reid Gold, "Ronald Reagan and the oral tradition."

Shortly after assuming office, Reagan tested the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential waters]] as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's southern support&lt;ref name="Stormy"&gt;*{{cite book|author=Fischer, Klaus|title=America in White, Black, and Gray: The Stormy 1960s|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1816-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCXig_6abwkC&amp;pg=PA241 |pages=241–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become a compromise candidate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|title=The New Rules of Play|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 8, 1968|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114005733/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|access-date=October 16, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; if neither Nixon nor second-place candidate [[Nelson Rockefeller]] received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at [[1968 Republican National Convention|the Republican convention]]. However, by the time of the convention, Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.&lt;ref name="Stormy"/&gt;

Reagan was involved in several high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era, including his public criticism of university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations at the Berkeley campus. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#May 15, 1969: "Bloody Thursday"|People's Park protests]] at the university's campus (the original purpose of which was to discuss the [[Arab–Israeli conflict#1967–73|Arab–Israeli conflict]]), Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests. This led to an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday", resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.&lt;ref name="Cannon50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208133535/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 8, 2009|access-date=December 9, 2007|date=February 16, 1970|title=Postscript to People's Park|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 111 police officers were injured in the conflict, including one who was knifed in the chest. Reagan then called out 2,200 [[California National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.&lt;ref name="Cannon50"&gt;Cannon &amp; Beschloss (2001), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold.&lt;ref name="Cannon50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Brief History of UCPD: Berkeley, History Topic: People's Park|url = http://police.berkeley.edu/about_UCPD/ucpdhistory.html|website = police.berkeley.edu|access-date = December 9, 2015|date = August 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225256/http://police.berkeley.edu/about_UCPD/ucpdhistory.html|archive-date=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after the incident, Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, "If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement."&lt;ref name="Cannon295"&gt;Cannon (2003), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] kidnapped [[Patty Hearst]] in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked to a group of political aides about a [[botulism]] outbreak contaminating the food.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan's [[botulism]] joke is variously reported as "sometimes you wonder whether there shouldn't be an outbreak of botulism" (''Sarasota Journal'', March 7, 1974, p. 15A) and "It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of botulism" (''Los Angeles Times'', March 14, 1974, "Reagan Raps Press on Botulism Quote.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was starting to gain traction. In the early stages of the debate, Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the Therapeutic Abortion Act in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.&lt;ref name="Cannon50"/&gt; The state legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he reluctantly signed it on June 14, 1967.&lt;ref name="Cannon51"&gt;Cannon &amp; Beschloss (2001), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; About two million abortions would be performed as a result, mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.&lt;ref name="Cannon51"/&gt; Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[anti-abortion]].&lt;ref name="Cannon51"/&gt; He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald.

[[File:NIXONSandREAGANS.jpg|thumb|The Reagans meet with President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], July 1970]]

In 1967, Reagan signed the [[Mulford Act]], which repealed a law allowing the [[Open carry in the United States|public carrying]] of loaded firearms (becoming [[California Penal Code]] 12031 and 171(c)). The bill, which was named after Republican assemblyman [[Don Mulford]], garnered national attention after the [[Black Panthers]] marched bearing arms upon the [[California State Capitol]] to protest it.&lt;ref name="huey newton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_capitolmarch.html |title=From "A Huey P.

Despite an unsuccessful attempt to force a recall election on Reagan in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[https://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/13/local/me-history13 Recall Idea Got Its Start in L.A. in 1898], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; he was re-elected governor in [[1970 California gubernatorial election|1970]], defeating [[Jesse M. Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office was the controversy of [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.&lt;ref name="Rest of Me"/&gt; His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California before 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell (murderer)|Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin]]'s gas chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412–418|date=May 1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Reagan signed the Family Law Act, which was an amalgam of two bills that had been written and revised by the [[California State Legislature]] over more than two years.&lt;ref&gt;Community Property and Family Law: The Family Law Act of 1969 by Aidan R.

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work", he spoke out against the idea of the [[welfare state]]. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|access-date=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731075753/http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|archive-date=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=September 24, 1979|access-date=May 10, 2008|title=Candidate Reagan is Born Again|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514085126/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html|archive-date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.&lt;ref name="1976 Results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006023552/http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archive-date=October 6, 2006|title=1976 New Hampshire presidential Primary, February 24, 1976 Republican Results|publisher=New Hampshire Political Library|access-date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Ray Barnhart]] of [[Houston]], whom Reagan as president would appoint in 1981 as director of the [[Federal Highway Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hathorn Billy|year =2010|title =Mayor Ernest Angelo Jr., of Midland and the 96–0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976|journal=West Texas Historical Association Yearbook|volume =86|pages =77–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[1976 Republican National Convention|GOP convention]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of Pennsylvania as his [[running mate]] if nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.&lt;ref name="1976 Results"/&gt;

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a [[faithless elector]] in the November election from the state of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1976|title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789–1996|access-date=April 30, 2007|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Admin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1978: Opposition to the Briggs Initiative==
{{Main|Briggs Initiative}}
In 1978, conservative [[California State Legislature|state legislator]] [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]], sponsored a [[ballot initiative]] for the November 7, 1978 [[California]] state election (the [[Briggs Initiative]]) that sought to ban [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s from working in California's [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].&lt;ref name=identity&gt;{{cite news |last = Rimmerman |first = Craig |title = From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States |publisher = Temple University Press |date = November 2001 |isbn = 9781566399050 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0BexugIsxsC&amp;pg=PA130 |access-date = December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, California Proposition 6 was a ballot initiative put to referendum on the state ballot.&lt;ref name=date&gt;{{cite news |last = Stockton-San Joaquin County Public Library |title = Ballot Propositions June 1978 – June 1998 |publisher = Stockton-San Joaquin County Public Library |url = http://www.stockton.lib.ca.us/prophist.htm#NOV78 |access-date = December 7, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219052043/http://www.stockton.lib.ca.us/prophist.htm#NOV78 |archive-date = February 19, 2012 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early opposition was led by LGBT activists and a few progressive politicians, but to many people's surprise, Reagan moved to publicly oppose the measure.  He issued an informal letter of opposition to the initiative, told reporters that he was opposed, and wrote an editorial in the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]'' opposing it.&lt;ref name="Herald-Examiner"&gt;{{cite news |last = Reagan |first = Ronald |title = Editorial: Two Ill-advised California Trends |page = A19 |newspaper = Los Angeles Herald-Examiner |date = November 1, 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Magliocca |first1 = Gerard |title = Ronald Reagan and Gay Rights: A reproduction of the op-ed ''"Editorial: Two Ill-advised California Trends"'' by Ronald Reagan in the ''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner'' from Library of Congress |url = https://concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/10/ronald-reagan-and-gay-rights.html |website = concurringopinions.com |access-date = August 14, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814221057/https://concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/10/ronald-reagan-and-gay-rights.html |archive-date = August 14, 2017 |date = October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing of Reagan's opposition was significant, and surprised many, because he was then preparing to run for president, a race in which he would need the support of conservatives and those moderates who were uncomfortable with homosexual teachers. At that very moment, he was actively courting leaders from the [[Christian right|religious right]], including [[Jerry Falwell]], who would go on to form the [[Moral Majority]] to fight out such [[culture war]] issues the following year.&lt;ref name="White2021"&gt;{{cite news |last1=White |first1=John Kenneth |title=Kevin McCarthy should meet the Ronald Reagan of 1978 |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/556632-kevin-mccarthy-should-meet-the-ronald-reagan-of-1978 |access-date=4 June 2021 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=June 3, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Reagan biographer [[Lou Cannon]] puts it, Reagan was "well aware that there were those who wanted him to duck the issue" but nevertheless "chose to state his convictions".&lt;ref name="Carpenter2004"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carpenter |first1=Dale |title=Reagan and Gays: A Reassessment |url=https://igfculturewatch.com/2004/06/10/reagan-and-gays-a-reassessment/ |website=IGF CultureWatch |access-date=4 June 2021 |date=June 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon reports that Reagan was "repelled by the aggressive public crusades against homosexual life styles which became a staple of right wing politics in the late 1970s".&lt;ref name="Carpenter2004"/&gt; Reagan's November 1 editorial stated, in part, ""Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual's sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child's teachers do not really influence this."&lt;ref name="Herald-Examiner"/&gt;

Reagan launched his campaign with an indictment of a federal government that he believed had "overspent, overstimulated, and overregulated". After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his opponents from the primaries, [[George H. W. Bush]], to be his running mate. His relaxed and confident appearance during the televised [[1980 United States presidential debates#Second presidential debate (Public Auditorium)|Reagan–Carter debate on October 28]] boosted his popularity and helped to widen his lead in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/16/400008182/throwback-thursday-reagan-announces-run-for-president|work=NPR|title=Throwback Thursday: Reagan Announces Run for President|author=Domenico Montanaro|date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RR-C&amp;E&gt;{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/reagan/campaigns-and-elections| title=Ronald Reagan: Campaigns and Elections| last=Cannon| first=Lou| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| access-date=March 27, 2018| date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, Reagan won a decisive victory over Carter, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49 in six states plus D.C. He also won the popular vote, receiving 50.7 percent to Carter's 41.0 percent, with independent [[John B. Anderson]] garnering 6.6 percent.

Reagan's policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages.

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] to ensure America's economic strength. The program, [[Project Socrates]], developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide basis. However, Reagan's term came to an end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy", had it terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

Reagan escalated the [[Cold War]], accelerating a reversal from the policy of [[détente]] that began during the Carter administration, following the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Saur Revolution]] and subsequent [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=12594|title=Towards an International History of the War in Afghanistan, 1979–89|access-date=May 16, 2007|year=2002|publisher=The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144144/http://wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=12594|archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered a massive buildup of the [[United States Armed Forces]]&lt;ref name="apsr"/&gt; and implemented new policies that were directed towards the Soviet Union; he revived the [[B-1 Lancer]] program that had been canceled by the Carter administration, and he produced the [[MX missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/icbm/lgm-118.htm|title=LGM-118A Peacekeeper|access-date=April 10, 2007|date=August 15, 2000|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Soviet deployment of the [[SS-20]], Reagan oversaw [[NATO]]'s deployment of the [[Pershing missile]] in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/2108/grossdemo_gegen_nato_doppelbeschluss.html|title=Großdemo gegen Nato-Doppelbeschluss, Spiegel on the mass protests against deployment of nuclear weapons in West Germany|newspaper=Spiegel Online|date=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe.

In 1984, journalist [[Nicholas Lemann]] interviewed Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] and summarized the strategy of the Reagan administration to roll back the Soviet Union:

{{quote|Their society is economically weak, and it lacks the wealth, education, and technology to enter the information age. They have thrown everything into military production, and their society is starting to show terrible stress as a result. They can't sustain military production the way we can.

Lemann noted that when he wrote that in 1984, he thought the Reaganites were living in a fantasy world. But by 2016, Lemann stated that the passage represents "a fairly uncontroversial description of what Reagan actually did".&lt;ref name=TriumphTone/&gt;

After Soviet fighters downed [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] near [[Moneron Island]] on September 1, 1983, carrying 269 people, including Georgia congressman [[Larry McDonald]], Reagan labeled the act a "massacre" and declared that the Soviets had turned "against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere".&lt;ref name="k-air"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/tdih.do?id=2777&amp;action=tdihArticleCategory|title=1983: Korean Airlines flight shot down by Soviet Union|access-date=April 10, 2007|publisher=A&amp;E Television|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303205701/http://www.history.com/tdih.do?action=tdihArticleCategory&amp;id=2777|archive-date=March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all Soviet passenger air service to the United States and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the Soviets, wounding them financially.&lt;ref name="k-air"/&gt; As a result of the shootdown, and the cause of KAL 007's going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system, Reagan announced on September 16, 1983, that the [[Global Positioning System]] would be made available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pace|title=The Global Positioning System|chapter=GPS History, Chronology, and Budgets|publisher=Rand|year=1995|chapter-url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR614/MR614.appb.pdf|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Pellerin, ''United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology: New GPS satellite ushers in a range of future improvements''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A formal appeal from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at [[St. George's University]] as adequate reasons to invade.

Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to take the presidential oath of office, though this record was surpassed by [[Joe Biden]] in 2021, who was 78.&lt;ref name="oldest" /&gt; Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[1985 North American cold wave|coldest days on record]] in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the weeks that followed, he shook up his staff somewhat, moving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[James Baker]] to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary [[Donald Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer, Chief of Staff.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver Jr., "Briefing"|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====War on drugs====
{{Main|War on drugs}}

In response to concerns about the increasing [[crack epidemic]], Reagan began the war on drugs campaign in 1982, a policy led by the federal government to reduce the illegal drug trade. Though Nixon had previously declared war on drugs, Reagan advocated more aggressive policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander|first=Michelle|title=The New Jim Crow|year=2010|publisher= The New Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59558-103-7|page=5|title-link=The New Jim Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lamar |first=Jacob V., Jr|title=Rolling Out the Big Guns|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 22, 1986|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112174237/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2007|access-date=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm|title=The Drug War as Race War|access-date=April 11, 2007|author=Randall, Vernellia R.|date=April 18, 2006|publisher=The University of Dayton School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1.7|1986|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to fund the war on drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.&lt;ref name="PBS Frontline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/|title=Thirty Years of America's Drug War|access-date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was criticized for promoting significant [[Race and the war on drugs|racial disparities in the prison population]],&lt;ref name="PBS Frontline"/&gt; and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street while resulting in a tremendous financial burden for America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/341/reagan.shtml|publisher=Drug Reform Coordination Network|title=The Reagan-Era Drug War Legacy|date=June 11, 2004|access-date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use which they attribute to the Reagan administrations policies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html|title=NIDA InfoFacts: High School and Youth Trends|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH|access-date=April 4, 2007|archive-date=March 10, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310070142/http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; marijuana use among high-school seniors declined from 33 percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/kleber.html|title=Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber|access-date=June 12, 2007|publisher=PBS|quote=The politics of the Reagan years and the Bush years probably made it somewhat harder to get treatment expanded, but at the same time, it probably had a good effect in terms of decreasing initiation and use.

Nancy Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs, including alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/news/just-say-no-first-lady-wbna4297405|title=The 'just say no' first lady|publisher=[[Today.com]]|date=February 18, 2004|access-date=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to AIDS epidemic====
According to AIDS activist organizations such as [[ACT UP]] and scholars such as [[Don Francis]] and Peter S. Arno, the Reagan administration largely ignored the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS crisis]], which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, the same year Reagan took office.&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Francis |first1=Donald P |title=Deadly AIDS policy failure by the highest levels of the US government: A personal look back 30 years later for lessons to respond better to future epidemics |journal=Journal of Public Health Policy |date=August 1, 2012 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=290–300 |doi=10.1057/jphp.2012.14 |pmid=22895498 |s2cid=205127920 |language=en |issn=1745-655X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arno"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arno |first1=PS |last2=Feiden |first2=K |title=Ignoring the epidemic.

By the time President Reagan gave his first prepared speech on the epidemic, six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS, and 20,849 had died of it.&lt;ref name="Shiltz"/&gt; By 1989, the year Reagan left office, more than 100,000 people had been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States, and more than 59,000 of them had died of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current Trends First 100,000 Cases of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001442.htm |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |access-date=March 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan administration officials countered criticisms of neglect by noting that federal funding for AIDS-related programs rose over his presidency, from a few hundred thousand dollars in 1982 to $2.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 1989.&lt;ref name="KFF AIDS"&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Federal Funding for HIV/AIDS: Trends Over Time |url=https://www.kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/u-s-federal-funding-for-hivaids-trends-over-time/ |website=The Henry J.

====Addressing apartheid====
From the late 1960s onward, the American public grew increasingly vocal in its opposition to the [[apartheid]] policy of the white-[[Dominant minority|minority]] government of [[South Africa]], and in its insistence that the U.S. impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on South Africa.&lt;ref name=AT2008SApolicy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=Alex |title=U.S. Foreign Policy Towards Apartheid South Africa 1948–1994: Conflict of Interests |date=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-4039-7227-9 |pages=106–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the anti-apartheid opposition surged during Reagan's first term in office as its component [[disinvestment from South Africa]] movement, which had been in existence for quite some years, gained critical mass following in the United States, particularly on college campuses and among [[Mainline Protestant|mainline Protestant denominations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Divestment Was Just One Weapon in Battle Against Apartheid| last=Counte| first=Cecelie| date=January 27, 2013| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/27/is-divestment-an-effective-means-of-protest/divestment-was-just-one-weapon-in-battle-against-apartheid| website=nytimes.com| publisher=The New York Times Company| access-date=August 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Berger| first=Joseph| title=Protestants Seek More Divestment| date=June 10, 1986| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/us/protestants-seek-more-divestment.html| work=The New York Times| location=New York, New York|access-date=August 13, 2019| via=The Times's print archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan was opposed to divestiture because, as he wrote in a letter to [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], it "would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within South Africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government". He also noted the fact that the "American-owned industries there employ more than 80,000 blacks" and that their employment practices were "very different from the normal South African customs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Skinner| editor1-first=Kiron K.| editor2-last=Anderson| editor2-first=Annelise| editor3-last=Anderson| editor3-first= Martin| title=Reagan: A Life In Letters| year=2004| publisher=Free Press| location=New York, New York| isbn=978-0743219679| pages=520–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative strategy for opposing apartheid, the Reagan Administration developed a policy of [[constructive engagement]] with the South African government as a means of encouraging it to move away from apartheid gradually. It was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout [[southern Africa]].&lt;ref name=AT2008SApolicy/&gt; This policy, however, engendered much public criticism and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions.&lt;ref name=UngerVale&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ungar| first1=Sanford J.| last2=Vale| first2=Peter| title=South Africa: Why Constructive Engagement Failed | journal=Foreign Affairs| date=Winter 1985–86| volume=64| issue=2| url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-africa/1985-12-01/south-africa-why-constructive-engagement-failed| pages=234–258| doi=10.2307/20042571| jstor=20042571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Reagan announced the imposition of new sanctions on the South African government, including an [[arms embargo]] in late 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| last=Smith| first=William E.| title=South Africa Reagan's Abrupt Reversal| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959843,00.html| date=September 16, 1985| magazine=TIME | volume=126| issue=11 |access-date=August 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sanctions were, however, seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists, and as insufficient by the president's opponents in Congress.&lt;ref name=UngerVale/&gt; In August 1986, Congress approved the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]], which included tougher sanctions. Reagan vetoed the act, but the veto was overridden by Congress. Afterward, Reagan reiterated that his administration and "all America" opposed apartheid, and said, "the debate{{nbsp}}... was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but, instead, how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country." Several European countries as well as Japan soon followed the U.S. lead and imposed their sanctions on South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Glass| first=Andrew| title=House overrides Reagan apartheid veto, Sept. 29, 1986| date=September 27, 2017| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/29/house-overrides-reagan-apartheid-veto-sept-29-1986-243169| publisher=Politico| access-date=August 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya bombing====

Relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]], part of a group known as the "unholy trinity" and was also labeled as "our international public enemy number one" by a CIA official.&lt;ref name=iokp;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107131613/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=November 7, 2012 | title= Libya: Fury in the Isolation Ward|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 23, 1982|access-date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when [[West Berlin discotheque bombing|a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothèque]], resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman. Stating that there was "irrefutable proof" that Libya had directed the "terrorist bombing", Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the United States launched a series of [[airstrike]]s on ground targets in Libya.&lt;ref name="gs-libya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/el_dorado_canyon.htm|title=Operation El Dorado Canyon|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|date=April 25, 2005|access-date=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4-15"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_3975000/3975455.stm|title=1986:US Launches air-strike on Libya|access-date=April 19, 2008|date=April 15, 2008|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] allowed the U.S. Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the UK was supporting America's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name="4-15"/&gt; The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi's "ability to export terrorism", offering him "incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior".&lt;ref name="gs-libya"/&gt; The president addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]] after the attacks had commenced, stating, "When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office."&lt;ref name="4-15"/&gt; The attack was condemned by many countries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution 41/38 which "condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r038.htm |title=A/RES/41/38 November 20, 1986 |publisher=United Nations |access-date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon, many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans."&lt;ref name="immigration"&gt;Reagan, Ronald.

Retrieved August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan also said, "The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element.

In 1986, the Iran–Contra affair became a problem for the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] to fund the [[Contras|Contra]] rebels [[Nicaraguan Revolution|fighting against the government in Nicaragua]], which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress.&lt;ref name="I-C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/|title=Understanding the Iran-Contra Affairs|website=www.brown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/reagan.years/whitehouse/iran.html|title=The Iran Contra scandal|year=2001|access-date=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair became a [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|political scandal]] in the United States during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Parry, Robert|author-link=Robert Parry (journalist)|title=NYT's apologies miss the point|publisher=Consortium for Independent Journalism|date=June 2, 2004|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2004/060204.html|access-date=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Court of Justice]], whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrison, Fred L. |title=Legal Issues in The Nicaragua Opinion |journal=American Journal of International Law |date=January 1, 1987 |volume=81 |pages=160–166 |doi=10.2307/2202146 |issn=0002-9300 |issue=1 |first=F.

President Reagan professed that he was unaware of the plot's existence. He opened his own investigation and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat, [[John Tower]], [[Brent Scowcroft]] and [[Edmund Muskie]], respectively, to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible.&lt;ref name="mixed WH"&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/213195.stm|title=Reagan's mixed White House legacy|access-date=August 19, 2007|date=June 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate report by Congress concluded that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have."&lt;ref name="mixed WH"/&gt; Reagan's popularity declined from 67 percent to 46 percent in less than a week, the most significant and quickest decline ever for a president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link1=Jane Mayer|last1=Mayer|first1=Jane|author-link2=Doyle McManus|last2=McManus|first2=Doyle|date=1988|title=Landslide: The Unmaking of The President, 1984–1988|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=978-0-395-45185-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/landslideunmakin00maye_0/page/292 292, 437]|url=https://archive.org/details/landslideunmakin00maye_0/page/292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal resulted in eleven convictions and fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dwyer|first=Paula|work=Business Week|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/25/b353254.htm|title=Pointing a Finger at Reagan|date=June 23, 1997|access-date=August 23, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807235718/http://businessweek.com/1997/25/b353254.htm|archive-date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 1980s, the United States had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed.&lt;ref name="us-ussr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/EM27.cfm|title=New Evidence of Moscow's Military Threat|access-date=May 13, 2007|last=Hamm|first=Manfred R.|date=June 23, 1983|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205953/http://heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/EM27.cfm|archive-date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm|title=Reagan and the Russians|date=February 1994|work=The Atlantic|last1=Lebow |first1=Richard Ned |last2=Stein |first2=Janice Gross |name-list-style=amp |access-date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; their enormous military expenses, in combination with [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized agriculture]] and inefficient [[planned economy|planned manufacturing]], were a heavy burden for the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]]. At the same time, oil prices in 1985 fell to one third of the previous level; oil was the primary source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s tenure.&lt;ref name="Gaidar"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaidar|first=Yegor|title=Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2007|pages=190–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Reagan escalated the rhetoric. In his famous 1983 speech to religious fundamentalists, he outlined his strategy for victory. First, he labeled the Soviet system an "[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]" and a failure—its demise would be a godsend for the world. Second, Reagan explained his strategy was an arms buildup that would leave the Soviets far behind, with no choice but to negotiate arms reduction. Finally, displaying his characteristic optimism, he praised liberal democracy and promised that such a system eventually would triumph over Soviet communism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Rowland and John M.

Reagan appreciated the revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and shifted to diplomacy, intending to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.&lt;ref name="Knopf"/&gt; He and Gorbachev held [[List of Soviet Union–United States summits#Cold War (1985–1991)|four summit conferences]] between 1985 and 1988: the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|first]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], the [[Reykjavík Summit|second]] in [[Reykjavík, Iceland]], the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Atwood Lawrence, "The Era of Epic Summitry."

To the astonishment of the world, and the chagrin of Reagan's most conservative supporters, they agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. Gorbachev then asked the end of SDI. Reagan said no, claiming that it was defensive only, and that he would share the secrets with the Soviets. No deal was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Lewis Gaddis|title=The Cold War: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62VjS6A6-q0C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2006|page=31|isbn=9781440684500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the [[Berlin Wall]] on June 12, 1987, five years after his first visit to [[West Berlin]] as president, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate!

At Gorbachev's visit to Washington in December 1987, he and Reagan signed the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/inf1.html#treaty|title=INF Treaty|access-date=May 28, 2007|publisher=US State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or [[START I]]; Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy|title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy|last=Lettow|first=Paul|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=July 20, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411222123/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy|archive-date=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. "No," he replied, "I was talking about another time, another era."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Talbott|first=Strobe|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 5, 1991|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973554-5,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217044817/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973554-5,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 17, 2010|title=The Summit Goodfellas|access-date=January 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Gorbachev's request, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 713.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Early in his presidency, Reagan started wearing a custom-made, technologically advanced [[hearing aid]], first in his right ear&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |access-date=June 13, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Reagan Begins to Wear a Hearing Aid in Public |last=Weisman |first=Steven R. |date=September 8, 1983 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/us/reagan-begins-to-wear-a-hearing-aid-in-public.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his left ear as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |agency=United Press International |access-date=June 13, 2008 |date=March 21, 1985 |title=Reagan Begins Using A Second Hearing Aid |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/21/us/reagan-begins-using-a-second-hearing-aid.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small, audio-amplifying device boosted their sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-08-09-austin-hearing-aid_x.htm |title=He amplifies hearing aids |access-date=June 13, 2008 |work=[[USA Today]] |last=Friess |first=Steve |date=August 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] to remove cancerous [[Polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. He relinquished presidential power to the vice president for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the [[25th Amendment]], which he specifically avoided invoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/812.html |title=What is the 25th Amendment and When Has It Been Invoked?|publisher=History News Network |access-date=June 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bumgarner, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day.&lt;ref&gt;Bumgarner, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/us/irritated-skin-is-removed-from-side-of-reagan-s-nose.html |title='Irritated Skin' is Removed from Side of Reagan's Nose |access-date=June 13, 2008 |last=Boyd |first=Gerald M. |date=August 2, 1985 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, more skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/weekinreview/balancing-the-budget-and-politics-more-cancer-on-reagan-s-nose.html |title=Balancing the Budget and Politics; More Cancer on Reagan's Nose |access-date=June 13, 2008 |date=October 13, 1987 |last1=Herron |first1=Caroline Rand |author2=Michael Wright |name-list-style=amp |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1987, Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged [[prostate]] that caused further worries about his health.

===Judiciary===
{{Main|Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates|List of federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan}}

During the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan pledged that he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice if given the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; That opportunity came during his first year in office when [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Potter Stewart]] retired; Reagan selected [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], who was [[Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|confirmed]] unanimously by the Senate. In his second term, Reagan had three opportunities to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. When [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger]] retired in September 1986, Reagan nominated [[incumbent]] Associate Justice [[William Rehnquist]] to succeed Burger as Chief Justice (the appointment of an incumbent associate justice as chief justice is subject to a separate confirmation process). Then, following Rehnquist's confirmation, the president named [[Antonin Scalia]] to fill the consequent associate justice vacancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Davis| first=Sue| title=Justice Rehnquist and the Constitution| chapter=Chapter 10.

Powell Jr.]] announced his intention to retire. Reagan initially chose Conservative jurist [[Robert Bork]] to succeed Powell. [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|Bork's nomination]] was strongly opposed by civil and women's rights groups, and by Senate Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Washington; Kennedy And Bork|access-date=April 28, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/opinion/washington-kennedy-and-bork.html|author=Reston, James|date=July 5, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; That October, after a contentious Senate debate, the nomination was rejected by a [[Recorded vote|roll call vote]] of 42–58.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Greenhouse, Linda|title=Bork's Nomination Is Rejected, 58–42; Reagan 'Saddened'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/bork-s-nomination-is-rejected-58-42-reagan-saddened.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1987|access-date=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Reagan announced his intention to nominate [[Douglas H. Ginsburg|Douglas Ginsburg]] to the Court. However, before his name was submitted to the Senate, Ginsburg withdrew himself from consideration.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/ginsburg.htm Media Frenzies in Our Time]," Special to ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Kennedy]] was subsequently nominated and confirmed as Powell's successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/myweb/justice/kennedy.htm|title=Anthony M.

Along with his four Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]], and 290 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Early in his presidency, Reagan appointed [[Clarence M. Pendleton Jr.]] of [[San Diego]] as the first African American to chair the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. Pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the [[Equal pay for equal work|comparable worth]] proposal as being "[[Looney Tunes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Pendleton, Clarence M.

===Assault===
On April 13, 1992, Reagan was assaulted by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an award from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/16/us/protester-at-reagan-speech-had-press-credentials.html |title=Protester at Reagan Speech Had Press Credentials |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protester, [[Richard Springer]], smashed a {{convert|2|ft|cm|adj=mid|spell=in|-high}}, {{convert|30|lb|adj=on}} crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president.

He pled guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.deseret.com/1992/10/23/19011994/activist-pleads-guilty-in-reagan-attack|title=Activist pleads guilty in Reagan attack |work=[[Deseret News]] |access-date=October 29, 2020|date=October 23, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp.&amp;nbsp;635–638&lt;/ref&gt; foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War,&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; and a restoration of American pride and morale.&lt;ref name="cannon746"/&gt; Proponents say that he had an unabated and passionate love for the United States which restored faith in the [[American Dream]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/02/rollins.reagan/|title=Ronald Reagan restored faith in America|access-date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook for the future of the United States during the 1980 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lipset |first1=Seymour Martin |last2=Schneider |first2=William |title=The Decline of Confidence in American Institutions |url=http://www.planethan.com/drupal/sites/default/files/The%20Decline%20of%20Confidence%20in%20American%20Institutions%20%20By%20Lipset%20Seymour%20Martin%20and%20Schneider%20William%20Political%20Science%20Quarterly%20Fall83%20Vol%2098%20Issue%203%20p379.pdf |website=Political Science Quarterly |access-date=July 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822132334/http://www.planethan.com/drupal/sites/default/files/The%20Decline%20of%20Confidence%20in%20American%20Institutions%20%20By%20Lipset%20Seymour%20Martin%20and%20Schneider%20William%20Political%20Science%20Quarterly%20Fall83%20Vol%2098%20Issue%203%20p379.pdf |archive-date=August 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits,&lt;ref name="Cannon128"/&gt; a wider [[Wealth inequality in the United States|gap in wealth]], and an increase in [[homelessness]]&lt;ref name="DreierNation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fredericksburg.com/opinionop-ed/don-t-add-reagan-s-face-to-mount-rushmore/article_9a329ef8-6d41-5a80-80b5-085a28f07316.html|title=Don't add Reagan's Face to Mount Rushmore|first=Peter|last=Dreier|work=[[The Nation]]|date=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilman|first=Larry|url=http://www.espionageinfo.com/Int-Ke/Iran-Contra-Affair.html|title=Iran-Contra Affair|publisher=Advameg|access-date=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policymakers and journalists differ as well. [[Edwin Feulner]], president of [[The Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'{{nbsp}}... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feulner|first=Edwin J.|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|access-date=August 23, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205706/http://heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|archive-date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|access-date=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 2004|access-date=August 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication and pragmatic compromising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|title=American President|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011080053/http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|archive-date=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, since Reagan left office, historians have reached a broad consensus that he rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably [[pragmatic conservatism]] that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and [[American exceptionalism]], and contributed to victory in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=David|title=Ronald Reagan and the 1980s: Perceptions, Policies, Legacies.

===Cold War===
In 2017, a C-SPAN survey of scholars ranked Reagan in terms of leadership in comparison with all 42 presidents. He ranked number nine in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://static.c-span.org/assets/documents/presidentSurvey/2017%20C-SPAN%20Presidential%20Survey%20Scores%20and%20Ranks%20FINAL.PDF "C-SPAN 2017 Survey of Presidential Leadership" '' C-SPAN'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Johns|editor-first=Andrew L.|title=A Companion to Ronald Reagan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaueBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|year=2015|publisher=Wiley|pages=1–2|isbn=9781118607824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's major achievement was the end of the Cold War as he left office. Furthermore, the USSR and Soviet-sponsored Communist movements worldwide were falling apart—and collapsed completely three years after he left office. The U.S. thus became the only superpower. His admirers say he won the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Peter Schweizer, ''Reagan's War: The Epic Story of his Forty Year Struggle and Final Triumph Over Communism'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; After 40 years of high tension, the USSR pulled back in the last years of Reagan's second term. In 1989, the Kremlin lost control of all its East European satellites. In 1991, Communism was overthrown in the USSR, and on December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. The resulting states were no threat to the United States. Reagan's exact role is debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism—together with his summits with General Secretary Gorbachev—played a significant part in ending the Cold War.&lt;ref name="American Dreamer"&gt;{{Cite news|title=American Dreamer |last1=Meacham|first1=John |last2=Murr|first2=Andrew |last3=Clift|first3=Eleanor |last4=Lipper|first4=Tamara |last5=Breslau|first5=Karen |last6=Ordonez|first6=Jennifer|date=June 14, 2004|work=Newsweek|access-date=June 3, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/54017?tid=relatedcl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopf"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knopf, PhD|first=Jeffery W.|date=August 2004|title=Did Reagan Win the Cold War?|journal=Strategic Insights|volume=III|issue=8|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=444565|access-date=August 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first president to reject containment and détente and to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with, a post-Détente strategy,&lt;ref name="Knopf"/&gt; a conviction that was vindicated by [[Gennadi Gerasimov]], the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev, who said that the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] was "very successful blackmail.{{nbsp}}...The Soviet economy couldn't endure such competition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Richard Ned|last1=Lebow|first2=Janice Gross|last2=Stein|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm|title=Reagan and the Russians|journal=The Atlantic|date=February 1994|access-date=February 11, 2017|volume=273|issue=2|pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's aggressive rhetoric toward the USSR had mixed effects; Jeffery W.

After leaving office, Reagan became an iconic influence within the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/ronald-reagan-remains-potent-republican-icon-115743569/174531.html|title=Ronald Reagan Remains Potent Republican Icon

''Washington Post'' reporter [[Carlos Lozada (journalist)|Carlos Lozada]] noted how the main Republican contenders in the 2016 presidential race adopted "standard GOP Gipper worship".&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Lozada, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/07/30/i-just-binge-read-eight-books-by-donald-trump-heres-what-i-learned/?hpid=z1 "I just binge-read eight books by Donald Trump. Here's what I learned: From memoirs to financial advice to politics, inside the collected writings of Donald J. Trump]", ''The Washington Post'', July 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies that concerned taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the [[Cold War]] is known today as the [[Reagan Era]]. This time period emphasized that the conservative "Reagan Revolution", led by Reagan, had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] is often treated as an extension of the Reagan Era, as is the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Godwin, ''Clintonomics: How Bill Clinton Reengineered the Reagan Revolution'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Eric Foner]] noted that the Obama candidacy in 2008 "aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, [http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/122382.html "Obama the Professional"], ''The Nation'', January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
