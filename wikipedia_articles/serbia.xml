It is situated in the southern [[Pannonian Plain]] and central [[Balkans]], and borders [[Hungary]] to the north, [[Romania]] to the northeast, [[Bulgaria]] to the southeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the south, [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to the west, and [[Montenegro]] to the southwest; while claiming a border with [[Albania]] through the [[political status of Kosovo|disputed]] territory of [[Kosovo]].{{NoteTag|name=Kosovo|{{Kosovo-note}}}}&lt;!--- Please discuss on the talk page (heading "Albania borders Kosovo") before editing the foregoing sentence. ---&gt; Serbia has a population of roughly 7 million, with [[Belgrade]] as its capital and [[List of cities in Serbia|largest city]].

Continuously inhabited since the [[Paleolithic age|Paleolithic Age]], the territory of modern-day Serbia faced [[Slavic migrations]] in the 6th century, establishing several regional [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|states]] in the early Middle Ages at times recognised as tributaries to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] and [[Royal Hungary|Hungarian]] kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] obtained recognition by the [[Holy See]] and [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 1217, reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived [[Serbian Empire]]. By the mid-16th century, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia; their rule was [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|at times interrupted]] by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], which began expanding towards [[Central Serbia]] from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in [[Vojvodina]]. In the early 19th century, the [[Serbian Revolution]] established the [[Principality of Serbia|nation-state]] as the region's first [[constitutional monarchy]], which subsequently expanded its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://staff.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture5.html |title = The Serbian Revolution and the Serbian State |publisher = Steven W.

Historically, authors have mentioned the [[Serbs]] ({{lang-sr|Srbi}} / Срби) and the [[Sorbs]] of Eastern Germany ([[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]: ''Serbja''; [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]]: ''Serby'') in a variety of ways: ''Cervetiis'' (''Servetiis''), ''gentis (S)urbiorum'', ''Suurbi'', ''Sorabi'', ''Soraborum'', ''Sorabos'', ''Surpe'', ''Sorabici'', ''Sorabiet'', ''Sarbin'', ''Swrbjn'', ''Servians'', ''Sorbi'', ''Sirbia, Sribia, Zirbia, Zribia'', ''Suurbelant'', ''Surbia'', ''Serbulia'' / ''Sorbulia'' among others.{{sfn|Petković|1926|p=9}}&lt;ref name="Łuczyński" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuster-Šewc|first=Heinz|title=Порекло и историја етнонима Serb "Лужички Србин"|publisher=Пројекат Растко - Будишин|translator=Petrović, Tanja|website=rastko.rs|language=sr|url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-lu/jezik/hsuster-srbin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors used these names to refer to Serbs and Sorbs in areas where their historical and current presence is not disputable (notably in the [[Balkans]] and [[Lusatia]]). However, there are also sources that mention the same or similar names in other parts of the World (most notably in the Asiatic [[Sarmatia]] in the [[Caucasus]]).

There exist two prevailing theories on the origin of the ethnonym ''*Sŕbъ'' (plur. ''*Sŕby''), one from a [[Proto-Slavic language]] with an appellative meaning of a "family kinship" and "alliance", while another from an [[Sarmatians|Iranian-Sarmatian]] [[Scythian languages|language]] with various meanings.&lt;ref name="Łuczyński"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Łuczyński |first=Michal |date=2017 |title="Geograf Bawarski" — nowe odczytania |trans-title="Bavarian Geographer" — New readings |url=https://rcin.org.pl/dlibra/show-content/publication/edition/64469?id=64469 |language=pl |journal=Polonica |volume=XXXVII |issue=37 |page=71 |doi=10.17651/POLON.37.9 |access-date=4 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudnicki1959"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudnicki|first=Mikołaj|author-link=Mikołaj Rudnicki|title=Prasłowiańszczyzna, Lechia-Polska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9IeAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Państwowe wydawn. naukowe, Oddzia ︢w Poznaniu|language=pl|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] suggests that the Serbs originated from [[White Serbia]] near [[Francia]]. According to the recorded tradition the [[Sorbs (tribe)|White Serbs]] split in two, with the half that became known as the Serbs coming down to settle Byzantine land. From 1815 to 1882 the official name for Serbia was the [[Principality of Serbia]], from 1882 to 1918 it was renamed to the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], later from 1945 to 1963, the official name for Serbia was the People's Republic of Serbia, later renamed the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] from 1963 to 1990. Since 1990, the official name of the country has been the Republic of Serbia.

Archaeological evidence of [[Paleolithic]] settlements on the territory of present-day Serbia is scarce. A fragment of a human jaw was found in [[Sićevo]] (Mala Balanica) and is believed to be up to 525,000–397,000 years old.{{sfn|Roksandic|2011|p=186–196}}

Approximately around 6,500 years BC, during the [[Neolithic]], the [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]], and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] cultures existed in the region of modern-day Belgrade. They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]] (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vinča-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejović|1988|p=}}

During the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Niš]]).

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].

The chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: [[Singidunum]] (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Niš), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirković|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanović|Mihajlović|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].

When the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. At the same time, its northwestern parts were included in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. By the 6th century, [[South Slavs]] migrated into the European provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in large numbers.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956|p=84}} They merged with the local [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanised]] population that was gradually assimilated.{{sfn|Stipčević|1977|p=76}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=38, 41}}{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=533}}

===Middle Ages===

White Serbs, an [[early Slavic]] tribe from [[White Serbia]] eventually settled in an area between the [[Sava]] river and the [[Dinaric Alps]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=52-53}}{{sfn|Ivić|1995|p=9}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=11}} By the beginning of the 9th century, Serbia achieved a level of statehood.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=141}} [[Christianization of the Slavs|Christianization]] of Serbia was a gradual process, finalized by the middle of the 9th century.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=15-17}} In the mid-10th-century, the [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Serbian state]] stretched between the [[Adriatic Sea]], the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. During the 11th and 12th century, [[Grand Principality of Serbia|Serbian state]] frequently fought with the neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=23-24}} Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] in 1217,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=38}} and an [[Serbian Empire|empire]] in 1346,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=64}} under [[Stefan Dušan]]. [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was organized as an [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] archbishopric in 1219,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=28}} through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint, and in 1346 it was raised to the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć|Patriarchate]]. Monuments of the Nemanjić period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]].

During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part (modern [[Vojvodina]]), was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period after 1371, known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into several principalities, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=84-85}} The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459. The Ottoman threat and eventual conquest saw massive migrations of Serbs to the west and north.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=107-108}}

===Ottoman and Habsburg rule===

In all Serbian lands conquered by the Ottomans, the native nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman rulers, while much of the clergy fled or were confined to the isolated monasteries. Under the Ottoman system, Serbs, as well as Christians, were considered an [[rayah|inferior class]] of people and subjected to heavy taxes, and a portion of the Serbian population experienced [[Islamization]]. Many Serbs were recruited during the [[devshirme]] system, a form of [[slavery in the Ottoman Empire]], in which boys from Balkan Christian families were [[Forced conversion|forcibly converted]] to [[Islam]] and trained for infantry units of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] known as the [[Janissaries]].{{sfn|A ́goston|Masters|2010|p=383}}{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2001|p=251}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=62}} The [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] was extinguished in 1463,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=134}} but reestablished in 1557,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=135-136}}{{sfn|Fotić|2008|p=519–520}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|p=143–169}} providing for limited continuation of Serbian cultural traditions within the Ottoman Empire, under the [[Millet system]].{{sfn|Runciman|1968|p=204}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=115}}

After the loss of statehood to the Ottoman Empire, Serbian resistance continued in northern regions (modern Vojvodina), under titular despots (until 1537), and popular leaders like [[Jovan Nenad]] (1526–1527). From 1521 to 1552, Ottomans conquered Belgrade and regions of Syrmia, Bačka, and Banat.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=115, 119}} Continuing wars and various rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule. One of the most significant was the [[Banat Uprising]] in 1594 and 1595, which was part of the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1593–1606) between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=141–142}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|p=163–164}} The area of modern Vojvodina endured a century-long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], partially by the [[Treaty of Karlovci]] (1699),{{sfn|Pešalj|2010|p=29-42}} and fully by the [[Treaty of Požarevac]] (1718).{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}}

[[File:Serbmigra.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]], led by Patriarch [[Arsenije III Čarnojević]]]]

As the [[Great Serb Migrations]] depopulated most of southern Serbia, the Serbs sought refuge across the Danube River in [[Vojvodina]] to the north and the [[Military Frontier]] in the west, where they were granted rights by the Austrian crown under measures such as the ''Statuta Wallachorum'' of 1630. Much of central Serbia switched from Ottoman rule to [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686–91)|Habsburg control (1686–91)]] during the [[Great Turkish War|Habsburg-Ottoman war (1683–1699)]]. Following several petitions, Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] formally granted Serbs who wished to settle in the northern regions the right to their autonomous [[crown land]].{{sfn|Todorović|2006|p=7–8}} The ecclesiastical centre of the Serbs also moved northwards, to the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]],{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=150}} and the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] was once-again abolished by the Ottomans in 1766.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=94}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=177}} 

In 1718–39, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] occupied much of [[Central Serbia]] and established the [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39)|Kingdom of Serbia]] as [[crownland]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}} Those gains were lost by the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] in 1739, when the Ottomans retook the region.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=176}} Apart from territory of modern Vojvodina which remained under the Habsburg Empire, central regions of Serbia were occupied once again by the Habsburgs in [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788–92)|1788–1792]].

===Revolution and independence===
{{Main|Serbian Revolution|Principality of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia}}
The [[Serbian Revolution]] for independence from the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=193-204}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=29-32}}{{sfn|Radosavljević|2010|p=171-178}}{{sfn|Rajić|2010|p=143-148}} The revolution comprised two separate uprisings which gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire (1830) that eventually evolved towards full independence (1878). During the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804–1813), led by vožd [[Karađorđe Petrović]], Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=179-183}} Shortly after this, the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] began in 1815. Led by [[Miloš Obrenović]], it ended with a compromise between Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=190-196}} Likewise, Serbia was one of the first nations in the Balkans to abolish [[feudalism]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=191}} The [[Akkerman Convention]] in 1826, the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] in 1829 and finally, the [[Hatt-i Sharif]], recognised the [[suzerainty]] of Serbia. The [[Sretenje Constitution|First Serbian Constitution]] was adopted on 15 February 1835 (the anniversary of the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising), making the country one of the first to adopt a democratic constitution in Europe.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=248–250}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=195}} 15 February is now commemorated as [[Statehood Day (Serbia)|Statehood Day]], a [[Public holidays in Serbia|public holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fim.edu.rs/en/statehood-day-of-the-republic-of-serbia-2019/ |title=Statehood Day of the Republic of Serbia 2019 |website=School of Engineering Management (Belgrade) |access-date=12 February 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the clashes between the Ottoman army and Serbs in Belgrade in 1862,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=214-215}} and under pressure from the [[Great Powers]], by 1867 the last Turkish soldiers left the Principality, making the country ''de facto'' independent.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=246}} By enacting a new constitution in 1869,{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=58}} without consulting the Porte, [[Jovan Ristic|Serbian diplomats]] confirmed the ''de facto'' independence of the country. In 1876, Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, siding with the ongoing Christian uprisings in [[Uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1875-1878)|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Bulgarian Uprising of 1876|Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=63-64}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=224}}

The formal independence of the country was internationally recognised at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]; this treaty, however, prohibited Serbia from uniting with other Serbian regions by placing Bosnia and Herzegovina under [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, alongside the occupation of the region of [[Raška (region)|Raška]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=225}} From 1815 to 1903, the Principality of Serbia was ruled by the [[House of Obrenović]], save for the rule of Prince [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]] between 1842 and 1858. In 1882, Principality of Serbia became the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], ruled by [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=70}} The [[House of Karađorđević]], descendants of the revolutionary leader Karađorđe Petrović, assumed power in 1903 following the [[May Overthrow]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=73}} 
In the north, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolution in Austria]] led to the establishment of the autonomous territory of [[Serbian Vojvodina]]; by 1849, the region was transformed into the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=203}}

===The Balkan Wars and World War I===
{{Main|Balkan Wars|Serbian Campaign of World War I|}}
In the course of the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, the [[Balkan League]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] and captured its [[Treaty of London, 1913|European territories]], which enabled territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Serbia into regions of [[Raška (region)|Raška]], [[Kosovo (region)|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Vardarian Macedonia]]. The [[Second Balkan War]] soon ensued when Bulgaria turned on its former allies, but was defeated, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In two years, Serbia enlarged its territory by 80% and its population by 50%,&lt;ref name="Collection of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum 1914"&gt;{{cite web | title=Serbia - Countries | website=Collection of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum | date=1914-06-28 | url=https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/countries/20069818/ | access-date=2021-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also suffered high casualties on the eve of World War I, with more than 36,000 dead.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=135}} Austria-Hungary became wary of the rising regional power on its borders and its potential to become an anchor for unification of Serbs and other South Slavs, and the relationship between the two countries became tense.

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June 1914 in [[Sarajevo]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the [[Young Bosnia]] organisation, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, on 28 July.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=246-247}} Local war escalated when [[German Empire|Germany]] declared war on [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and invaded [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Belgium]], thus drawing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] into the conflict that became the [[First World War]]. Serbia won the first major battles of World War I, including the [[Battle of Cer]],{{sfn|Mitrović|2007|p=69}} and the [[Battle of Kolubara]], marking the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victories against the [[Central Powers]] in World War I.{{sfn|Mitrović|2007|p=104}}

King Peter was succeeded by his son, Alexander, in August 1921. Serb centralists and Croat autonomists clashed in the parliament, and most governments were fragile and short-lived. [[Nikola Pašić]], a conservative prime minister, headed or dominated most governments until his death. King Alexander established a [[6 January Dictatorship|dictatorship]] in 1929 with the aim of establishing the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav ideology]] and single [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav nation]], changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia and changed the internal divisions from the 33 [[oblasts]] to nine new [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]]. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs living in Yugoslavia from the idea of unity.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=624}}

Alexander was assassinated in [[Marseille]], during an official visit in 1934 by [[Vlado Chernozemski]], member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMRO]]. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] and a regency council was headed by his cousin, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]]. In August 1939 the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] established an autonomous [[Banate of Croatia]] as a solution to Croatian concerns.
[[File:Fascist_occupation_of_yugoslavia.png|alt=|left|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]] after the occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis and neighbouring puppet states during World War II]]

In 1941, in spite of Yugoslav attempts to remain neutral in the war, the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia. The territory of modern Serbia was divided between Hungary, Bulgaria, the Independent State of Croatia and Italy (Greater Albania and Montenegro), while the remaining part of the occupied Serbia was placed under the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|military administration]] of [[Nazi Germany]], with [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian puppet governments]] led by [[Milan Aćimović]] and [[Milan Nedić]] assisted by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]]'s fascist organization [[Yugoslav National Movement]] (Zbor).

The Yugoslav territory was the scene of a civil war between [[Chetniks|royalist Chetniks]] commanded by [[Draža Mihailović]] and [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|communist partisans]] commanded by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Axis auxiliary units of the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and the [[Serbian State Guard]] fought against both of these forces. [[Siege of Kraljevo]] was a major battle of the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Uprising in Serbia]], led by Chetnik forces against the Nazis. Several days after the battle began the German forces committed a massacre of approximately 2,000 civilians in an event known as the [[Kraljevo massacre]], in a reprisal for the attack. [[Loznica|Draginac and Loznica massacre]] of 2,950 villagers in Western Serbia in 1941 was the first large execution of civilians in occupied Serbia by [[Nazi|German]]s, with [[Kragujevac massacre]] and [[Novi Sad Raid]] of Jews and Serbs by Hungarian fascists being the most notorious, with over 3,000 victims in each case.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Kragujevac massacre |first=Karl |last=Savich |url=http://www.pogledi.rs/kragujevac/english/1e.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217101508/http://www.pogledi.rs/kragujevac/english/1e.php |archive-date=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After one year of occupation, around 16,000 [[Serbian Jews]] were murdered in the area, or around 90% of its pre-war Jewish population during [[The Holocaust in Serbia]].

During this period, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs fled the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and sought refuge in German-occupied Serbia, seeking to escape the large-scale persecution and genocide of Serbs, Jews, and Roma being committed by the [[Ustaše]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Britannica OnlineEncyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620426/Ustasa|title=Ustaša|publisher=Britannica.com|access-date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Josip Broz Tito]] himself, Serbs made up the vast majority of [[Anti-fascism|Anti-fascist]] fighters and [[Yugoslav Partisans]] for the whole course of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tito |first=Josip Broz |date=1945 |title=Nacionalno pitanje u Jugoslaviji: u svjetlosti narodnooslobodilačke borbe |location=Zagreb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPsfnQEACAAJ |publisher=Naprijed |language=hr |page=11 |quote=Moram ovdje podvući činjenicu da su u redovima naše Narodno-oslbodilačke vojske i partizanskih odreda u Jugoslaviji, od samog početka pa do danas, nalaze u ogromnoj većini baš Srbi, umjesto da to bude obratno.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Užice]] was a short-lived liberated territory established by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] and the first liberated territory in World War II Europe, organised as a military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in the west of [[Serbia under German occupation|occupied Serbia]].

The victory of the Communist Partisans resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and a subsequent constitutional referendum. A [[one-party state]] was soon established in Yugoslavia by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]. It is claimed between 60,000 and 70,000 people died in Serbia during the [[Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45|1944–45 communist takeover and purge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tanjug |url=http://www.mondo.rs/a622628/Info/Drustvo/Posle-rata-u-Srbiji-streljano-preko-60.000-civila.html |title=Posle rata u Srbiji streljano preko 60.000 civila |publisher=Mondo.rs }}&lt;/ref&gt; All opposition was suppressed and people deemed to be promoting opposition to socialism or promoting separatism were imprisoned or executed for sedition. Serbia became a [[constituent state|constituent republic]] within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFRY]] known as the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], and had a republic-branch of the federal communist party, the [[League of Communists of Serbia]].
[[File:Konferencija_Pokreta_nesvrstanih_1961._godine.jpg|thumb|right|The principle of non-alignment was the core of Yugoslav and later Serbian diplomacy. The First [[Non-Aligned Movement]] Summit Conference took place in [[Belgrade]] in September [[1961]]]]

Serbia's most powerful and influential politician in Tito-era Yugoslavia was [[Aleksandar Ranković]], one of the "big four" Yugoslav leaders, alongside Tito, [[Edvard Kardelj]], and [[Milovan Đilas]]. Ranković was later removed from the office because of the disagreements regarding Kosovo's [[nomenklatura]] and the unity of Serbia. Ranković's dismissal was highly unpopular among Serbs. Pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a distinctive "[[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslim]]" nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs on a large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] as an [[Albanian language]] institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs of being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Melissa Katherine |last1=Bokovoy |first2=Jill A. |last2=Irvine |first3=Carol S. |last3=Lilly |title=State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992 |location=Scranton, Pennsylvania |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1997 |pages=295–296, 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakup of Yugoslavia and political transition===
{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|History of Serbia#Independent Serbia (2006–present)}}

In 1989, [[Slobodan Milošević]] rose to power in Serbia. Milošević promised a reduction of powers for the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, where his allies subsequently took over power, during the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5np99Vgc0YC&amp;q=anti-bureaucratic+revolution&amp;pg=PA165|title=The Destruction of Yugoslavia: tracking the break-up 1980–92 (pp 165–170)|first=Branka|last=Magaš|year=1993|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-593-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ignited tensions between the communist leadership of the other republics of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and awoke ethnic nationalism across Yugoslavia that eventually resulted in its [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]], with [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] declaring independence during 1991 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/world/breakup-of-yugoslavia-leaves-slovenia-secure-croatia-shaky.html|work=The New York Times|title=Breakup of Yugoslavia Leaves Slovenia Secure, Croatia Shaky|first=Stephen|last=Engelberg|date=16 January 1992|access-date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=March 2017}} Serbia and Montenegro remained together as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY).&lt;ref name=SCGSuccession /&gt; However, according to the [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia|Badinter Commission]], the country was not legally considered a continuation of the former SFRY, but a new state.

Fueled by ethnic tensions, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991–2001) erupted, with the most severe conflicts taking place in [[War in Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], where the large ethnic Serb communities opposed independence from Yugoslavia. The FRY remained outside the conflicts, but provided logistic, military and financial support to Serb forces in the wars. In response, the UN imposed [[sanctions against Serbia]] which led to political isolation and the collapse of the economy (GDP decreased from $24 billion in 1990 to under $10 billion in 1993). Serbia was in the 2000s sued on the charges of alleged genocide by neighbouring [[Bosnian genocide case|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia–Serbia genocide case|Croatia]] but in both cases the main charges against Serbia were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2007-02-26|title=Serbia not guilty of genocide|url=https://humanrightshouse.org/articles/serbia-not-guilty-of-genocide-2/|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Human Rights House Foundation|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2015-02-03|title=UN court dismisses Croatia and Serbia genocide claims|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31104973|access-date=2021-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Multi-party democracy was introduced in Serbia in 1990, officially dismantling the one-party system. Critics of Milošević stated that the government continued to be authoritarian despite constitutional changes, as Milošević maintained strong political influence over the state media and security apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt1.pdf|title=Political Propaganda and the Plan to Create a "State for all Serbs" |access-date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wide Angle, Milosevic and the Media.''

After [[2000 Yugoslavian general election|presidential elections]] in September 2000, opposition parties accused Milošević of [[electoral fraud]]. A campaign of [[civil resistance]] followed, led by the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS), a broad coalition of anti-Milošević parties. This culminated on 5 October when half a million people from all over the country congregated in Belgrade, compelling Milošević to concede defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Vejvoda, 'Civil Society versus Slobodan Milošević: Serbia 1991–2000', in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present.''

On 21 May 2006, Montenegro held a [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|referendum]] to determine whether to end its union with Serbia. The results showed 55.4% of voters in favour of independence, which was just above the 55% required by the referendum. This was followed on 5 June 2006 by Serbia's declaration of independence, marking the final dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and the re-emergence of Serbia as an independent state, for the first time since 1918. On the same occasion, the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] declared Serbia to be the legal successor to the former state union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5083690.stm|title=Montenegro gets Serb recognition|publisher=BBC|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain of the central part of the country, with the region of [[Šumadija]] at its heart, consists chiefly of hills traversed by rivers. Mountains dominate the southern third of Serbia. [[Dinaric Alps]] stretch in the west and the southwest, following the flow of the rivers [[Drina]] and [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Serbia}}
The climate of Serbia is under the influences of the landmass of Eurasia and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]]. With mean January temperatures around {{convert|0|C|F}}, and mean July temperatures of {{convert|22|C|F}}, it can be classified as a [[humid continental climate|warm-humid continental]] or [[humid subtropical climate]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Atlas of the World'' (1993). Times Books {{ISBN|0-7230-0492-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, the climate is more continental, with cold winters, and hot, humid summers along with well-distributed rainfall patterns. In the south, summers and autumns are drier, and winters are relatively cold, with heavy inland snowfall in the mountains.
[[File:Stara planina14.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Landscapes in [[Balkan Mountains|Stara Planina Nature Park]].]]

Differences in elevation, proximity to the Adriatic Sea and large river basins, as well as exposure to the winds account for climate variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-92892/Serbia |title=Serbia :: Climate |year=2007 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |pages=5 of 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Serbia is subject to Mediterranean influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/serbia/ |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dinaric Alps and other mountain ranges contribute to the cooling of most of the warm air masses.

{{Main|Politics of Serbia}} 
Serbia is a [[parliamentary republic]], with the government divided into legislative, executive, and judiciary branches.
Serbia had one of the first modern constitutions in Europe, the 1835 Constitution (known as the [[Sretenje Constitution]]), which was at the time considered among the most progressive and liberal constitutions in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bastabalkana.com/2012/10/svi-ustavi-moderne-drzave-srbije-od-1835-do-2006-sretenjski-turski-radikalski-ustav-i-srpska-ustavnost/|title=Svi Ustavi moderne države Srbije od 1835 do 2006 – Sretenjski, Turski, Radikalski ustav i Srpska ustavnost|date=29 October 2012|website=Bašta Balkana Magazin|language=sr-RS|access-date=15 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalniforum.com/2017/02/15/sretenjski-ustav-iz-1835-kako-je-srbija-u-19-stoljecu-postala-drzava-slobode/|title=Sretenjski ustav iz 1835.: Kako je Srbija u 19. stoljeću postala "država slobode" – Liberalni Forum|language=bs-BA|access-date=15 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has adopted 10 different constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belgraded.com/serbian-constitutional-history-part-i |title=Serbian Constitutional History Part I |publisher=Belgraded.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316002931/https://www.belgraded.com/serbian-constitutional-history-part-i |archive-date=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current constitution was adopted in 2006 in the aftermath of [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|Montenegro independence referendum]] which by consequence renewed the independence of Serbia itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=7378 |title=Serbia: Constitution of The Republic of Serbia |publisher=Wipo.int }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Court of Serbia|Constitutional Court]] rules on matters regarding the [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]].

The Constitution of Serbia defines it as a [[secular state]] with guaranteed religious freedom. Orthodox Christians with 6,079,396 comprise 84.5% of country's population. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] is the largest and traditional church of the country, adherents of which are overwhelmingly Serbs. Other Orthodox Christian communities in Serbia include Montenegrins, Romanians, Vlachs, [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Bulgarians]].

In 2011, [[Roman Catholicism in Serbia|Roman Catholics]] numbered 356,957 in Serbia, or roughly 6% of the population, mostly in northern Vojvodina which is home to ethnic minority groups such as Hungarians, Croats, and [[Bunjevci]], as well as to some Slovaks and Czechs.&lt;ref name="popis2011.stat.rs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popis2011.stat.rs/?page_id=1221 |title=Становништво, домаћинства и породице – база : Попис у Србији 2011 |publisher=Popis2011.stat.rs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protestantism]] accounts for about 1% of the country's population, chiefly [[Lutheranism]] among [[Slovaks in Vojvodina]] as well as [[Calvinism]] among [[Hungarian Reformed Church|Reformed Hungarians]]. [[Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia and Montenegro|Greek Catholic Church]] is adhered by around 25,000 citizens (0.37% of the population), mostly [[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]] in Vojvodina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zumberacki-vikarijat.com/grkokatolici-u-vojvodini-istocni-dio-nekadasnje-grkokatolicke-slavonske-eparhije/|title=GRKOKATOLICI U VOJVODINI|publisher=Žumberacki Vikarijat|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslims]], with 222,282 or 3% of the population, form the third largest religious group. Islam has a strong historic following in the southern regions of Serbia, primarily in southern Raška. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest Islamic community in Serbia, followed by [[Albanians]]; estimates are that around a third of the country's Roma people are Muslim.

In 2011, there were only 578 [[Jews in Serbia]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; compared to over 30,000 prior to [[World War II]]. [[Atheists]] numbered 80,053, or 1.1% of the population, and an additional 4,070 declared themselves to be [[agnostic]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Knjiga4_Veroispovest.pdf |title=Municipality data |website=pod2.stat.gov.rs |publisher=PBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy sector is one of the largest and most important sectors to the country's economy. Serbia is a net exporter of electricity and importer of key fuels (such as oil and gas).

Serbia has an abundance of coal, and significant reserves of oil and gas. Serbia's proven reserves of 5.5 billion tonnes of [[lignite|coal lignite]] are the 5th largest in the world (second in Europe, after Germany).&lt;ref name="b92.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=507192 |title=Biz – Vesti – Srbija ima uglja za još jedan vek |publisher=B92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser_2010_report_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824071141/http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser_2010_report_1.pdf |archive-date=24 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is found in two large deposits: [[RB Kolubara|Kolubara]] (4 billion tonnes of reserves) and [[Kostolac coal mine|Kostolac]] (1.5 billion tonnes).&lt;ref name="b92.net"/&gt; Despite being small on a world scale, Serbia's oil and gas resources (77.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent and 48.1 billion cubic metres, respectively) have a certain regional importance since they are largest in the region of former Yugoslavia as well as the Balkans (excluding Romania).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309174844/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html |date=9 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 90% of the discovered oil and gas are to be found in [[Banat]] and those oil and gas fields are by size among the largest in the Pannonian basin but are average on a European scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogj.com/1/vol-110/issue-1a/exploration-development/exploration-production-full.html |title=Exploration, production pace faster in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina – Oil &amp; Gas Journal |publisher=Ogj.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:National Museum of Serbia (DSC04612).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[National Museum of Serbia]] houses a number of domestic and international masterpieces.]]
For centuries straddling the boundaries between East and West, the territory of Serbia had been divided among the Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]; then between [[Byzantium]] and the Kingdom of Hungary; and in the Early modern period between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. These overlapping influences have resulted in cultural varieties throughout Serbia; its north leans to the profile of Central Europe, while the south is characteristic of the wider Balkans and even the Mediterranean. The Byzantine influence on Serbia was profound, firstly through the introduction of [[Eastern Christianity]] in the Early Middle Ages. The Serbian Orthodox Church has had an enduring status in Serbia, with the [[List of Serb Orthodox monasteries|many Serbian monasteries]] constituting cultural monuments left from [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]]. Serbia has seen influences of [[Republic of Venice]] as well, mainly though trade, literature and [[Romanesque art|romanesque architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML-aXrrBrv8C&amp;q=Venetian+influences+on+Serbian+culture&amp;pg=PA1616|title=World and Its Peoples|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7903-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mihajlović |first=Radmila |date=2018|title=Following the traces of Serbs through Northern Italy |journal=Basis of Cultural Tourism Development|location=Rome|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbia has five cultural monuments inscribed in the list of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]]: the early medieval capital [[Stari Ras]] and the 13th-century monastery [[Sopoćani]]; the 12th-century [[Studenica monastery]]; the Roman complex of [[Gamzigrad|Gamzigrad–Felix Romuliana]]; medieval tombstones [[Stećci]]; and finally the endangered [[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]] (the monasteries of [[Visoki Dečani]], [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]], [[Gračanica Monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]]).{{sfn|Čanak-Medić|Todić|2017|p=}}

There are two literary monuments on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme]]: the 12th-century ''[[Miroslav Gospel]]'', and scientist [[Nikola Tesla]]'s archive.

Traces of Roman and early Byzantine Empire architectural heritage are found in many royal cities and palaces in Serbia, like [[Sirmium]], [[Gamzigrad|Felix Romuliana]] and [[Justiniana Prima]], since 535 the seat of the [[Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima]].{{sfn|Turlej|2016|p=193}}

Serbian monasteries are the pinnacle of Serbian medieval art. At the beginning, they were under the influence of [[Byzantine Art]] which was particularly felt after the fall of Constantinople in 1204, when many Byzantine artists fled to Serbia.&lt;ref name="The Royal Family of Serbia"&gt;{{cite web | title=Serbian art | website=The Royal Family of Serbia | url=https://royalfamily.org/about-serbia/serbian-art/ | access-date=2021-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted of these monasteries is [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]] (built around 1190). It was a model for later monasteries, like the [[Mileševa]], [[Sopoćani]], [[Žiča]], [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Visoki Dečani]]. Numerous monuments and cultural sites were destroyed at various stages of Serbian history, with [[Destruction of Serbian heritage in Kosovo|destruuction in Kosovo]] being the recent example. In the end of 14th and the 15th centuries, autochthonous architectural style known as [[Morava architectural school|Morava style]] evolved in area around Morava Valley. A characteristic of this style was the wealthy decoration of the frontal church walls. Examples of this include [[Manasija]], [[Ravanica]] and [[Kalenić Monastery|Kalenić]] monasteries. 

Icons and fresco paintings are often considered the peak of Serbian art. The most famous frescos are [[White Angel]] (Mileševa monastery), ''Crucifixion'' (Studenica monastery) and ''Dormition of the Virgin'' (Sopoćani).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs/~todorom/tutorials/rad43.html|title=Spirituality and Materiality on Serbian Frescoes |website=afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.rs|access-date=28 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of Ottoman occupation, Serbian art was virtually non-existent, with the exception of several Serbian artists who lived in the lands ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. 
Traditional Serbian art showed [[Baroque]] influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and [[Jakov Orfelin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/dmedakovic-art_xviii-xix.html |title=Art in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries |publisher=rastko.rs |access-date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Serbian literature}}
The beginning of Serbian literacy dates back to the activity of the brothers [[Cyril and Methodius]] in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web | title=History | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Serbia | access-date=2021-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monuments of Serbian literacy from the early 11th century can be found, written in [[Glagolitic]]. Starting in the 12th century, books were written in [[Cyrillic]]. From this epoch, the oldest Serbian Cyrillic book editorial are the [[Miroslav Gospels]] from 1186. ''The Miroslav Gospels'' are considered to be the oldest book of Serbian medieval history and as such has entered [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title= Miroslav Gospel – Manuscript from 1180 |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/miroslav-gospel-manuscript-from-1180/| date=19 January 2014 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |access-date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable medieval authors include [[Saint Sava]], [[Jefimija]], [[Stefan Lazarević]], [[Constantine of Kostenets]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/jderetic_knjiz/jderetic-knjiz_01.html#_Toc412462947 |title=Stara književnost |language=sr |publisher=rastko.rs |access-date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Ottoman occupation, when every aspect of formal literacy stopped, Serbia stayed excluded from the entire [[Renaissance]] flow in Western culture. However, the tradition of oral story-telling blossomed, shaping itself through [[epic poetry]] inspired by at the times still recent [[Kosovo battle]] and [[Folklore|folk tales]] deeply rooted in [[Slavic mythology]]. [[Serbian epic poetry]] in those times has seen as the most effective way in preserving the national identity.{{sfn|Dragnich|1994|p=29–30}}&lt;ref name="CaseNaimark2003"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Norman M.

Some of the best known folk ballads are ''The Death of the Mother of the Jugović Family'' and [[Hasanaginica|The Mourning Song of the Noble Wife of the Asan Aga]] (1646), translated into European languages by [[Goethe]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Pushkin]] and [[Mérimée]].

[[Balkan Brass Band|Balkan Brass]], or ''truba'' ("trumpet") is a popular genre, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass originated. The music has its tradition from the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. The trumpet was used as a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles, and it took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying births, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. There are two main varieties of this genre, one from Western Serbia and the other from Southern Serbia, with brass musician [[Boban Marković]] being one of the most respected names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panacomp.net/boban-and-marko-markovic-brass-band/|title=Boban and Marko Marković Brass Band -|date=25 January 2016|access-date=27 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Serbian cuisine}}
[[File:Christmas table (Serbian cuisine).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|A typical Serbian Christmas meal that includes roasted [[pork]], [[Russian salad]] and [[Serbian wine|red wine]].]]
[[File:Gibanica single slice with full pie in background.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|[[Gibanica]] is a traditional Serbian pastry dish that is usually made with [[cottage cheese]] and [[egg as food|eggs]], it is also considered as one of the [[national dish]]es of Serbia.]]
Serbian cuisine is largely heterogeneous in a way characteristic of the Balkans and, especially, the [[former Yugoslavia]]. It features foods characteristic of lands formerly under [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] suzerainty as well as cuisine originating from other parts of [[Central Europe]] (especially [[Austrian cuisine|Austria]] and [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungary]]). Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and feast days i.e. [[slava]].{{sfn|Meynink|2011|p=330}}

Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals. It plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and [[salt]] to guests. Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. The southern Serbian city of [[Leskovac]] is host to [[Roštiljijada]], a yearly grilled meat barbecue-based festival that is considered the biggest barbecue festival in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Xinhua 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Biggest meat feast opens in Serbian barbecue capital of Leskovac - English.news.cn | website=Xinhua | date=2017-03-21 | url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/29/c_136563246.htm | access-date=2021-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other Serbian specialties include [[ćevapčići]] (grilled and seasoned caseless sausages made from minced meat), [[pljeskavica]] (grilled spiced meat patty made from a mixture of pork, beef and lamb), [[gibanica]] (cheese pie), [[burek]] (baked pastry made from a thin flaky dough that is stuffed with meat, cheese or vegetables), [[sarma (food)|sarma]] (stuffed cabbage), [[punjena paprika]] (stuffed pepper), [[moussaka]] (casserole made from minced meat, eggs, and potatoes), [[Karađorđeva šnicla]] (veal or pork [[schnitzel]] that is stuffed with kajmak), [[đuveč]] (meat and vegetable stew), [[pasulj]] (bean soup), [[podvarak]] (roast meat with sauerkraut), [[ajvar]] (roasted red pepper spread), [[kajmak]] (dairy product similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[čvarci]] (variant of [[pork rinds]]), [[proja]] (cornbread) and [[kačamak]] (corn-flour porridge).{{sfn|Meynink|2011|p=329–330}}

Serbians claim their country as the birthplace of [[rakia]] (''rakija''), a highly alcoholic drink primarily distilled from fruit. Rakia in various forms is found throughout the Balkans, notably in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Hungary and Turkey. [[Slivovitz]] (''šljivovica''), a plum brandy, is a type of rakia which is considered the [[national drink]] of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serbia.travel/about-serbia/typically-serbian/food/ |title=Food |publisher=serbia.travel |access-date=20 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420144616/https://www.serbia.travel/about-serbia/typically-serbian/food/ |archive-date=20 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|Sport in Serbia}}
Sports play an important role in Serbian society, and the country has a strong sporting history. The most popular sports in Serbia are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], [[water polo]] and [[handball]].

[[File:Novak Djokovic Queen's Club 2018.jpg|upright=1.0|thumb|right|[[Novak Djokovic]], considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time]]
Professional sports in Serbia are organised by sporting federations and leagues (in the case of team sports). One of the particularities of Serbian professional sports is the existence of many multi-sport clubs (called "sports societies"), the biggest and most successful of which are [[SD Crvena Zvezda|Red Star]], [[JSD Partizan|Partizan]], and [[OSD Beograd|Beograd]] in Belgrade; [[SD Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] in Novi Sad; [[FK Radnički 1923|Radnički]] in Kragujevac; and [[FK Spartak Zlatibor Voda|Spartak]] in Subotica.

Football is the most popular sport in Serbia, and the [[Football Association of Serbia]] with 146,845 registered players, is the largest sporting association in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fss.rs/index.php?id=3011|title=Football Association of Serbia – Official Web Site|access-date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FK Bačka 1901]] is the oldest football club in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subotica.com/vesti/fk-backa-1901-slavi-115-godina-postojanja-id25895.html|title=FK "Bačka 1901" slavi 115 godina postojanja|website=SUBOTICA.com – najposećeniji subotički sajt|language=SR|access-date=1 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dragan Džajić]] was officially recognised as "the best Serbian player of all time" by the Football Association of Serbia, and more recently the likes of [[Nemanja Vidić]], [[Dejan Stanković]], [[Branislav Ivanović]], [[Aleksandar Kolarov]] and [[Nemanja Matić]] play for the elite European clubs, developing the nation's reputation as one of the world's biggest exporters of footballers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccerlens.com/serbias-endless-list-of-wonder-kids/39911/] Soccerlens – 27 January 2010 – Serbia's Endless List of Wonderkids&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Poli|last2=Loïc|last3=Roger|first1=Raffaele|first2=Ravenel|first3=Besson|date=October 2015|title=Exporting countries in world football|url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/mr08_eng.pdf|journal=CIES Football Observatory Monthly Report|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Serbia national football team]] lacks relative success although it qualified for three of the last four [[FIFA World Cup]]s.
