'''Martin Luther King Jr.''' (born '''Michael King Jr.'''; January 15, 1929&amp;nbsp;– April 4, 1968) was an American [[Baptist]] minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the American [[civil rights movement]] from 1955 until [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|his assassination]] in 1968. King advanced [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]], inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He was the son of early civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Sr.]]

King participated in and led marches for blacks' right to [[Voting|vote]], [[desegregation]], [[labor rights]], and other basic civil rights.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=53}} King led the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and later became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful [[Albany Movement]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. King helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington]], where he delivered his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]].

The SCLC put into practice the tactics of [[nonviolent]] protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|p=190}} FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963, forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his [[extramarital affairs]] and reported on them to government officials, and, in 1964, mailed King [[FBI–King suicide letter|a threatening anonymous letter]], which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

On October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]]. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], [[capitalism]], and the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of [[Washington, D.C.]], to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories|Allegations]] that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting. King was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1977 and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 2003. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and [[King County, Washington|the most populous county]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] was rededicated for him. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.

===Early childhood===
[[File:Martin Luther King's Boyhood Home.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|King's childhood home in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]]]
At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the [[Bible]] as instructed by their father.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=5}} After dinners there, King's grandmother Jennie, who he affectionately referred to as "Mama", would tell lively stories from the Bible to her grandchildren.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=5}} King's father would regularly use [[whipping]]s to discipline his children.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=8}} At times, King Sr. would also have his children whip each other.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=8}} King's father later remarked, "[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He'd stand there, and the tears would run down, and he'd never cry."{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=14}} Once when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=8}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=15}} When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a [[banister]] and hit into their grandmother, Jennie, causing her to fall down unresponsive.{{sfn|Oates|1983|pp=8–9}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=15}} King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted [[suicide]] by jumping from a second-story window.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=9}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=15}} Upon hearing that his grandmother was alive, King rose and left the ground where he had fallen.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=9}}

King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his family's home.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}} In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. |first=Alan |last=Pierce |url=https://archive.org/details/assassinationofm0000pier |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/assassinationofm0000pier/page/14 14] |year=2004 |publisher=Abdo Pub Co |isbn=978-1-59197-727-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; King had to attend a school for black children, Younge Street Elementary School,{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=13}} while his close playmate went to a separate school for white children only.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=13}} Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him "we are white, and you are colored".{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=4}} When King relayed the happenings to his parents, they had a long discussion with him about the history of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Racism in the United States|racism in America]].{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=14}} Upon learning of the hatred, violence and oppression that black people had faced in the U.S., King would later state that he was "determined to hate every white person".{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=10}} His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=14}}

King witnessed his father stand up against [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and various forms of [[Discrimination based on skin color|discrimination]].{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=15}} Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as "boy", King's father responded sharply that King was a boy but he was a man.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=15}} When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back.{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=9}} King's father refused, stating "we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all", before taking King and leaving the store.{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=10}} He told King afterward, "I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it."{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=10}} In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African Americans in a [[civil rights]] march to the [[city hall]] in Atlanta, to protest [[voting rights]] discrimination.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=8}} King later remarked that King Sr. was "a real father" to him.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=12}}

King memorized and sang [[hymns]], and stated verses from the [[Bible]], by the time he was five years old.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=9}} Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=9}} His favorite hymn to sing was ''"I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus"''; he moved attendees with his singing.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=9}} King later became a member of the junior choir in his church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: Young Man with a Dream|first=Dharathula H.|last=Millender|pages=[https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking00mill_0/page/45 45–46]|year=1986|isbn=978-0-02-042010-1|publisher=Aladdin|url=https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking00mill_0/page/45}}&lt;/ref&gt; King enjoyed [[opera]], and played the [[piano]].{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=13}} As he grew up, King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries and consistently used his expanding lexicon.{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=15}} He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stymie fights.{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=15}}{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=13}} King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait which he carried throughout his life.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=13}} In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in [[slave]] costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref name="katznelson"&gt;{{cite book| last=Katznelson| first=Ira| page=[https://archive.org/details/whenaffirmativea00katz/page/5 5]| title=When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America| isbn=0-393-05213-3| year=2005| publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co| url=https://archive.org/details/whenaffirmativea00katz/page/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=11}} In September 1940, at the age of 12, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the [[seventh grade]].{{sfn|Boyd|1996|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=King enters seventh grade at Atlanta University Laboratory School |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/king-enters-seventh-grade-atlanta-university-laboratory-school |website=The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=17 September 2020 |language=en |date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in his history and English classes.{{sfn|Boyd|1996|p=23}}

On May 18, 1941, when King had snuck away from studying at home to watch a parade, King was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=12}} Upon returning home, he found out that she had suffered a [[heart attack]] and died while being transported to a [[hospital]].{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=13}} He took the death very hard and believed that his deception of going to see the parade may have been responsible for [[God]] taking her.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=13}} King jumped out of a second-story window at his home, but again survived an attempt to kill himself.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=13}}{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=14}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=15}} His father instructed him in his bedroom that King should not blame himself for her death, and that she had been called home to God as part of God's plan which could not be changed.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=13}}{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=16}} King struggled with this, and could not fully believe that his parents knew where his grandmother had gone.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=13}} Shortly thereafter, King's father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill that overlooked downtown Atlanta.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=13}}
[[File:Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta.jpg|alt=|thumb|The high school that King attended was named after African-American educator [[Booker T. Washington]].]]

===Adolescence===
In his adolescent years, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the "racial humiliation" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure in the segregated South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=John|title=How MLK became an angry black man |date=April 16, 2013 |work=[[CNN]] |url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/us/king-birmingham-jail-letter-anniversary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, when King was 13 years old, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.{{sfn|King|1992|p=82}} That year, King skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in [[Washington High School (Atlanta)|Booker T.

===Morehouse College===
During King's junior year in high school, [[Morehouse College]]—an all-male [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]] which King's father and maternal grandfather had attended{{sfn|Manhiemer|2005|p=19}}{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=10}}—began accepting high school juniors who passed the school's [[entrance examination]].{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=16}}{{sfn|Schuman|2014|loc=chpt. 2}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=9}} As [[World War II]] was underway many black college students had been enlisted in the war, decreasing the numbers of students at Morehouse College.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=16}}{{sfn|Schuman|2014|loc=chpt. 2}} So, the university aimed to increase their student numbers by allowing junior high school students to apply.{{sfn|Oates|1983|p=16}}{{sfn|Schuman|2014|loc=chpt. 2}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=9}} In 1944, at the age of 15, King passed the entrance examination and was enrolled at the university for the school season that autumn.{{efn|There is some disagreement in sources regarding precisely when King took and passed the entrance exam in 1944.

Manheimer (2005) states that King graduated from the eleventh grade, then applied and took the entrance exam before going to Connecticut, but did not find out he had passed until August of 1944 when he was admitted.

After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit any where we want to."&lt;ref name="jc"/&gt; The students worked at the farm to be able to provide for their educational costs at Morehouse College, as the farm had partnered with the college to allot their [[salaries]] towards the university's [[tuition]], housing, and other fees.&lt;ref name="tewa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ctnbc"/&gt; On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00am till at least 5:00pm, enduring temperatures above 100[[Fahrenheit|°F]], to earn roughly [[USD]]$4 per day.&lt;ref name="ctnbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christoffersen |first1=John |title=MLK Was Inspired by Time in Connecticut |url=https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/mlk-was-inspired-by-time-in-connecticut/1885278/ |access-date=18 October 2020 |work=NBC Connecticut |date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday evenings, King and the other students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to see [[theatre]] performances, shop and eat in restaurants.&lt;ref name="ctnbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mk"/&gt; While each Sunday they would go to Hartford to attend church services, at a church filled with white congregants.&lt;ref name="ctnbc"/&gt; King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation in Connecticut, relaying how he was amazed they could go to the "one of the finest restaurants in Hartford" and that "Negroes and whites go to the same church".&lt;ref name="ctnbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brindley"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brindley |first1=Emily |title=Martin Luther King Jr.'s time in Connecticut was pivotal, but has never been thoroughly documented; that's about to change |url=https://www.courant.com/community/simsbury/hc-news-simsbury-martin-luther-king-jr-tobacco-20191113-mcp3mzoevbf37io2yixwp4fojq-story.html |access-date=19 October 2020 |work=courant.com |date=13 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jc"/&gt;

He played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the [[Christian ministry|ministry]]. Throughout his time in college, King studied under the mentorship of its president, [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister [[Benjamin Mays]], who he would later credit with being his "spiritual mentor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kelly|first=Jason|date=January 1, 2013|title=Benjamin Mays found a voice for civil rights|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/features/benjamin_mays/|access-date=June 6, 2020|website=The University of Chicago|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer "an inner urge to serve humanity." His "inner urge" had begun developing, and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a "rational" minister with sermons that were "a respectful force for ideas, even social protest."{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=18}} King graduated from Morehouse with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in [[sociology]] in 1948, aged nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVgKAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=MLK+BA+sociology&amp;pg=PA889|title=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-94704-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they had shared responsibility as African Americans to bear "the burdens of the Negro race." For a time, he was interested in [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]'s "social gospel."{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=20–22}} In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked as a cook in the cafeteria. The woman had been involved with a professor prior to her relationship with King. King planned to marry her, but friends advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. He continued to have lingering feelings toward the woman he left; one friend was quoted as saying, "He never recovered."{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=20–22}} King graduated with a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.Div.]] degree in 1951.&lt;ref name="mercer"/&gt;

===Marriage and family===
While studying at Boston University, he asked a friend from Atlanta named Mary Powell, who was a student at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]], if she knew any nice Southern girls. Powell asked fellow student Coretta Scott if she was interested in meeting a Southern friend studying divinity. Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow Martin to telephone her based on Powell's description and vouching. On their first phone call, King told Scott "I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms," to which she replied, "You haven't even met me." They went out for dates in his green Chevy. After the second date, King was certain Scott possessed the qualities he sought in a wife. She had been an activist at Antioch in undergrad, where Carol and Rod Serling were schoolmates.

King married [[Coretta Scott King|Coretta Scott]] on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of [[Heiberger, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Nixon]] and [[Clifford Durr]] decided to wait for a better case to pursue because the incident involved a minor.{{sfn|Manheimer|2004|p=103}}

Nine months later on December 1, 1955, a similar incident occurred when [[Rosa Parks]] was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=December 1, 1955: Rosa Parks arrested |date=March 11, 2003 |work=CNN |access-date=June 8, 2008 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/10/sprj.80.1955.parks/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Nixon and led by King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Montgomery Bus Boycott|page=[https://archive.org/details/montgomerybusboy0000wals/page/24 24]|last=Walsh|first=Frank|publisher=Gareth Stevens|year= 2003|isbn= 0-8368-5375-X|url=https://archive.org/details/montgomerybusboy0000wals/page/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was in his twenties, and had just taken up his clerical role. The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role simply because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant about taking the role, but decided to do so if no one else wanted the role.&lt;ref name="Prize 1"&gt;Interview with Coretta Scott King, Episode 1, PBS tv series [[Eyes on the Prize]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The boycott lasted for 385 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bA1azdRdD18C&amp;pg=PA25 |title=Ethical Leadership Through Transforming Justice| last=McMahon|first=Thomas F.|page=25|isbn=0-7618-2908-3|publisher=University Press of America |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patterns of Conflict, Paths to Peace|last1=Fisk|first1=Larry J.|page=[https://archive.org/details/patternsofconfli0000unse/page/115 115]|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=1-55111-154-3|first2=John|last2=Schellenberg|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/patternsofconfli0000unse/page/115}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was arrested and jailed during this campaign, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King's public stature. The controversy ended when the United States District Court issued a ruling in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that prohibited racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses.{{sfn|King|1992|p=9}} Blacks resumed riding the buses again, and were able to sit in the front with full legal authorization.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=53}}&lt;ref name="Prize 1"/&gt;

King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=52}}

===Southern Christian Leadership Conference===

In 1957, King, [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], [[Joseph Lowery]], and other civil rights activists founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The group was created to harness the [[moral authority]] and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist [[Billy Graham]], who befriended King,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/billygrahamriseo0000mill/page/92|title=Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South|page=[https://archive.org/details/billygrahamriseo0000mill/page/92 92]|first=Steven P.|last=Miller|year=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-4151-8|access-date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies [[Stanley Levison]] and [[Ella Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/levison-stanley-david|title=Levison, Stanley David|date=May 17, 2017|website=The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|language=en|access-date=January 30, 2020|last3=California 94305}}&lt;/ref&gt; King led the SCLC until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal: an African American Anthology|url=https://archive.org/details/letnobodyturnusa00mann|url-access=registration|last1= Marable| first1= Manning | first2=Leith|last2=Mullings|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-8476-8346-X|year=2000|pages=[https://archive.org/details/letnobodyturnusa00mann/page/391 391–92]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCLC's 1957 [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]] was the first time King addressed a national audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom|url=http://crdl.usg.edu/events/prayer_pilgrimage/?Welcome|publisher=Civil Rights Digital Library|access-date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: [[James Bevel]], [[Allen Johnson (activist)|Allen Johnson]], [[Curtis W.

==== The Common Society ====

[[Harry H. Wachtel|Harry Wachtel]] joined King's legal advisor [[Clarence B. Jones]] in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]''; the case was litigated in reference to the newspaper advertisement "[[Heed Their Rising Voices]]". Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit's expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. This organization was named the "Gandhi Society for Human Rights." King served as honorary president for the group. He was displeased with the pace that President Kennedy was using to address the issue of segregation. In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on the President to follow in the footsteps of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of [[Second Emancipation Proclamation]]. Kennedy did not execute the order.&lt;ref name="Stanford University"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/gandhi-society-human-rights|title=Martin Luther King Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle: Gandhi Society for Human Rights|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was under written directive from Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] when it began [[telephone tapping|tapping]] King's telephone line in the fall of 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide|last1=Theoharis|first1=Athan G.|first2=Tony G.|last2=Poveda|first3=Richard Gid|last3=Powers|first4=Susan|last4=Rosenfeld|page=[https://archive.org/details/fbicomprehensive0000theo/page/148 148]|isbn=0-89774-991-X|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/fbicomprehensive0000theo/page/148}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.{{sfn|Herst|2007|pp=372–74}} FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position in the [[COINTELPRO]] program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide|last1=Theoharis|first1=Athan G.|first2=Tony G.|last2=Poveda|first3=Richard Gid|last3=Powers|first4=Susan|last4=Rosenfeld|page=[https://archive.org/details/fbicomprehensive0000theo/page/123 123]|isbn=0-89774-991-X|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/fbicomprehensive0000theo/page/123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as [[Jim Crow laws]] would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race and Labor Matters in the New U.S. Economy|last1=Wilson|first1=Joseph|first2=Manning|last2=Marable|first3=Immanuel|last3=Ness|page=[https://archive.org/details/racelabormatters0000unse/page/47 47]|isbn=0-7425-4691-8|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|url=https://archive.org/details/racelabormatters0000unse/page/47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Architects of Political Change: Constitutional Quandaries and Social Choice Theory|last= Schofield|first= Norman|isbn= 0-521-83202-0|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2006|page= [https://archive.org/details/architectsofpoli00norm/page/189 189]|url= https://archive.org/details/architectsofpoli00norm/page/189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King organized and led marches for blacks' right to [[Voting|vote]], [[desegregation]], [[labor rights]], and other basic civil rights.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=53}} Most of these rights were successfully enacted into the [[law of the United States]] with the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= International Encyclopedia of Public Policy and Administration|last=Shafritz|first= Jay M.|page= 1242|year= 1998| isbn=0-8133-9974-2| publisher= Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Civil Rights Act of 1964: The Passage of the Law that Ended Racial Segregation| last1=Loevy | first1=Robert D.|first2=Hubert H.|last2=Humphrey|first3=John G.|last3=Stewart|isbn= 0-7914-3361-7 |publisher=SUNY Press|year= 1997| page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|p=190}}

===Survived knife attack, 1958===

On September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'' in Blumstein's department store in Harlem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=Hugh |year=2002 |title=When Harlem Nearly Killed King: The 1958 Stabbing of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. |publisher=Seven Stories Press |page=37 |isbn=978-1-58322-614-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVQUJHo55IC&amp;pg=PA37}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he narrowly escaped death. [[Izola Curry]]—a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Michael |title=Before 'I (We)Have a Dream,' Martin Luther King Almost Died.

===Atlanta sit-ins, prison sentence, and the 1960 elections===

Georgia governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] expressed open hostility towards King's return to his hometown in late 1959. He claimed that "wherever M. L. King, Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes", and vowed to keep King under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Samuel Vandiver, in the MLK Encyclopedia |date=July 6, 2017 |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/vandiver-samuel-ernest-jr |access-date=14 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 1960, several months after his return, King drove writer [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]] to [[Emory University]] when police stopped them. King was cited for "driving without a license" because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King's Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Traffic stop 60 years ago spurred Martin Luther King Jr. into greater action |url=https://romesentinel.com/stories/traffic-stop-60-years-ago-spurred-martin-luther-king-jr-into-greater-action,97644? |agency=The Rome Sentinel |date=May 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; King paid a fine but was apparently unaware that his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that also included a probationary sentence.

Meanwhile, the [[Atlanta Student Movement]] had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces in the city, organizing the [[Atlanta sit-ins]] from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how [[1960 United States presidential election|1960's Presidential election campaign]] had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]], Atlanta's largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was taken from his county jail cell and transported to a maximum-security state prison.{{where|date=June 2021}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Negro Integration Leader Sentenced to Four Months |url=https://accesswdun.com/article/2020/5/900021 |agency=Associated Press |date=October 25, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King's safety, as he started a prison sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many of them White and hostile to his activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levingston |first1=Steven |title=John F.

Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship prior to the sit-in, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from [[Jackie Robinson]] requesting his intervention. Nixon's opponent [[John F. Kennedy]] called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] to exert more pressure on state authorities, and also, at the personal request of [[Sargent Shriver]], made a phone call to King's wife to express his sympathy and offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King's father decided to openly endorse Kennedy's candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Martin Luther Jr. |title=The Autobiography Of Martin Luther King, Jr. |publisher=Hatchette |chapter=Chapter 15: Atlanta Arrest and Presidential Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed in full swing for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city's lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Photos: How Atlanta Public Schools integrated in 1961 |url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/photos-how-atlanta-public-schools-integrated-1961/c4isBuwZmZxJsdU2u9FBpJ/ |agency=Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Rebecca |title=The integration of Atlanta Public Schools |url=https://www.atlantamagazine.com/civilrights/the-integration-of-atlanta-public-schools/ |agency=Atlanta Magazine |date=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated towards the elders and the compromise. King then gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the "cancerous disease of disunity," and helping to calm tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hatfield |first1=Edward A. |title=Atlanta Sit-ins |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/atlanta-sit-ins |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albany Movement, 1961===
{{Main|Albany Movement}}
The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in [[Albany, Georgia]], in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a broad-front nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation within the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he "had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel."&lt;ref name=Hatchette&gt;{{cite book |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pynSnGuC964C&amp;pg=PT147 |title=The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr. |publisher=Hatchette Digital |year=2001 |page=147 |isbn=978-0-7595-2037-0 |access-date=January 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day he was swept up in a [[mass arrest]] of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, "that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city" after he left town.&lt;ref name=Hatchette /&gt;

King returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine ({{Inflation|US|178|1962|r=-2|fmt=eq}}); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. "We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools&amp;nbsp;... ejected from churches&amp;nbsp;... and thrown into jail&amp;nbsp;... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. |last=King |first=Martin Luther Jr. |year=1990 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-06-064691-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/testamentofhope00mart/page/105 105] |url=https://archive.org/details/testamentofhope00mart/page/105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later acknowledged by the King Center that [[Billy Graham]] was the one who bailed King out of jail during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/theme/2179 King Center:Billy Graham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315074536/http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/theme/2179 |date=March 15, 2015 }} Accessed September 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a "Day of Penance" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|pp=190–93}} Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany| title= Albany, GA Movement|publisher= Civil Rights Movement Archive | access-date=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=96}}

===Birmingham campaign, 1963===
{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}
[[File:MLK mugshot birmingham.jpg|thumb|King was arrested in 1963 for protesting the treatment of blacks in Birmingham.]]
In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by [[Wyatt Tee Walker]]. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and [[sit-in]]s, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.

King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and "create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation."{{sfn|Garrow|1986|pp=246}} The campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist [[James Bevel]] changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join in the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="McWhorter 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=McWhorter|first=Diane|title=Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution|year=2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-2648-6|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743217729|url-access=registration|chapter=Two Mayors and a King}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' called this strategy a [[Children's Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Harrell 2005 1055"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unto a Good Land: A History of the American People, Volume 2|page=1055|first2=Edwin S.|last2=Gaustad|first3=Randall M.|last3=Miller|first4=John B.|last4=Boles|first5=Randall Bennett|last5=Woods|first6=Sally Foreman|last6=Griffith|last1=Harrell|first1=David Edwin|isbn= 0-8028-2945-7 |publisher=Wm B Eerdmans Publishing|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek5-13"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birmingham USA: Look at Them Run|journal=[[Newsweek]]|date=May 13, 1963|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protests, the Birmingham Police Department, led by [[Eugene "Bull" Connor]], used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news and dominated the nation's attention, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=113–14}} Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the "Jim Crow" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks.

King, representing the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], was among the leaders of the "[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were [[Roy Wilkins]] from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]; [[Whitney Young]], [[National Urban League]]; [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]; [[John Lewis]], [[SNCC]]; and [[James L.

[[Bayard Rustin]]'s open homosexuality, support of [[socialism]], and his former ties to the [[Communist Party USA]] caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/freedomriders1960000arse |url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/freedomriders1960000arse/page/62 62] | last=Arsenault|first=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice|isbn= 0-19-513674-8| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which King agreed to do.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=42}} However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary logistical and strategic organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages= [https://archive.org/details/leadersfrom1960s0000unse/page/138 138]–43|first= David|last= De Leon|title= Leaders from the 1960s: A biographical sourcebook of American activism|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn= 0-313-27414-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/leadersfrom1960s0000unse|url-access= registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= African-Americans and the Quest for Civil Rights, 1900–1990| url= https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00cash| url-access= registration| last= Cashman| first= Sean Dennis| page=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00cash/page/162 162] | isbn=0-8147-1441-2|publisher=NYU Press|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of [[John F.

Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights legislation]]. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes| last1= Rosenberg| first1= Jonathan| first2= Zachary| last2= Karabell| page= [https://archive.org/details/kennedyjohnsonth00rose/page/130 130]| isbn= 0-393-05122-6| year= 2003| publisher= WW Norton &amp; Co| url= https://archive.org/details/kennedyjohnsonth00rose/page/130}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000.

The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.&lt;ref name=farce&gt;{{cite book | title=Living for Change: An Autobiography| url=https://archive.org/details/livingforchangea00bogg| url-access=limited|last=Boggs|first=Grace Lee|page= [https://archive.org/details/livingforchangea00bogg/page/n145 127]|publisher= U of Minnesota Press|year= 1998 | isbn=0-8166-2955-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the "Farce on Washington", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending the march.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Mysteries in History: From Prehistory to the Present| last=Aron| first=Paul| pages=398–99 |isbn=1-85109-899-2|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82zu_Aw5VFgC&amp;pg=PA398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.}}

"I Have a Dream" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream Assignment |work=Smithsonian |date=August 1, 2003 |access-date=August 27, 2008 |last=Moore |first=Lucinda |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dream-speech.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105000547/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dream-speech.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers in the United States and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;James T.

In March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling's then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida.

In December 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], Alabama, where the SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Haley|first= Alex|title= Martin Luther King|work= Interview|author-link= Alex Haley|publisher= [[Playboy]]|date= January 1965|url= http://www.alex-haley.com/alex_haley_martin_luther_king_interview.htm|access-date= June 10, 2012|archive-date = May 5, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120505054207/http://www.alex-haley.com/alex_haley_martin_luther_king_interview.htm|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]] on January 2, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964selmainj |title=The Selma Injunction |publisher=Civil Rights Movement Archive |access-date=September 8, 2008 |archive-date=December 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225052448/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64c.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1965 march to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.

Acting on [[James Bevel]]'s call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]] and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel's nonviolence strategy.{{sfn|King|1998|p=6}}

On March 5, King met with officials in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] in order to request an [[injunction]] against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, "If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line."{{sfn|King|1998|pp=276–79}} Footage of [[police brutality]] against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=222–23}}

King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=223}} Meanwhile, on March 11 King cried at the news of Johnson supporting a voting rights bill on television in [[Marie Foster]]'s living room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2003-09-12|title=Marie Foster, Early Fighter For Voting Rights, Dies at 85|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/us/marie-foster-early-fighter-for-voting-rights-dies-at-85.html|access-date=2020-09-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Isserman|first1= Maurice|title= America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s|first2= Michael|last2= Kazin|page= [https://archive.org/details/americadividedci0000isse/page/175 175]|publisher= Oxford University Pressk|year= 2000|isbn= 0-19-509190-6|url= https://archive.org/details/americadividedci0000isse/page/175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Riotmakers|last=Azbell|first=Joe|publisher= Oak Tree Books|year= 1968|page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol|state capitol]], King delivered a speech that became known as "[[How Long, Not Long]]."

In 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North, with [[Chicago]] as their first destination. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S.

The SCLC formed a coalition with CCCO, Coordinating Council of Community Organizations, an organization founded by [[Albert Raby]], and the combined organizations' efforts were fostered under the aegis of the [[Chicago Freedom Movement]].&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;{{cite book| last=Ralph| first=James| isbn=0-674-62687-7| publisher=Harvard University Press| year=1993| title=Northern Protest: Martin Luther King Jr., Chicago, and the Civil Rights Movement| page=[https://archive.org/details/northernprotestm00ralp/page/1 1]| url=https://archive.org/details/northernprotestm00ralp/page/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Correspondence with Thích Nhất Hạnh ====
[[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] was an influential [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who taught at [[Princeton University]] and [[Columbia University]]. He had written a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 entitled: "In Search of the Enemy of Man". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavw.org/protest/king_journey_abstract09.html|title=Searching for the Enemy of Man" in Nhat Nanh, Ho Huu Tuong, Tam Ich, Bui Giang, Pham Cong Thien|date=1965|work=Dialogue|publisher=Saigon: La Boi|pages=11–20|access-date=September 13, 2010}}, Archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, King gave a famous speech at the [[Riverside Church]] in New York City, his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html|title=Beyond Vietnam |first=Martin Luther Jr. |last=King |location=Riverside Church, NYC|date=April 4, 1967|publisher=Archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website|access-date=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the 1967 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In his nomination, King said, "I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to [[ecumenism]], to world brotherhood, to humanity".&lt;ref name="nomination"&gt;{{cite letter|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/025.html|subject=Nomination of Thich Nhat Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize |first=Martin Luther Jr. |last=King |recipient=The Nobel Institute |date=January 25, 1967 |access-date=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor People's Campaign, 1968===

[[File:Resurrection City Washington D.C. 1968.jpg|alt=Rows of tents|thumb|A shantytown established in Washington, D. C. to protest economic conditions as a part of the [[Poor People's Campaign]]]]

In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the "[[Poor People's Campaign]]" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent [[civil disobedience]] at the Capitol until Congress created an "economic bill of rights" for poor Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Ernesto B.|last=Vigil|title=The Crusade for Justice: Chicano Militancy and the Government's War on Dissent|page= 54| publisher =University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-16224-9|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lied&gt;{{cite book|last= Kick|first= Russell |page=[https://archive.org/details/You_Are_Being_Lied_To_-_The_Disinformation_Guide_to_Media_Distortion_Historical_/page/1991 1991]|isbn=0-9664100-7-6 |publisher=The Disinformation Campaign|year=2001|title=You are Being Lied to: The Disinformation Guide to Media Distortion, Historical Whitewashes and Cultural Myths|url=https://archive.org/details/You_Are_Being_Lied_To_-_The_Disinformation_Guide_to_Media_Distortion_Historical_/page/1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was preceded by King's final book, ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from [[Henry George]] and George's book, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', particularly in support of a [[basic income|guaranteed basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Dan|title=Where Was Martin Luther King Heading?|url=http://savingcommunities.org/issues/race/king.martin.html|website=savingcommunities.org|access-date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Luther King&amp;nbsp;– Final Advice |url=http://www.progress.org/tpr/martin-luther-king-final-advice/ |date=January 9, 2007 |website=The Progress Report |access-date=February 4, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204201039/https://www.progress.org/tpr/martin-luther-king-final-advice/ |archive-date=February 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|title=Martin Luther King's Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/08/28/martin_luther_king_guaranteed_basic_income.html|access-date=January 20, 2015|agency=Slate|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the United States.

King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America's cities. He felt that Congress had shown "hostility to the poor" by spending "military funds with alacrity and generosity." He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided "poverty funds with miserliness."&lt;ref name=lied/&gt; His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of "racism, poverty, militarism and materialism", and argued that "reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced."{{sfn|Lawson|Payne|Patterson|2006|pp=148–49}}

The Poor People's Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington|url=https://archive.org/details/otheramericanlif0000isse|url-access=registration|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|page=[https://archive.org/details/otheramericanlif0000isse/page/281 281]|isbn=1-58648-036-7|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.

King was booked in Room 306 at the [[Lorraine Motel]] (owned by Walter Bailey) in Memphis.

&lt;/ref&gt; They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery.&lt;ref name=mlkassassin /&gt; In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. Jerry Ray said that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," Jerry said. "He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing."&lt;ref name=mlkassassin /&gt;

Those suspecting a conspiracy in the assassination point to the two successive [[ballistics]] tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray's [[Remington Arms|Remington]] Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray's specific rifle.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-WEB1&gt;{{cite news|title=Questions left hanging by James Earl Ray's death|publisher=BBC |date=April 23, 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/82893.stm|access-date=August 27, 2008}}

In 1997, King's son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a [[new trial]].&lt;ref name=CNN2&gt;{{cite news|title=James Earl Ray, convicted King assassin, dies|publisher=CNN|date=April 23, 1998|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9804/23/ray.obit/#2|access-date=September 17, 2006}}

Two years later, King's widow Coretta Scott King and the couple's children won a [[wrongful death claim]] against [[Loyd Jowers]] and "other unknown co-conspirators." Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination. The jury of six whites and six blacks found in favor of the King family, finding Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy against King and that government agencies were party to the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial Transcript Volume XIV|publisher=The King Center|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/tkc/trial/Volume14.html|access-date=August 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506041106/http://www.thekingcenter.org/tkc/trial/Volume14.html|archive-date=May 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/10/us/dr-king-s-slaying-finally-draws-a-jury-verdict-but-to-little-effect.html |title=Dr. King's Slaying Finally Draws A Jury Verdict, but to Little Effect |author1=Sack, Kevin |author2=Yellin, Emily |date=December 10, 1999 |work=The New York Times |access-date=January 20, 2013 |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126032638/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/10/us/dr-king-s-slaying-finally-draws-a-jury-verdict-but-to-little-effect.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

In 2000, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] completed the investigation into Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented.&lt;ref name="usdoj2"&gt;{{cite book| title=United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr|chapter=Overview|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Justice]]|date=June 2000|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part1.php|chapter-url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part2.php#over|access-date=July 11, 2011 |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113154920/http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part2.php |url-status=dead}}

In 2002, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson—not James Earl Ray—assassinated King. He stated, "It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way." Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims.&lt;ref name=NYTORIG&gt;{{cite news|title=A Minister Says His Father, Now Dead, Killed Dr. King|work=The New York Times|date=April 5, 2002| first=Dana|last=Canedy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/us/a-minister-says-his-father-now-dead-killed-dr-king.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King researchers [[David Garrow]] and [[Gerald Posner]] disagreed with William F.

King's widow Coretta publicly said that she believed her husband would have supported [[gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Triple Evils|publisher= [[The King Center]]| url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/misc/triple_evils.htm| archive-url=https://archive.today/20080803150448/http://www.thekingcenter.org/misc/triple_evils.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=August 3, 2008| access-date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said publicly that he would have been opposed to [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref name=MPR-WEB1&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first= Brandt|title= What would Martin Luther King do?|publisher= [[Minnesota Public Radio]]| date=January 16, 2005 | url= http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/01/17_williamsb_wwmlkd/| access-date=August 27, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 1968, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, in speaking about how he wished to be remembered after his death, King stated:

{{quote|I'd like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I'd like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.

I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.

Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won't have any money to leave behind. I won't have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind.

Beginning in 1971, cities such as [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and states established annual holidays to honor King.&lt;ref name="stlouis"&gt;[http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-remains-stronghold-dr-kings-dream Joseph Leahy, "St. Louis Remains A Stronghold For Dr. King's Dream"], ''News for St. Louis'', St. Louis Public Radio, January 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[White House]] Rose Garden on November 2, 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King. Observed for the first time on January 20, 1986, it is called [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]]. Following President [[George H. W.

===Christianity===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|King at the 1963 Civil Rights March in Washington, D.C.]]

As a Christian minister, King's main influence was [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his religious meetings, speeches at church, and in public discourses. King's faith was strongly based in Jesus' commandment of [[Golden Rule|loving your neighbor as yourself]], loving God above all, and loving your enemies, praying for them and blessing them. His [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] thought was also based in the injunction to ''[[turn the other cheek]]'' in the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/liberation-curriculum/classroom-resources/king-quotes-war-and-peace |title=Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Without Violence&amp;nbsp;– April 3, 1957 |publisher=Mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu |access-date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous [[Letter from Birmingham Jail]], King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus' "extremist" love, and also quoted numerous other [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] authors, which was very usual for him. In another sermon, he stated:

{{quote|Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don't plan to run for any political office. I don't plan to do anything but remain a preacher. And what I'm doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of my feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man.&lt;ref&gt;The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute.

King's private writings show that he rejected [[biblical literalism]]; he described the [[Bible]] as "mythological," doubted that Jesus was [[virgin birth of Jesus|born of a virgin]] and did not believe that the [[Book of Jonah|story of Jonah and the whale]] was true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url= https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Writings-show-King-as-liberal-Christian-2623685.php |first=Matthai |last= Chakko Kuruvila |title= Writings show King as liberal Christian, rejecting literalism |date= January 15, 2007 |access-date= June 5, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Measure of a Man'' ====
In 1959, King published a short book called ''The Measure of a Man'', which contained his sermons "[[What Is Man? (King essay)|What is Man?]]" and "The Dimensions of a Complete Life". The sermons argued for man's need for God's love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/measure-man |title=Measure of a Man, The |encyclopedia=King Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Stanford University#Research centers and institutes|Stanford University {{!}} Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute]] |date=June 2017 |access-date=December 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran African-American civil rights activist [[Bayard Rustin]] was King's first regular advisor on [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Sixties: Making Postwar Radicalism| last= Farrell|first= James J.|page= 90|isbn= 0-415-91385-3|publisher= Routledge| year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was also advised by the white activists [[Harris Wofford]] and [[Glenn Smiley]].&lt;ref name="wofford"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/wofford-harris-llewellyn|title=Wofford, Harris Llewellyn|access-date=December 3, 2019|date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rustin and Smiley came from the [[Christian pacifist]] tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the [[Journey of Reconciliation]] campaign in the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Review: Bayard Rustin: Troubles I've Seen |last=Kahlenberg |first=Richard D. |work=Washington Monthly |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n4_v29/ai_19279952 |access-date=June 12, 2008 |year=1997 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005121547/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n4_v29/ai_19279952 |archive-date=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wofford had been promoting [[Gandhism]] to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="wofford"/&gt;

King had initially known little about Gandhi and rarely used the term "nonviolence" during his early years of activism in the early 1950s. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns in his household as a means of defense against possible attackers. The pacifists guided King by showing him the alternative of [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent resistance]], arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals of civil rights than self-defense. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Enger|first=Mark and Paul|title=When Martin Luther King Jr. gave up his guns|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/when_martin_luther_king_jr_gave_up_his_guns_partner/|date=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page= 217| last=Bennett | first=Scott H.| title=Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963 | publisher=Syracuse University Press| year=2003| isbn=0-8156-3003-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the boycott, King wrote ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'', which included the chapter ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150514151301/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/1-Sept-1958_MyPilgrimageToNonviolence.pdf Pilgrimage to Nonviolence]''. King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and [[Stanley Levison]] also providing guidance and ghostwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/stride-toward-freedom-montgomery-story|title=Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story|access-date=December 3, 2019|date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was inspired by Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the "individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God".&lt;ref&gt;[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/gandhi-mohandas-k Gandhi, Mohandas K.], King Encyclopedia, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; King had "for a long time&amp;nbsp;... wanted to take a trip to India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King |first1=Martin Luther Jr. |first2=Clayborne |last2=Carson |title=The Papers of Martin Luther King Jr., Volume V: Threshold of a New Decade, January 1959&amp;nbsp;– December 1960 |publisher=University of California Press |year=2005 |page=231 |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol5/July1959_MyTriptotheLandofGandhi.pdf |isbn=0-520-24239-4 |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615084051/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol5/July1959_MyTriptotheLandofGandhi.pdf |archive-date=June 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With assistance from Harris Wofford, the [[American Friends Service Committee]], and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/india-trip|title=India Trip (1959)|date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|King|1992|p=13}} The trip to India affected King, deepening his understanding of [[nonviolent resistance]] and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, "Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity."

King's admiration of Gandhi's nonviolence did not diminish in later years. He went so far as to hold up his example when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, hailing the "successful precedent" of using nonviolence "in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire&amp;nbsp;... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Lecture by MLK|date=December 11, 1964|author=Martin Luther King|page=12|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/nobel-lecture-mlk|publisher=The King Center|access-date=August 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315071306/http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/nobel-lecture-mlk|archive-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence for King's nonviolent method was [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|On Civil Disobedience]]'' and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system.&lt;ref&gt;King, M. L. Morehouse College (Chapter 2 of The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.)&lt;/ref&gt; He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[Paul Tillich]],&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Niebuhr and Contemporary Politics: God and Power&lt;/ref&gt; and said that [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]'s ''Christianity and the Social Crisis'' left an "indelible imprint" on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns.&lt;ref name="Ansbro 1982 p. 163"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ansbro | first=J.J. | title=Martin Luther King, Jr.: The Making of a Mind | publisher=Orbis Books | location=Maryknoll, New York | chapter=Ch. 5: The Social Mission of the Christian Church | year=1982 | isbn=0-88344-333-3 | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000ansb_j7f7/page/163 | page=[https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000ansb/page/163 163] | url=https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000ansb | url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Burrow Fairclough 2013 p. 133"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Baldwin | first1=L.V. | last2=Burrow | first2=R. | last3=Fairclough | first3=A. | title=The Domestication of Martin Luther King Jr.: Clarence B.

Even after renouncing his personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with the phenomenon of self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice, but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/nonviolence-the-only-road-to-freedom/|title=Nonviolence: The Only Road to Freedom&amp;nbsp;– Teaching American History|work=teachingamericanhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as [[Colonel Stone Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2012/01/birmingham_civil_rights_activi.html|title=Birmingham civil rights activist Colonel Stone Johnson has died (slideshow)|work=AL.com|date=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Augustine Movement|Robert Hayling]], and the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/armed-resistance-civil-rights-movement-charles-e-cobb-and-danielle-l-mcguire-forgotten|title=Armed Resistance in the Civil Rights Movement: Charles E.

=== Criticism within the movement ===
King was criticized by other black leaders during the course of his participation in the civil rights movement. This included opposition by more militant thinkers such as [[Nation of Islam (religious movement)|Nation of Islam]] member [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 105| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7425-2928-1|last=Bobbitt|first=David|title=The Rhetoric of Redemption: Kenneth Burke's Redemption Drama and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] founder [[Ella Baker]] regarded King as a charismatic [[Charismatic authority|media figure]] who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7ljj_iyQcwC&amp;pg=PA298 |title=I May Not Get There with You: The True Martin Luther King, Jr|last1=Dyson|first1=Michael Eric|last2=Jagerman|first2=David L.|date=2000|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-86776-2|pages=297–99|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he became close to elite figures like [[Nelson Rockefeller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theroot.com/a-close-alliance-between-mlk-and-nelson-rockefeller-rev-1790858451|title=A Close Alliance Between MLK and Nelson Rockefeller Revealed|last=Burke|first=Kevin M.|website=The Root|language=en-us|access-date=January 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stokely Carmichael]], a protege of Baker's, became a black [[Black separatism|separatist]] and disagreed with King's plea for [[racial integration]] because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Martin Luther King, Jr. |url= https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking00ling |url-access= registration | last=Ling| first= Peter J. | pages=[https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking00ling/page/250 250–51]|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0-415-21664-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.apspuhuru.org/publications/repnow/ReparationsNow-OCR.txt| title= Abbreviated Report from the International Tribunal on Reparations for Black People in the U.S.|publisher=African People's Socialist Party| access-date=June 15, 2008|last=Yeshitela|first=Omali |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517082245/http://www.apspuhuru.org/publications/repnow/ReparationsNow-OCR.txt | archive-date=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism and involvement with Native Americans===
King was an avid supporter of Native American rights. Native Americans were also active supporters of King's [[civil rights movement]] which included the active participation of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ross | first=Gyasi | title=Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Black People and Indigenous People: How We Cash This Damn Check | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-black-people-and-indigenous_b_5a57c671e4b03a1e6098bc6d | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the [[Native American Rights Fund]] (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund.&lt;ref name="kingcreek"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bender |first1=Albert |title=Dr. King spoke out against the genocide of Native Americans |url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/dr-king-spoke-out-against-the-genocide-of-native-americans/ |website=People's World |access-date=November 25, 2018 |date=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in King's campaigns especially the [[Poor People's Campaign]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="scielo.org.za"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia |first1=Kevin |title=The American Indian Civil Rights Movement: A case study in Civil Society Protest |journal=Yesterday and Today |date=December 1, 2014 |volume=12 |pages=60–74 |url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2223-03862014000200004 |access-date=November 25, 2018 |issn=2309-9003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In King's book ''[[Why We Can't Wait]]'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.&lt;ref name="kingnatspeech"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rickert |first1=Levi |title=Dr. Martin Luther King Jr: Our Nation was Born in Genocide |url=https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-nation-born-genocide/ |website=Native News Online |publisher=Native News Online |access-date=November 25, 2018 |date=January 16, 2017 |archive-date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126092832/https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-nation-born-genocide/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

King assisted Native American people in south Alabama in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="kingcreek"/&gt; At that time the remaining [[Creek tribe|Creek]] in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools in their area. The South had many egregious racial problems: In this case, light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride school buses to previously all white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from riding the same buses.&lt;ref name="kingcreek"/&gt; Tribal leaders, upon hearing of King's desegregation campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, contacted him for assistance. He promptly responded and through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.&lt;ref name="kingcreek"/&gt;

In September 1959, King flew from [[Los Angeles, California]], to Tucson, Arizona.&lt;ref name="kingindrez"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leighton |first1=David |title=Street Smarts: MLK Jr. visited 'Papago' reservation near Tucson, was fascinated |url=https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-mlk-jr-visited-papago-reservation-near-tucson-was/article_cbc4d8f3-6d53-54f3-a783-359646fe2c82.html |website=The Arizona Daily Star |publisher=[[The Arizona Daily Star]] |access-date=November 26, 2018 |date=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After giving a speech at the [[University of Arizona]] on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change. He put into words his belief that one must not use force in this struggle "but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering."&lt;ref name="kingindrez"/&gt; King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos. On the spur of the moment, King wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Reverend Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation.&lt;ref name="kingindrez"/&gt; At the reservation King met with all the tribal leaders, and others on the reservation then ate with them.&lt;ref name="kingindrez"/&gt; King then visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there attracting a Native American crowd.&lt;ref name="kingindrez"/&gt; He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation, and then went on to give another speech at the University of Arizona.&lt;ref name="kingindrez"/&gt; King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 March on Washington]] there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota, and many from the [[Navajo nation]].&lt;ref name="kingcreek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="navtimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pineo |first1=Christopher |title=Navajos and locals in Gallup celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day |url=https://www.navajotimes.com/reznews/navajos-and-locals-in-gallup-celebrate-martin-luther-king-jr-day/ |website=Navajo Times |publisher=Navajo Times |access-date=November 26, 2018 |date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans were also active participants in the [[Poor People's Campaign]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="scielo.org.za"/&gt;

King was a major inspiration along with the [[civil rights movement]] which inspired the [[Native American rights movement]] of the 1960s and many of its leaders.&lt;ref name="kingcreek"/&gt; John Echohawk a member of the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee tribe]] and the executive director and one of the founders of the Native American Rights Fund stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.&lt;ref name="amiss"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Roy |title='I have a dream for all God's children,' Martin Luther King Jr. Day |url=http://americanindiansource.com/mlkechohawk.html |website=American Indian Source |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Politics===
As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: "I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either."&lt;ref name="Oates1993"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen B.|last=Oates|title=Let the Trumpet Sound: A Life of Martin Luther King, Jr|url=https://archive.org/details/lettrumpetsound00step/page/159|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-452-25627-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/lettrumpetsound00step/page/159 159]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, "I don't think the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] is a party full of the almighty God nor is the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]]. They both have weaknesses&amp;nbsp;... And I'm not inextricably bound to either party."&lt;ref name="King-Carson2000p364"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther Jr.|last=King|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957&amp;nbsp;– December 1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW-NYdIefPgC&amp;pg=PA364|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22231-1|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; King did praise Democratic Senator [[Paul Douglas]] of Illinois as being the "greatest of all senators" because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merriner|first1=James L.|title=Illinois' liberal giant, Paul Douglas|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-03-09/entertainment/0303080081_1_illinois-gov-paul-douglas-liberal/2|access-date=May 17, 2015|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality:

{{quote|Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern [[Dixiecrats]]. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of [[reactionary]] right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.&lt;ref name="King-Carson2000p84"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther Jr.|last=King|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957&amp;nbsp;– December 1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW-NYdIefPgC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22231-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for [[Adlai Stevenson II]] or [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]], but that "In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket."&lt;ref name="King-Carson1992p384"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther Jr.|last=King|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The papers of Martin Luther King Jr.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ysIWgsSr9AC&amp;pg=PA384|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07951-9|page=384}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, King says that in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] he privately voted for Democratic candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]: "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one." King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964."&lt;ref name="King-Carson1998p187"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin Luther Jr.|last1=King|first2=Clayborne|last2=Carson|title=The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.|url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00king/page/187|year=1998|publisher=Hachette Digital|isbn=978-0-446-52412-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00king/page/187 187]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], King urged his supporters "and all people of goodwill" to vote against Republican Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] for president, saying that his election "would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJyWWM9OHKA|title=Mr. Conservative: Barry Goldwater's opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964|date=September 18, 2006|access-date=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King supported the ideals of [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]], although he was reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the [[United States]] at the time, and the association of socialism with [[communism]]. King believed that capitalism could not adequately provide the necessities of many American people, particularly the African-American community.&lt;ref name=AntiCapitalism/&gt;

===Compensation===
{{See also|Reparations for slavery debate in the United States}}
King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50&amp;nbsp;billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=366}}

He posited that "the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils."{{sfn|Washington|1991|pp=365–67}} He presented this idea as an application of the [[common law]] regarding settlement of unpaid labor, but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, "It should benefit the disadvantaged of ''all'' races."{{sfn|Washington|1991|pp=367–68}}

===Family planning===
On being awarded the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]]'s [[Margaret Sanger Awards|Margaret Sanger Award]] on [[Sermons and speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.#cite note-8|May 5, 1966]], King said:

{{quote|Recently, the press has been filled with reports of sightings of [[flying saucers]]. While we need not give credence to these stories, they allow our imagination to speculate on how visitors from outer space would judge us. I am afraid they would be stupefied at our conduct. They would observe that for death planning we spend billions to create [[Siege cannon|engines]] and [[Military tactics|strategies]] for war. They would also observe that we spend millions to prevent death by [[disease]] and other causes. Finally they would observe that we spend paltry sums for [[population planning]], even though its [[Population growth|spontaneous growth]] is an urgent threat to life on our planet. Our visitors from outer space could be forgiven if they reported home that our planet is inhabited by a race of insane men whose future is bleak and uncertain.

There is no human circumstance more tragic than the persisting existence of a harmful condition for which a remedy is readily available. [[Family planning]], to relate population to [[Natural resource|world resources]], is possible, practical and necessary. Unlike [[Plague (disease)#First Pandemic: Early Middle Ages (Plague of Justinian)|plagues of the]] [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark ages]] or contemporary diseases we do not yet understand, the modern plague of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] is soluble by means we have discovered and with resources we possess.

What is lacking is not sufficient knowledge of the solution but universal consciousness of the gravity of the problem and education of the billions who are its victims ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/quotes|website=worldpopulationbalance.org|access-date=9 July 2014|date=January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Planning&amp;nbsp;– A Special and Urgent Concern|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-gulf-coast/mlk-acceptance-speech|publisher=[[Planned Parenthood]]|access-date=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=August 2019}}}}

===Israel===
King believed [[Israel]] has a [[Legitimacy of the State of Israel|right to exist]], saying "Peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all our might to protect her right to exist, its territorial integrity and the right to use whatever sea lanes it needs. Israel is one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy. Peace for Israel means security, and that security must be a reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/martin-luther-king-on-israel-s-security | title=Martin Luther King on Israel's Security | work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] | accessdate=March 27, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A boy once asked King about how he should deal with his [[homosexuality]]. King replied:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Tom|last=Wurtz|title=MLK agreed with Catholics on homosexuality

{{quote|Your problem is not at all an uncommon one. However, it does require careful attention. The type of feeling that you have toward boys is probably not an innate tendency, but something that has been culturally acquired. Your reasons for adopting this habit have now been consciously suppressed or unconsciously repressed. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with this problem by getting back to some of the experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit. In order to do this I would suggest that you see a good psychiatrist who can assist you in bringing to the forefront of conscience all of those experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit.

In the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General [[Robert F.

The Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King's rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country.&lt;ref name=right&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK and RFK Were Right to Wiretap MLK |last=Ryskind |first=Allan H. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200602/ai_n17173432/pg_2 |access-date=August 27, 2008 |work=Human Events |date=February 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004205959/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200602/ai_n17173432/pg_2 |archive-date=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=track&gt;{{cite news |publisher= CNN |title= FBI tracked King's every move |date=April 7, 2008 |first=Jen |last=Christensen |access-date=June 14, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/31/mlk.fbi.conspiracy/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Hoover listed the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: "No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups&amp;nbsp;... to insure [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited."&lt;ref name=Honey2007ch4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War at Home: Covert Action Against U.S. Activists and What We Can Do About It |last=Glick |first=Brian |year=1989 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0-89608-349-3 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4uvwy_C3egC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSA monitoring of King's communications===
In a secret operation code-named "[[Project MINARET|Minaret]]", the [[National Security Agency]] monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|U.S. war in Vietnam.]]&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;The Guardian, September 26, 2013, "Declassified NSA Files Show Agency Spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK Operation Minaret Set Up in 1960s to Monitor Anti-Vietnam Critics, Branded 'Disreputable If Not Outright Illegal' by NSA Itself," [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was "disreputable if not outright illegal."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of communism===
For years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential [[Red Scare|influence of communists]] in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= To See the Promised Land: The Faith Pilgrimage of Martin Luther King, Jr|pages= [https://archive.org/details/toseepromisedlan0000down/page/246 246–47]|last= Downing|first= Frederick L.|publisher= Mercer University Press|year= 1986|isbn= 0-86554-207-4|url= https://archive.org/details/toseepromisedlan0000down/page/246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Due to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an "agent of influence" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them.{{sfn|Kotz|2005|pp=70–74}} Another King lieutenant, [[Jack O'Dell]], was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Jeff|page=[https://archive.org/details/blackstrugglered0000wood/page/126 126]|year=2004|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=0-8071-2926-7|title=Black Struggle, Red Scare: Segregation and Anti-communism in the South, 1948–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/blackstrugglered0000wood/page/126}} See also: {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/realjedgarhoover0000wann |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/realjedgarhoover0000wann/page/87 87] |title=The Real J. Edgar Hoover: For the Record |last=Wannall |first=Ray |isbn=1-56311-553-0 |year=2000 |publisher=Turner Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the extensive surveillance conducted, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{citation|last=Church|first= Frank|author-link= Frank Church|title= Church Committee Book III| work =Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Case Study| publisher= [[Church Committee]]| date=April 23, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 ''Playboy'' interview, he stated that "there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida."{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=362}} He argued that Hoover was "following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to "aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements."&lt;ref name=Church /&gt; Hoover did not believe King's pledge of innocence and replied by saying that King was "the most notorious liar in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Martin Luther King Jr.: A Biography |last=Bruns |first=Roger |page=[https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000brun/page/67 67] |isbn=0-313-33686-5 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=2006 |url=https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000brun/page/67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After King gave his "I Have A Dream" speech during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, the FBI described King as "the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country."&lt;ref name=track /&gt; It alleged that he was "knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists."{{sfn|Kotz|2005|p=83}}

The attempts to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo, but had been stirred up by "communists" and "outside agitators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Democratic Individuality: A Theory of Moral Progress |page=435 |last=Gilbert |first=Alan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-38709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As context, the civil rights movement in 1950s and '60s arose from activism within the black community dating back to before World War I. King said that "the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals—the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations."{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=363}}

===CIA surveillance===
CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the [[Soviet Union]] and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32397512.pdf |title=Martin Luther King |author=CIA |date=November 5, 1967 |access-date=February 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program [[HTLINGUAL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bush-and-the-nsa-spying-s_b_12552 | title=Bush and the NSA spying scandal | first=Timothy | last=Naftali | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=December 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI having concluded that King was dangerous due to communist infiltration, attempts to discredit King began through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he also had numerous extramarital affairs.&lt;ref name=track /&gt; [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] once said that King was a "hypocritical preacher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.B.J., Hoover and Domestic Spying |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912799-2,00.html |work=Time |last=Sidey |first=Hugh |access-date=June 14, 2008 |date=February 10, 1975 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921122310/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C912799-2%2C00.html |archive-date=September 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1989 autobiography ''[[And the Walls Came Tumbling Down]]'', Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a "weakness for women", although they "all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=And the walls came tumbling down: an autobiography |last=Abernathy |first=Ralph |year=1989 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=978-0-06-016192-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/andwallscametumb00aber/page/471 471] |url=https://archive.org/details/andwallscametumb00aber/page/471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term "womanizing", that he did not specifically say King had [[extramarital sex]] and that the infidelities King had were [[emotional affair|emotional]] rather than sexual.&lt;ref name=abertappva&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.booknotes.org/Transcript/index_print.asp?ProgramID=1442 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071211111242/http://www.booknotes.org/Transcript/index_print.asp?ProgramID=1442 | archive-date=December 11, 2007 | title=And the Walls Came Tumbling Down | first=Ralph David |last=Abernathy |publisher=Booknotes |date=October 29, 1989 | access-date=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs,&lt;ref name=abertappva /&gt; such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.&lt;ref name=abertappva /&gt; In his original wording, Abernathy had stated that he saw King coming out of his room with a woman when he awoke the next morning and later said that "he may have been in there discussing and debating and trying to get her to go along with the movement, I don't know...the Sanitation Worker's Strike."&lt;ref name=abertappva /&gt;

In his 1986 book ''Bearing the Cross'', David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, "that relationship&amp;nbsp;... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings&amp;nbsp;... of King's travels." He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as "a form of anxiety reduction." Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him "painful and at times overwhelming guilt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference| url =https://archive.org/details/bearingcross00davi| url-access =registration|year=1986|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bearingcross00davi/page/375 375–76] | publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that "all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed."{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=67}} Shortly after ''Bearing the Cross'' was released, civil rights author [[Howell Raines]] gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were "sensational" and stated that Garrow was "amassing facts rather than analyzing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/07/nnp/garrow.html|title=Driven to Martyrdom|author=Raines, Howell |work=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1986|access-date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Martin Luther King |title=Conspiracy Encyclopedia |last=Burnett |first=Thom |isbn=1-84340-287-4 |publisher=Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/conspiracyencycl0000unse/page/58 58] |title-link=Conspiracy Encyclopedia |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/conspiracyencycl0000unse/page/58 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information if he did not cease his civil rights work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/popularimagesofa0000unse/page/532 532] |last=Spragens |first=William C. |title=Popular Images of American Presidents |url=https://archive.org/details/popularimagesofa0000unse |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-313-22899-5 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1988 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI–King suicide letter]] sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The American public, the church organizations that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are—an evil beast.

The letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King's extramarital liaisons.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=158–59}} King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= [https://archive.org/details/insearchofdemocr00sond/page/466 466] |last= Wilson |first= Sondra K. |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-19-511633-X |title= In Search of Democracy: The NAACP Writings of James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and Roy Wilkins (1920–1977) |url= https://archive.org/details/insearchofdemocr00sond/page/466 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to "convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC."&lt;ref name=Church /&gt; King refused to give in to the FBI's threats.&lt;ref name=track/&gt;

In 1977, [[United States District Judge|Judge]] [[John Lewis Smith Jr.]] ordered all known copies of the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI's electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to be held in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] and sealed from public access until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Documenting the Struggle for Racial Equality in the Decade of the Sixties | publisher=The National Archives and Records Administration | url =https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1997/summer/equality-in-the-sixties.html#f3 |date=Summer 1997 | last=Phillips | first=Geraldine N. | journal=Prologue | access-date=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2019, FBI files emerged alleging that King "looked on, laughed and offered advice" as one of his friends raped a woman. His biographer, [[David Garrow]], wrote that "the suggestion... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Garrow |first1=David J. |author-link1=David J.

The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report.

I have read scores of reports talking about the scurrilous activities of my husband but once again, there was nothing at all incriminating on the tape. It was a social event with people laughing and telling dirty jokes. But I did not hear Martin's voice on it, and there was nothing about sex or anything else resembling the lies J.

===Five-dollar bill===
On April 20, 2016, [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Jacob Lew]] announced that the $5, $10, and $20 bills would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the front of the $5 bill, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from King's "I Have a Dream" speech and the 1939 concert by opera singer [[Marian Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/20/report-lew-considered-anthony-10-bill/83274530/ |title=Anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman to replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill |newspaper=USAToday.com |date=April 21, 2016 |access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
