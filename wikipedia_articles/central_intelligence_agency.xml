The '''Central Intelligence Agency''' ('''CIA'''; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|.|aɪ|ˈ|eɪ}}&lt;!--English pronunciation—many G7 E1L and ESL readers might assume that this is "obvious", but it is not obvious to all of Wikipedia's global ESL audience (versus {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|i|.|ə}}, which is not how English treats it, but Spanish uses that.--&gt;), known informally as the '''Agency''' and the '''Company''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://public.oed.com/appeals/company/|title=the Company noun earlier than 1966|publisher=oed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/central-intelligence-agency|title=encyclopedia.com|publisher=social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/central-intelligence-agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a civilian [[intelligence agency|foreign intelligence service]] of the [[federal government of the United States]], officially tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing [[national security]] information from around the world, primarily through the use of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT). As a principal member of the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC), the CIA reports to the [[Director of National Intelligence]] and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Cabinet of the United States]].

Unlike the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), which is a domestic security service, the CIA has no law enforcement function and is officially mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering, with only [[National Resources Division|limited domestic intelligence collection]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The CIA serves as the national manager for the coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community. It is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee [[Covert operation|covert action]] at the behest of the [[President of the United States|President]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |url=https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2011/10/brennan_ctr_report.html |title=Secrecy News: Reducing Overclassification Through Accountability |website=Federation of American Scientists |date=October 6, 2011 |access-date=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodward |first=Bob |author-link=Bob Woodward  |title=Secret CIA Units Playing Central Combat Role |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/CIA18.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=November 18, 2001 |access-date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-p/paraguay.html |title=World Leaders – Paraguay |website=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528053421/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-p/paraguay.html |archive-date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eimer |first=Charlotte |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4289224.stm |title=Spotlight on US troops in Paraguay |work=[[BBC News]] |date=September 28, 2005 |access-date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the [[Special Activities Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Tom |title=Paraguay in a spin about Bush's alleged 100,000 acre hideaway |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/23/mainsection.tomphillips |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=October 23, 2006 |access-date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries, such as Germany's [[Federal Intelligence Service|BND]]. It has also provided support to many foreign political groups and governments, including planning, coordinating, training on torture, technical support, and was involved in several [[United States involvement in regime change|regime changes]], terrorist attacks, and planned assassinations of foreign leaders.&lt;ref name="GregGrandin2011"&gt;[[Greg Grandin]] (2011).

Since 2004 the CIA is organized under the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI). Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI, the CIA has grown in size as a response to the [[September 11 attacks]]. In 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that in the fiscal year 2010, the CIA had the largest [[United States intelligence budget|budget]] of all IC agencies, exceeding previous estimates.&lt;ref name="wp20130829"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chapter13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-INTELLIGENCE/content-detail.html |title=Preparing for the 21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence. Chapter 13 – The Cost of Intelligence |author=Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community |date=March 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA has increasingly expanded its role, including covert [[paramilitary]] operations.&lt;ref name="wp20130829"/&gt; One of its largest divisions, the Information Operations Center (IOC), has officially shifted focus from [[counter-terrorism]] to offensive [[Cyberwarfare in the United States|cyber-operations]].&lt;ref name=231cyberops&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-spy-agencies-mounted-231-offensive-cyber-operations-in-2011-documents-show/2013/08/30/d090a6ae-119e-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html |title=U.S. spy agencies mounted 231 offensive cyber-operations in 2011, documents show |first1=Barton |last1=Gellman |first2=Ellen |last2=Nakashima |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency has been the subject of [[List of CIA controversies|many controversies]], including [[Human rights violations by the CIA|human rights violations]], [[Project Mockingbird|domestic wiretapping]] and [[CIA influence on public opinion|propaganda]], and [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|allegations of drug trafficking]]. It has also appeared in [[CIA in fiction|works of fiction]], including books, films and video games.

==Purpose==
When the CIA was created, its purpose was to create a clearinghouse for foreign policy intelligence and analysis. Today, its primary purpose is to collect, analyze, evaluate, and disseminate foreign intelligence, and to carry out covert operations.

According to its fiscal 2013 budget, the CIA has five priorities:{{r|wp20130829}}
* [[Counterterrorism]], the top priority
* [[Nonproliferation]] of nuclear and other [[weapons of mass destruction]].
* Warning/informing American leaders of important overseas events.
* [[Counterintelligence]]
* [[cyberwarfare in the United States|Cyber intelligence]].

==Organizational structure==

[[File:CIA ORG Structure.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Chart showing the organization of the Central Intelligence Agency.]]
{{Main|Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency}}

The CIA has an executive office and five major directorates:
* The '''Directorate of Digital Innovation'''
* The '''Directorate of Analysis'''
* The '''Directorate of Operations'''
* The '''Directorate of Support'''
* The '''Directorate of Science and Technology'''

===Executive Office===
The [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] (D/CIA) is appointed by the President with [[Senate confirmation]] and reports directly to the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI); in practice, the CIA director interfaces with the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the [[White House]], while the Deputy Director (DD/CIA) is the internal executive of the CIA and the Chief Operating Officer (COO/CIA), known as Executive Director until 2017, leads the day-to-day work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership|title=Leadership|website=Central Intelligence Agency|date=June 5, 2017|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the third highest post of the CIA.&lt;ref name="Brennan, Haines, Park"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/sisterhood-spies-women-crack-code-cia-f2D11594601|title=Sisterhood of Spies: Women crack the code at the CIA (also see Video "CIA director: 'Women make us better'")|website=[[NBC News]]|date=November 14, 2013|access-date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Director is formally appointed by the Director without Senate confirmation,&lt;ref name="Brennan, Haines, Park"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haspel appointment"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/cia-deputy-director-gina-haspel-linked-torture-thailand-black-site|title=CIA deputy director linked to torture at Thailand black site|website=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 3, 2017|access-date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as the President's opinion plays a great role in the decision,&lt;ref name="Haspel appointment"/&gt; the Deputy Director is generally considered a political position, making the Chief Operating Officer the most senior non-political position for CIA career officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.butterfieldgroup.com/current-news/2017/10-06-2017-214238579|title=Meroe Park Joins Butterfield Board|website=[[Butterfield Bank]]|date=October 6, 2017|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Executive Office also supports the [[U.S. military]] by providing it with information it gathers, receiving information from [[military intelligence]] organizations, and cooperates with field activities. The Executive Director is in charge of the day-to-day operation of the CIA. Each branch of the military service has its own Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership |title=Leadership |website=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associate Director of military affairs, a senior military officer, manages the relationship between the CIA and the [[Unified Combatant Command]]s, who produce and deliver to the CIA regional/operational intelligence and consume national intelligence produced by the CIA.&lt;ref name=OMA&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA Support to the US Military During the Persian Gulf War |website=Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/gulfwar/061997/support.htm |date=June 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership/ciaorgchart.jpg/image.jpg |title=Organization chart |website=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=April 11, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314073648/https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership/ciaorgchart.jpg/image.jpg |archive-date=March 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directorate of Analysis===

The '''Directorate of Analysis''', through much of its history known as the '''Directorate of Intelligence''' (DI), is tasked with helping "the President and other policymakers make informed decisions about our country's national security" by looking "at all the available information on an issue and organiz[ing] it for policymakers".&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Offices of CIA – Intelligence &amp; Analysis – History|url=https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/history.html|publisher=CIA|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430083353/https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/history.html |archive-date=April 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directorate has four regional analytic groups, six groups for transnational issues, and three that focus on policy, collection, and staff support.&lt;ref name="CIA-DI-ORG"&gt;{{cite web |website=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Intelligence &amp; Analysis |url=https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/organization-1/index.html |access-date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an office dedicated to [[Iraq]]; regional analytical offices covering the [[Near East]] and [[South Asia]], Russia and Europe; and the Asian Pacific, Latin American, and African offices.

===Directorate of Operations===
{{Main|Directorate of Operations (CIA)}}
The '''Directorate of Operations''' is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence (mainly from clandestine HUMINT sources), and for covert action. The name reflects its role as the coordinator of human intelligence activities between other elements of the wider U.S. intelligence community with their HUMINT operations. This Directorate was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence, philosophy, and budget between the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) and the CIA. In spite of this, the Department of Defense recently organized its own global clandestine intelligence service, the [[Defense Clandestine Service]] (DCS),&lt;ref name=GWUEBB46&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dia-to-send-hundreds-more-spies-overseas/2012/12/01/97463e4e-399b-11e2-b01f-5f55b193f58f_story.html |title=DIA to send hundreds more spies overseas |date=December 1, 2012 |last=Miller |first=Greg |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA).

This Directorate is known to be organized by geographic regions and issues, but its precise organization is classified.&lt;ref name=NSAEBB&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB34/13-01.htm |chapter=Defense HUMINT Service Organizational Chart |title=The "Death Squad Protection" Act: Senate Measure Would Restrict Public Access to Crucial Human Rights Information Under the Freedom of Information Act |first1=Thomas S. |last1=Blanton |first2=Michael L. |last2=Evans |first3=Kate |last3=Martin |date=July 17, 2000 |work=George Washington University National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directorate of Science &amp; Technology===
{{Main|Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology|l1=Directorate of Science &amp; Technology}}
The Directorate of Science &amp; Technology was established to research, create, and manage technical collection disciplines and equipment. Many of its innovations were transferred to other intelligence organizations, or, as they became more overt, to the military services.

For example, the development of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft was done in cooperation with the [[United States Air Force]]. The U-2's original mission was clandestine [[IMINT|imagery intelligence]] over denied areas such as the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Pocock, Chris page 404"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pocock |first=Chris |title=50 Years of the U-2: The Complete Illustrated History of the 'Dragon Lady' |publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd |location=Atglen, Pennsylvania |lccn=89012535 |isbn=0-7643-2346-6 |page=404|year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently provided with [[signals intelligence]] and [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence|measurement and signature intelligence]] capabilities, and is now operated by the Air Force.

A DS&amp;T organization analyzed imagery intelligence collected by the U-2 and reconnaissance satellites called the National Photointerpretation Center (NPIC), which had analysts from both the CIA and the military services. Subsequently, NPIC was transferred to the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA).{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

===Directorate of Support===
{{Main|Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Support|l1=Directorate of Support}}
The Directorate of Support has organizational and administrative functions to significant units including:
* The '''Office of Security'''
* The '''Office of Communications'''
* The '''Office of Information Technology'''

===Directorate of Digital Innovation===
The Directorate of Digital Innovation (DDI) focuses on accelerating innovation across the Agency's mission activities. It is the Agency's newest directorate. The [[Langley, Virginia]]-based office's mission is to streamline and integrate digital and cybersecurity capabilities into the CIA's espionage, counterintelligence, all-source analysis, open-source intelligence collection, and covert action operations.&lt;ref name="fedscoop.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.fedscoop.com/new-cia-director-inherits-agency-quickly-developing-cyber-capabilities/ | title=New CIA director inherits an agency that is quickly developing cyber capabilities| date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides operations personnel with tools and techniques to use in cyber operations. It works with [[information technology]] infrastructure and practices cyber [[tradecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/digital-innovation/index.html |title = Digital Innovation — Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means retrofitting the CIA for [[cyberwarfare]]. DDI officers help accelerate the integration of innovative methods and tools to enhance the CIA's cyber and digital capabilities on a global scale and ultimately help safeguard the United States. They also apply technical expertise to exploit clandestine and publicly available information (also known as [[open-source intelligence|open source data]]) using specialized methodologies and digital tools to plan, initiate and support the technical and human-based operations of the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/careers/opportunities/support-professional/digital-targeter.html | title=Digital Targeter — Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the establishment of the new digital directorate, offensive cyber operations were undertaken by the CIA's Information Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://theintercept.com/2017/03/08/cias-new-digital-innovation-division-cant-seem-to-keep-its-own-secrets/ |title = CIA's New "Digital Innovation" Division Can't Seem to Keep its Own Secrets|date = March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about how the office specifically functions or if it deploys offensive cyber capabilities.&lt;ref name="fedscoop.com"/&gt;

The directorate had been covertly operating since approximately March 2015 but formally began operations on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2015/10/01/cia-digital-directorate.aspx|title=Inside the CIA's new Digital Directorate -|first1=Sean|last1=Lyngaas|first2=2015|last2=Oct 01|website=FCW}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to classified budget documents, the CIA's computer network operations budget for fiscal year 2013 was $685.4&amp;nbsp;million. The NSA's budget was roughly $1&amp;nbsp;billion at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-budget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html|title='Black budget' summary details U.S. spy network's successes, failures and objectives|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Greg|last2=Miller|date=August 29, 2013|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rep. [[Adam Schiff]], the California Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], endorsed the reorganization.

The CIA established its first training facility, the Office of Training and Education, in 1950. Following the end of the [[Cold War]], the CIA's training budget was slashed, which had a negative effect on [[employee retention]].&lt;ref name=campus&gt;{{cite news |last=Wendt |first=Jeff |title=A feature interview with Frans Bax, President, CIA University |newspaper=Today's Campus |url=http://www.todayscampus.com/articles/load.aspx?art=1638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite episode |title=Inside CIA University: Higher Ed for Operatives |series=Morning Edition |series-link=Morning Edition |credits=Host: [[Mary Louise Kelly]] |network=[[NPR]] |airdate=May 28, 2004 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1914175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Director of Central Intelligence [[George Tenet]] established [[CIA University]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=campus/&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt; CIA University holds between 200 and 300 courses each year, training both new hires and experienced intelligence officers, as well as CIA support staff.&lt;ref name=campus/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; The facility works in partnership with the [[National Intelligence University]], and includes the [[Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis]], the Directorate of Analysis' component of the university.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=learning&gt;{{cite web |title=Life in HR: Learning Resources |website=Central Intelligence Agency |date=February 12, 2013 |url=https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/human-resources/learning-resources.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429131704/https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/human-resources/learning-resources.html |archive-date=April 29, 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=training&gt;{{cite web |title=Training Resources |website=Central Intelligence Agency |date=January 23, 2013 |url=https://www.cia.gov/offices-of-cia/intelligence-analysis/training-resources.html |access-date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For later stage training of student operations officers, there is at least one classified training area at [[Camp Peary]], near [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].

==Budget==
{{Main|United States intelligence budget}}

Details of the overall United States intelligence budget are classified.{{r|wp20130829}} Under the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] of 1949, the Director of Central Intelligence is the only federal government employee who can spend [[black budget|"un-vouchered" government money]].&lt;ref name="cia1992"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB434/ |title=The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance: The U-2 and OXCART Programs, 1954–1974 |publisher=History Staff, Central Intelligence Agency |last1=Pedlow |first1=Gregory W. |last2=Welzenbach |first2=Donald E. |year=1992 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government showed its 1997 budget was $26.6&amp;nbsp;billion for the fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-1997-1/pr101597.html |title=Statement of the Director of Central Intelligence Regarding the Disclosure of the Aggregate Intelligence Budget for Fiscal Year 1997 |date=October 15, 1997 |website=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has disclosed a total figure for all non-military intelligence spending since 2007; the fiscal 2013 figure is $52.6&amp;nbsp;billion. According to the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]], the CIA's fiscal 2013 budget is $14.7&amp;nbsp;billion, 28% of the total and almost 50% more than the budget of the National Security Agency. CIA's [[HUMINT]] budget is $2.3&amp;nbsp;billion, the [[SIGINT]] budget is $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion, and spending for security and logistics of CIA missions is $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion. "Covert action programs," including a variety of activities such as the CIA's [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] fleet and anti-[[Iranian nuclear program]] activities, accounts for $2.6&amp;nbsp;billion.{{r|wp20130829}}

There were numerous previous attempts to obtain general information about the budget.&lt;ref name=Aftergood2002budget&gt;{{cite web |title=Declaration of Steven Aftergood |id=Case No. 02-1146 (RMU) |date=May 5, 2003 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/foia/2002/aftergood.html |website=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, reports revealed that CIA's annual budget in Fiscal Year 1963 was $550&amp;nbsp;million (inflation-adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.55|1963|r=1}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}),&lt;ref name=CIA_CostReductionProgram&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |title=CIA Cost Reduction Program |date=September 1, 1965 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/foia/1947/cia050405att.pdf |website=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the overall intelligence budget in FY 1997 was US $26.6&amp;nbsp;billion (inflation-adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|26.6|1997|r=1}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).&lt;ref name="Press Release 03/20/98 No. 03-98"&gt;{{cite web |website=Federation of American Scientists |title=CIA Discloses FY 1998 Intelligence Budget Total |date=March 20, 1998 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/foia/intel98.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been accidental disclosures; for instance, [[Mary Margaret Graham]], a former CIA official and deputy director of national intelligence for collection in 2005, said that the annual intelligence budget was $44&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref name="NYT2005-11-08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/08/politics/08budget.html |title=Official Reveals Budget for U.S. Intelligence |last=Shane |first=Scott |date=November 8, 2005|newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1994 Congress accidentally published a budget of $43.4&amp;nbsp;billion (in 2012 dollars) in 1994 for the non-military National Intelligence Program, including $4.8&amp;nbsp;billion for the CIA.{{r|wp20130829}}

After the [[Marshall Plan]] was approved, appropriating $13.7&amp;nbsp;billion over five years, 5% of those funds or $685&amp;nbsp;million were secretly made available to the CIA. A portion of the enormous M-fund, established by the U.S. government during the post-war period for reconstruction of Japan, was secretly steered to the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;''Legacy of Ashes,'' p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employees==
{{expand section|date=May 2019}}

===Polygraphing===
[[Robert Baer]], a [[CNN]] analyst and former CIA operative, stated that normally a CIA employee undergoes a [[polygraph]] examination every three to four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/01/exclusive-dozens-of-cia-operatives-on-the-ground-during-benghazi-attack/?hpt=hp_c2 |title=Exclusive: Dozens of CIA operatives on the ground during Benghazi attack |website=[[CNN]] |date=August 1, 2013 |access-date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other intelligence agencies==
{{Global surveillance}}
The CIA acts as the primary US HUMINT and general analytic agency, under the [[Director of National Intelligence]], who directs or coordinates the 16 member organizations of the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. In addition, it obtains information from other U.S. government intelligence agencies, commercial information sources, and foreign intelligence services.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===U.S. agencies===
&lt;!-- this doesn't seem related to the CIA: A number of intelligence organizations are fully or partially under the budgetary control of the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] or other cabinet officers such as the [[United States Attorney General]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}--&gt;CIA employees form part of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO) workforce, created as a joint office of the CIA and [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] to operate the spy satellites of the US military.

The [[Special Collections Service]] is a joint CIA and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) office that conducts clandestine electronic [[Global surveillance|surveillance in embassies and hostile territory]] throughout the world.
&lt;!--As do other analytic members of the U.S. intelligence community, such as the Department of State's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] and the analytic division of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), the CIA's raw input includes imagery intelligence (IMINT) collected by the air and space systems of the NRO, processed by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), computer signals intelligence (SIGINT) of the NSA, and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) from the DIA MASINT center.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}--&gt;

===Foreign intelligence services===
The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of Germany's [[Federal Intelligence Service]] (BND), the United Kingdom's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (the SIS or MI6), the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS), the French foreign intelligence service {{lang|fr|[[Directorate-General for External Security|Direction générale de la Sécurité extérieure]]}} (DGSE), the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian Foreign Intelligence Service]] (''{{lang|ru-Latn|Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki}}'', SVR), the Chinese [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS), the Indian [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Service]], Israel's [[Mossad]], and South Korea's [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] (NIS). While the preceding agencies both collect and analyze information, some like the U.S. State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] are purely analytical agencies.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The CIA was instrumental in the establishment of intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries, including Germany's BND.

The closest links of the U.S. IC to other foreign intelligence agencies are to Anglophone countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Special communications signals that intelligence-related messages can be shared with these four countries.&lt;ref name="DMS1999-03-19"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/dod/genser.pdf |title=Zdarm (Defense Messaging Service) ''Genser'' (General Service) Message Security Classifications, Categories, and Marking Phrase Requirements Version 1.2 |date=March 19, 1999 |author=US Defense Information Services Agency |website=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; An indication of the United States' close operational cooperation is the creation of a new message distribution label within the main U.S. military communications network. Previously, the marking of NOFORN (i.e., No Foreign Nationals) required the originator to specify which, if any, non-U.S. countries could receive the information. A new handling caveat, USA/AUS/CAN/GBR/NZL ''[[Five Eyes]]'', used primarily on intelligence messages, gives an easier way to indicate that the material can be shared with Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand.

[[File:Cia-memorial-wall.jpg|thumb|The 113 stars on the [[CIA Memorial Wall]] in the original CIA headquarters, each representing a CIA officer killed in action]]
The Central Intelligence Agency was created on July 26, 1947, when [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]] into law. A major impetus for the creation of the agency was growing tensions with the USSR following the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Michael |title=CIA Cold War Records: THE CIA UNDER HARRY TRUMAN — Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-cia-under-harry-truman |website=CIA.gov |access-date=June 25, 2019 |date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immediate predecessors===
The success of the [[British Commandos]] during World War II prompted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to authorize the creation of an intelligence service modeled after the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), and [[Special Operations Executive]]. This led to the creation of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) established by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942. On September 20, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, Harry S. Truman signed an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] dissolving the OSS, and by October 1945 its functions had been divided between the Departments of State and War. The division lasted only a few months. The first public mention of the "Central Intelligence Agency" appeared on a command-restructuring proposal presented by [[Jim Forrestal]] and [[Arthur Radford]] to the [[U.S. Senate]] Military Affairs Committee at the end of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852560,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307114013/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852560,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 7, 2008 |title=Army &amp; Navy – Merger: Navy Compromise |date=December 10, 1945 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army Intelligence agent [[Sidney Mashbir|Colonel Sidney Mashbir]] and [[Ellis M.

It also exempted the CIA from having to disclose its "organization, functions, officials, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed." It created the program "PL-110" to handle defectors and other "essential aliens" who fell outside normal immigration procedures.&lt;ref name="GEORGE"&gt;{{cite web |title=George Tenet v.

===Intelligence vs. action===
At the outset of the [[Korean War]] the CIA still only had a few thousand employees, around one thousand of whom worked in analysis. Intelligence primarily came from the Office of Reports and Estimates, which drew its reports from a daily take of State Department telegrams, military dispatches, and other public documents. The CIA still lacked its intelligence-gathering abilities.&lt;ref name=ciakorea&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/44/2010-05-01.pdf |first=Clayton |last=Laurie |title=The Korean War and the Central Intelligence Agency |website=Center for the Study of Intelligence |access-date=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 1950, shortly after, Truman announced [[Walter Bedell Smith]] as the new Director of the CIA. The change in leadership was took place shortly after the [[Korean War|invasion]] of [[South Korea]], as the lack of a clear warning to the President and National Security Council about the impending North Korean invasion was seen as a grave failure of Intelligence.{{clarify |date=June 2015|reason=The failure to clearly warn the President &amp; military about the invasion}}&lt;ref name=ciakorea /&gt;

The CIA had different demands placed on it by the various bodies overseeing it. Truman wanted a centralized group to organize the information that reached him,{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=14}}&lt;ref name=100days&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol38no1/pdf/v38i1a06p.pdf |title=Fifteen DCIs' First 100 Days |journal=Studies in Intelligence |volume=38 |number=1 |date=January 1993 |access-date=August 26, 2017 |publisher=[[Center for the Study of Intelligence]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Defense wanted military intelligence and covert action, and the State Department wanted to create global political change favorable to the US. Thus the two areas of responsibility for the CIA were covert action and covert intelligence. One of the main targets for intelligence gathering was the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]], which had also been a priority of the CIA's predecessors.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=14}}&lt;ref name=100days /&gt;&lt;ref name=souerslookback&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2014-featured-story-archive/a-look-back-the-first-director-of-central-intelligence.html |title=A Look Back: The First Director of Central Intelligence |website=Central Intelligence Agency |date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Air Force general [[Hoyt Vandenberg]], the CIG's second director, created the Office of Special Operations (OSO), as well as the Office of Reports and Estimates (ORE).&lt;ref name=100days /&gt; Initially the OSO was tasked with spying and subversion overseas with a budget of $15&amp;nbsp;million, the largesse of a small number of patrons in Congress. Vandenberg's goals were much like the ones set out by his predecessor; finding out "everything about the Soviet forces in Eastern and Central Europe – their movements, their capabilities, and their intentions."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=17}}

On June 18, 1948, the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2&lt;ref name="NSC10/2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945-50Intel/d292 |work=U.S. Department of State |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1945–1950, Emergence of the Intelligence Establishment |at=Document 292, Section 5 |access-date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for covert action against the USSR,{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=29}} and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against "hostile foreign states or groups" that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government. To this end, the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] (OPC) was created inside the new CIA. The OPC was unique; [[Frank Wisner]], the head of the OPC, answered not to the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]], but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC and the OPC's actions were a secret even from the head of the CIA. Most CIA stations had two station chiefs, one working for the OSO, and one working for the OPC.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=33}}

The early track record of the CIA was poor, with the agency unable to provide sufficient intelligence about the Soviet takeovers of [[Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Berlin Blockade|Soviet blockade of Berlin]], and the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]. In particular, the agency failed to predict the Chinese entry into the [[Korean War]] with 300,000 troops.&lt;ref name=mistakes&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/fall_winter_2001/article06.html |title=Two Strategic Intelligence Mistakes in Korea, 1950 |first=P.

{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Korean War}}
At the beginning of the Korean War, CIA officer Hans Tofte claimed to have turned a thousand North Korean expatriates into a guerrilla force tasked with infiltration, guerrilla warfare, and pilot rescue.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=56}} In 1952 the CIA sent 1,500 more expatriate agents north. [[Seoul]] station chief Albert Haney would openly celebrate the capabilities of those agents, and the information they sent.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=56}} In September 1952 Haney was replaced by John Limond Hart, a Europe veteran with a vivid memory for bitter experiences of misinformation.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=56}} Hart was suspicious of the parade of successes reported by Tofte and Haney and launched an investigation which determined that the entirety of the information supplied by the Korean sources was false or misleading.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=57}} After the war, internal reviews by the CIA would corroborate Hart's findings. The CIA's Seoul station had 200 officers, but not a single speaker of Korean.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=57}} Hart reported to Washington that Seoul station was hopeless, and could not be salvaged. Loftus Becker, Deputy Director of Intelligence, was sent personally to tell Hart that the CIA had to keep the station open to save face. Becker returned to Washington, pronounced the situation to be "hopeless," and that, after touring the CIA's Far East operations, the CIA's ability to gather intelligence in the far east was "almost negligible".{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=57}} He then resigned. Air Force Colonel James Kallis stated that CIA director [[Allen Dulles]] continued to praise the CIA's Korean force, despite knowing that they were under enemy control.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=58}} When China entered the war in 1950, the CIA attempted a number of subversive operations in the country, all of which failed due to the presence of double agents. Millions of dollars were spent in these efforts.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|pp=58–61}} These included a team of young CIA officers airdropped into China who were ambushed, and CIA funds being used to set up a global heroin empire in Burma's [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] following a betrayal by another double agent.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|pp=58–61}}

The nationalization of the British-funded Iranian oil industry, including the largest oil refinery in the world, was disastrous for Mosaddegh. A British naval embargo closed the British oil facilities, which Iran had no skilled workers to operate. In 1952, Mosaddegh resisted the royal refusal to approve his Minister of War and resigned in protest. The National Front took to the streets in protest. Fearing a loss of control, the military pulled its troops back five days later, and [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] gave in to Mosaddegh's demands. Mosaddegh quickly replaced military leaders loyal to the Shah with those loyal to him, giving him personal control over the military. Given six months of emergency powers, Mosaddegh unilaterally passed legislation. When that six months expired, his powers were extended for another year. In 1953, Mossadegh [[1953 Iranian parliamentary dissolution referendum|dismissed parliament]] and assumed dictatorial powers. This power grab triggered the Shah to exercise his constitutional right to dismiss Mosaddegh. Mosaddegh launched a military [[Coup d'état|coup]] as the Shah fled the country. Under CIA Director Allen Dulles, Operation Ajax was put into motion. Its goal was to overthrow Mossadegh with military support from General Fazlollah Zahedi and install a pro-western regime headed by the Shah of Iran.

The return of the Shah to power, and the impression, cultivated by [[Allen Dulles]], that an effective CIA had been able to guide that nation to friendly and stable relations with the West triggered planning for Operation PBSuccess, a plan to overthrow [[Guatemala]]n President [[Jacobo Arbenz]].{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=93}} The plan was exposed in major newspapers before it happened after a CIA agent left plans for the coup in his [[Guatemala City]] hotel room.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=95}}

The [[Guatemalan Revolution]] of 1944–54 overthrew the U.S. backed dictator [[Jorge Ubico]] and brought a democratically elected government to power. The government began an ambitious [[Decree 900|agrarian reform]] program attempting to grant land to millions of landless peasants.

On June 18, 1954, [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] led 480 CIA-trained men across the border from [[Honduras]] into Guatemala. The weapons had also come from the CIA.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}} The CIA also mounted a psychological campaign to convince the Guatemalan people and government that Armas' victory was a ''fait accompli'', the largest part of which was a radio broadcast entitled "The Voice of Liberation" which announced that Guatemalan exiles led by Castillo Armas were shortly about to liberate the country.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}} On June 25, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} The army refused, forcing Jacobo Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954.

===Syria===
{{main|CIA activities in Syria}}
In 1949, Colonel [[Adib Shishakli]] rose to power in Syria in a CIA-backed coup. Four years later, he would be overthrown by the military, [[Ba'ath]]ists, and communists. The CIA and MI6 started funding right-wing members of the military but suffered a huge setback in the aftermath of the [[Suez Crisis]]. CIA Agent Rocky Stone, who had played a minor role in the Iranian Revolution, was working at the [[Damascus]] embassy as a diplomat but was the station chief. Syrian officers on the CIA dole quickly appeared on television stating that they had received money from "corrupt and sinister Americans" "in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=139}} Syrian forces surrounded the embassy and rousted Agent Stone, who confessed and subsequently made history as the first American diplomat expelled from an Arab nation. This strengthened ties between Syria and Egypt, helping establish the [[United Arab Republic]], and poisoning the well for the US for the foreseeable future.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=139}}

===Indonesia===
{{main|CIA activities in Indonesia}}
{{See also|Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66}}
The charismatic leader of [[Indonesia]] was President [[Sukarno]]. His declaration of neutrality in the Cold War put the suspicions of the CIA on him. After Sukarno hosted [[Bandung Conference]], promoting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the Eisenhower White House responded with NSC 5518 authorizing "all feasible covert means" to move Indonesia into the Western sphere.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=143}}

The US had no clear policy on Indonesia. Eisenhower sent his special assistant for security operations, F. M. Dearborn Jr., to Jakarta. His report that there was high instability, and that the US lacked stable allies, reinforced the domino theory. Indonesia suffered from what he described as "subversion by democracy".{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=145}} The CIA decided to attempt another military coup in Indonesia, where the Indonesian military was trained by the US, had a strong professional relationship with the US military, had a pro-American officer corps that strongly supported their government, and a strong belief in civilian control of the military, instilled partly by its close association with the US military.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=146}}

On September 25, 1957, Eisenhower ordered the CIA to start a revolution in Indonesia with the goal of regime change. Three days later, ''Blitz'', a Soviet-controlled weekly in India,{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;q=blitz 170]}} reported that the US was plotting to overthrow Sukarno. The story was picked up by the media in Indonesia. One of the first parts of the operation was an 11,500-ton US Navy [[USS Thomaston (LSD-28)|ship]] landing at [[Sumatra]], delivering weapons for as many as 8,000 potential revolutionaries.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC&amp;pg=PA148 148]}}{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}

In support of the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]]-[[Permesta]] Movement, formed by dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera and North Sulawesi with the aim of overthrowing the Sukarno regime, a  [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] piloted by CIA agent [[Allen Lawrence Pope]] attacked Indonesian military targets in April and May 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Roadnight | first=Andrew | title=United States Policy towards Indonesia in the Truman and Eisenhower Years | year=2002 | pages=162 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | location=New York | isbn=978-0-333-79315-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA described the airstrikes to the President as attacks by "dissident planes." Pope's B-26 was shot down over Ambon, Indonesia on May 18, 1958, and he bailed out. When he was captured, the Indonesian military found his personnel records, after-action reports, and his membership card for the officer's club at [[Clark Field]]. On March 9, [[John Foster Dulles|Foster Dulles]], the Secretary of State, and brother of DCI [[Allen Dulles]] made a public statement calling for a revolt against communist despotism under Sukarno. Three days later, the CIA reported to the White House that the Indonesian Army's actions against the CIA-supported revolution were suppressing communism.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=153}}

After Indonesia, Eisenhower displayed mistrust of both the CIA and its Director, Allen Dulles. Dulles too displayed mistrust of the CIA itself. Abbot Smith, a CIA analyst who later became chief of the Office of National Estimates, said, "We had constructed for ourselves a picture of the USSR, and whatever happened had to be made to fit into this picture. Intelligence estimators can hardly commit a more abominable sin." On December 16, Eisenhower received a report from his intelligence board of consultants that said the agency was "incapable of making objective appraisals of its own intelligence information as well as its own operations."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=154}}

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
{{main|CIA activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
In the election of [[Patrice Lumumba]] as Prime minister, and his acceptance of Soviet support during the [[Congo Crisis]], the CIA saw another possible Cuba. This view swayed the White House. Eisenhower ordered that Lumumba be "eliminated." In September 1960, President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] ordered the dismissal of Lumumba and his cabinet. The CIA delivered a quarter of a million dollars to [[Joseph Mobutu]] in October, their favored Congolese political figure. Lumumba was imprisoned by Mobutu in December and then handed over to Katangan authorities who, with the aid of Belgium, executed him by firing squad in January 1961.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=163}}

===Gary Powers U-2 shootdown===

These models are exact replicas at one-sixth scale of the real planes. All three had photographic capabilities. The U-2 was one of the first espionage planes developed by the CIA. The A-12 set unheralded flight records. The D-21 drone was one of the first crewless aircraft ever built. [[Lockheed Martin Corporation]] donated all three models to the CIA.]]

After the [[bomber gap]] came the [[Missile gap|missile gap]]. Eisenhower wanted to use the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] to disprove the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary [[Khrushchev]] at [[Camp David]]. Another reason the President objected to the use of the U-2 was that, in the nuclear age, the intelligence he needed most was on their intentions, without which, the US would face a paralysis of intelligence. He was particularly worried that U-2 flights could be seen as preparations for first-strike attacks. He had high hopes for an upcoming meeting with Khrushchev in Paris. Eisenhower finally gave in to CIA pressure to authorize a 16-day window for flights, which was extended an additional six days because of poor weather. On May 1, 1960, the USSR shot down a U-2 flying over the Soviet territory. To Eisenhower, the ensuing coverup destroyed his perceived honesty and his hope of leaving a legacy of thawing relations with Khrushchev. It would also mark the beginning of a long downward slide in the credibility of the Office of the President of the United States. Eisenhower later said that the U-2 coverup was the greatest regret of his presidency.&lt;ref name=Ashes&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weiner |first1=Tim |title=Legacy of ashes : The history of the CIA |date=2007 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=978-0-385-51445-3 |edition=1st |ref=Ashes |url=https://archive.org/details/legacyofasheshis00wein }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}}

===Dominican Republic===
{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Dominican Republic}}
The human rights abuses of Generalissimo [[Rafael Trujillo]] had a history of more than three decades, but in August 1960 the United States severed diplomatic relations. The CIA's Special group had decided to arm Dominicans in hopes of an assassination. The CIA had dispersed three rifles and three .38 revolvers, but things paused as Kennedy assumed office. An order approved by Kennedy resulted in the dispersal of four machine guns. Trujillo died from gunshot wounds two weeks later. In the aftermath, Robert Kennedy wrote that the CIA had succeeded where it had failed many times in the past, but in the face of that success, it was caught flatfooted, having failed to plan what to do next.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=172}}

The CIA welcomed [[Fidel Castro]] on his visit to DC, and gave him a face-to-face briefing. The CIA hoped that Castro would bring about a friendly democratic government, and planned to curry his favor with money and guns. On December 11, 1959, a memo reached the DCI's desk recommending Castro's "elimination." Dulles replaced the word "elimination" with "removal," and set the wheels in motion.{{Colloquialism|date=June 2021}} By mid-August 1960, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.|Dick Bissell]] would seek, with the blessing of the CIA, to hire the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] to assassinate Castro.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=161}}

The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] was a failed military invasion of [[Cuba]] undertaken by the CIA-sponsored paramilitary group [[Brigade 2506]] on April 17, 1961. A counter-revolutionary military, trained and funded by the CIA, Brigade 2506 fronted the armed wing of the [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front|Democratic Revolutionary Front]] (DRF) and intended to overthrow the [[Politics of Cuba|increasingly communist government]] of [[Fidel Castro]]. Launched from [[Guatemala]], the invading force was defeated within three days by the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]], under the direct command of Prime Minister Fidel Castro. US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was concerned at the direction Castro's government was taking, and in March 1960, Eisenhower allocated $13.1&amp;nbsp;million to the CIA to plan Castro's overthrow. The CIA proceeded to organize the operation with the aid of various Cuban counter-revolutionary forces, training Brigade 2506 in Guatemala. Over 1,400 paramilitaries set out for Cuba by boat on April 13. Two days later on April 15, eight CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers attacked Cuban airfields. On the night of April 16, the main invasion landed in the [[Bay of Pigs]], but by April 20, the invaders finally surrendered. The failed invasion strengthened the position of Castro's leadership as well as his ties with the USSR. This led eventually to the events of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The invasion was a major embarrassment for [[US foreign policy]]. US President [[John F. Kennedy]] ordered a number of internal investigations across [[Latin America]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Taylor Board was commissioned to determine what went wrong in Cuba. The Board came to the same conclusion that the Jan '61 President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities had concluded, and many other reviews prior, and to come, that Covert Action had to be completely isolated from intelligence and analysis. The [[Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General|Inspector General of the CIA]] investigated the Bay of Pigs. He concluded that there was a need to improve the organization and management of the CIA drastically. The Special Group (Later renamed the 303 Committee) was convened in an oversight role.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Cuba: Sabotage and Terrorism===
{{main|Operation Mongoose}}
After the failure of the attempted invasion at the Bay of Pigs, the CIA proposed a program of sabotage and terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets in Cuba, with the stated intent to bring down the Cuban administration and institute a new government.

=== Brazil ===
{{main|1964 Brazilian coup d'état}}
The CIA and the United States government were involved in the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]]. The coup occurred from March 31 to April 1, which resulted in the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]] ousting President [[João Goulart]]. The United States saw Goulart as a left-wing threat in Latin America. Secret cables written by the US Ambassador to Brazil, [[Lincoln Gordon]], confirmed that the CIA was involved in covert action in Brazil. The CIA encouraged "pro-democracy street rallies" in Brazil, for instance, to create dissent against Goulart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz02.pdf|title=Top Secret Cable from Rio de Janeiro|last=Gordon|first=Lincoln|date=27 March 1964|website=NSA Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indochina, Tibet and the Vietnam War (1954–1975)===
{{main|CIA Tibetan program|CIA activities in Vietnam|Vietnam War|Phoenix Program|Operation Barrel Roll|CIA activities in Laos|Laotian Civil War}}
The OSS Patti mission arrived in [[Vietnam]] near the end of World War II, and had significant interaction with the leaders of many Vietnamese factions, including [[Ho Chi Minh]].&lt;ref name=Patti&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Viet Nam?: Prelude to America's albatross |last=Patti |first=Archimedes L. A. |publisher=University of California Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-520-04156-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CIA Tibetan program]] consisted of political plots, [[propaganda]] distribution, and paramilitary and intelligence gathering based on U.S. commitments made to the [[Dalai Lama]] in 1951 and 1956.&lt;ref name="officiehis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Status Report on Tibetan Operations |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v30/d342 |publisher=[[Office of the Historian]] |date=January 26, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of U.S. combat involvement in the Vietnam War, there was considerable argument about progress among the Department of Defense under [[Robert McNamara]], the CIA, and, to some extent, the intelligence staff of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|Military Assistance Command Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Adams1998&gt;{{cite book |title=War of Numbers: An Intelligence Memoir |first=Sam |last=Adams |publisher=Steerforth Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-883642-23-X |url=https://archive.org/details/warofnumbersinte00adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime between 1959 and 1961, the CIA started Project Tiger, a program of dropping South Vietnamese agents into North Vietnam to gather intelligence. These were failures; the Deputy Chief for Project Tiger, Captain Do Van Tien, admitted that he was an agent for Hanoi.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=213}}

====Johnson====
In the face of the failure of Project Tiger, the Pentagon wanted CIA paramilitary forces to participate in their Op Plan 64A, this resulted in the CIA's foreign paramilitaries being put under the command of the DOD, a move seen as a slippery slope inside the CIA, a slide from covert action towards militarization.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=237}}

The antiwar movement rapidly expanded across the United States during the Johnson presidency. Johnson wanted CIA Director Richard Helms to substantiate Johnson's hunch that Moscow and Beijing were financing and influencing the American antiwar movement. Thus, in the fall of 1967, the CIA launched a domestic surveillance program code-named Chaos that would linger for a total of seven years. Police departments across the country cooperated in tandem with the agency, amassing a "computer index of 300,000 names of American people and organizations, and extensive files on 7,200 citizens." Helms hatched a "Special Operations Group" in which "[eleven] CIA officers grew long hair, learned the jargon of the New Left, and went off to infiltrate peace groups in the United States and Europe."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=285}}

A CIA analyst's assessment of Vietnam was that the US was "becoming progressively divorced from reality... [and] proceeding with far more courage than wisdom".{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=248}}

===Nixon===
{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Nixon}}
In 1971, the NSA and CIA were engaged in domestic spying. The DOD was eavesdropping on [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]]. The White House and Camp David were wired for sound. Nixon and Kissinger were eavesdropping on their aides, as well as reporters. Famously, Nixon's [[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]] had in their number many former CIA agents, including [[Howard Hunt]], [[James W. McCord Jr.|Jim McCord]], and [[Eugenio Martinez]]. On July 7, 1971, [[John Ehrlichman]], Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman "know that [Hunt] was, in fact, doing some things for the President... you should consider he has pretty much ''carte blanche''"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=319}} Importantly, this included a camera, disguises, a voice-altering device, and ID papers furnished by the CIA, as well as the CIA's participation developing film from the burglary Hunt staged on the office of [[Pentagon Papers]] leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s psychologist.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On June 17, Nixon's Plumbers were caught burglarizing the DNC offices in the Watergate. On June 23, DCI Helms was ordered by the White House to wave the FBI off using national security as a pretext. The new DCI, Walters, another Nixon hack, called the acting director of the FBI and told him to drop the investigation as ordered.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=321}} On June 26, Nixon's counsel [[John Dean]] ordered DCI Walters to pay the plumbers untraceable hush money. The CIA was the only part of the government that had the power to make off the book payments, but it could only be done on the orders of the CI, or, if he was out of the country, the DCI. The Acting Director of the FBI started breaking ranks. He demanded the CIA produce a signed document attesting to the national security threat of the investigation. Jim McCord's lawyer contacted the CIA informing them that McCord had been offered a Presidential pardon if he fingered the CIA, testifying that the break-in had been an operation of the CIA. Nixon had long been frustrated by what he saw as a liberal infection inside the CIA and had been trying for years to tear the CIA out by its roots. McCord wrote "If [DCI] Helms goes (takes the fall) and the Watergate operation is laid at the CIA's feet, where it does not belong, every tree in the forest will fall. It will be a scorched desert."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=322}}

On November 13, after Nixon's landslide re-election, Nixon told Kissinger "[I intend] to ruin the Foreign Service. I mean ruin it – the old Foreign Service – and to build a new one." He had similar designs for the CIA and intended to replace Helms with [[James Schlesinger]].{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=322}} Nixon had told Helms that he was on the way out, and promised that Helms could stay on until his 60th birthday, the mandatory retirement age. On February 2, Nixon broke that promise, carrying through with his intention to "remove the deadwood" from the CIA. "Get rid of the clowns" was his order to the incoming CI. Kissinger had been running the CIA since the beginning of Nixon's presidency, but Nixon impressed on Schlesinger that he must appear to Congress to be in charge, averting their suspicion of Kissinger's involvement.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=323}} Nixon also hoped that Schlesinger could push through broader changes in the intelligence community that he had been working towards for years, the creation of a Director of National Intelligence, and spinning off the covert action part of the CIA into a separate organ. Before Helms would leave office, he would destroy every tape he had secretly made of meetings in his office, and many of the papers on [[Project MKUltra]]. In Schlesinger's 17-week tenure, in his assertion to President Nixon that it was "imperative to cut back on 'the prominence of CIA operations' around the world," the director fired more than 1,500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner Tim 2007''A Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' New York Doubleday p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; As Watergate threw the spotlight on the CIA, Schlesinger, who had been kept in the dark about the CIA's involvement, decided he needed to know what skeletons were in the closet. He issued a memo to every CIA employee directing them to disclose to him any CIA activity they knew of past or present that could fall outside the scope of the CIA's charter.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

This became the [[Family Jewels (CIA)|Family Jewels]]. It included information linking the CIA to the assassination of foreign leaders, the illegal surveillance of some 7,000 U.S. citizens involved in the antiwar movement ([[Operation CHAOS]]), the [[Project MKUltra|CIA had also experimented on U.S. and Canadian citizens without their knowledge]], secretly giving them [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (among other things) and observing the results.&lt;ref name="'70s 49"/&gt; This prompted Congress to create the [[Church Committee]] in the Senate, and the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Pike Committee]] in the House. President [[Gerald Ford]] created the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]],&lt;ref name="'70s 49"/&gt; and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders. DCI Colby leaked the papers to the press, later he stated that he believed that providing Congress with this information was the correct thing to do, and ultimately in the CIA's interests.&lt;ref name="TMNK"&gt;{{cite video |people=Carl Colby (director) |date=September 2011 |title=The Man Nobody Knew: In Search of My Father, CIA Spymaster William Colby |url=http://firstrunfeatures.com/themannobodyknew/ |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Act 4 Entertainment |location=New York City |access-date= September 18, 2011 |ref=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional Investigations===
Acting Attorney General [[Laurence Silberman]] learned of the existence of the Family Jewels and issued a subpoena for them, prompting eight congressional investigations on the domestic spying activities of the CIA. [[Bill Colby]]'s short tenure as DCI would end with the [[Halloween Massacre]]. His replacement was [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]]. At the time, the DOD had control of 80% of the intelligence budget.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=347}} Communication and coordination between the CIA and the DOD would suffer greatly under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The CIA's budget for hiring clandestine officers had been squeezed out by the paramilitary operations in south-east Asia, and the government's poor popularity further strained hiring. This left the agency bloated with middle management, and anemic in younger officers. With employee training taking five years, the agency's only hope would be on the trickle of new officers coming to fruition years in the future. The CIA would see another setback as communists would take Angola. [[William J. Casey]], a member of Ford's Intelligence Advisory Board, obtained Bush's approval to allow a team from outside the CIA to produce Soviet military estimates as a "Team B." The "B" team was composed of hawks. Their estimates were the highest that could be justified, and they painted a picture of a growing Soviet military when the Soviet military was indeed shrinking. Many of their reports found their way to the press. As a result of the investigations, congressional oversight of the CIA eventually evolved into a select intelligence committee in the House, and Senate supervising covert actions authorized by the President.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Iran/Contra===
{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Iran/Contra}}
Under President [[Jimmy Carter]], the CIA was conducting covertly funded pro-American opposition against the [[Sandinista]]. In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect [[El Salvador]] by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms into the country to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was arming and training Nicaraguans [[Contras]] in [[Honduras]] in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in [[Nicaragua]].{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=380}} Through the intelligence branch of the CIA supported [[William J. Casey]]'s tenure as DCI little of what he said in the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=380}} On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan testified before Congress, assuring them that the CIA was not trying to topple the Nicaraguan government.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====Lebanon====
The CIA's prime source in Lebanon was [[Bashir Gemayel]], a member of the Christian Maronite sect. The uprising against the Maronite minority blinded the CIA. Israel invaded Lebanon, and, along with the CIA, propped up Gemayel. This got Gemayel's assurance that Americans would be protected in Lebanon. Thirteen days later he was assassinated. [[Imad Mughniyah]], a [[Hezbollah]] assassin, would target Americans in retaliation for the Israeli invasion, the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], and the US Marines of the Multi-National Force for their role in opposing the PLO in Lebanon. On April 18, 1983, a 2,000 lb car bomb exploded in the lobby of the American embassy in [[Beirut]], killing 63 people, including 17 Americans and 7 CIA officers, including [[Robert Ames (CIA official)|Robert Ames]],{{Copy edit inline|date=June 2021}} one of the CIA's best Middle East experts. America's fortunes in Lebanon would only suffer more as America's poorly-directed retaliation for the bombing was interpreted by many as support for the Christian Maronite minority. On October 23, 1983, two bombs ([[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|1983 Beirut Bombing]]) were set off in Beirut, including a 10-ton bomb at a US military barracks that killed 242 people.

The Embassy bombing killed the CIA's Beirut Station Chief, Ken Haas. [[William Francis Buckley|Bill Buckley]] was sent in to replace him. Eighteen days after the US Marines left Lebanon, Buckley was kidnapped. On March 7, 1984, Jeremy Levin, CNN Bureau Chief in Beirut, was kidnapped. Twelve more Americans would be captured in Beirut during the Reagan Administration. Manucher Ghorbanifar, a former [[Savak]] agent, was an information seller, and the subject of a rare CIA burn notice{{Colloquialism|date=June 2021}} for his track record of misinformation. He reached out to the agency offering a back channel to Iran, suggesting a trade of missiles that would be lucrative to the intermediaries.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=397}}

=== Pakistan ===
{{main|CIA activities in Pakistan}}
It has been alleged by such authors as [[Ahmed Rashid]] that the CIA and [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] have been waging a clandestine war. The [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Taliban]]{{snd}}with whom the United States is [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|officially in conflict]]{{snd}}is headquartered in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas and according to some reports is largely funded by the ISI.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020|reason=extraordinary claim}} The Pakistani government denies this.

===India–Pakistan geopolitical tensions===
On May 11, 1998, CIA Director George Tenet and his agency were taken aback by India's [[Pokhran-II|second nuclear test]]. The bellicose gesture ruffled the feathers{{Colloquialism|date=June 2021}} of its nuclear-capable adversary, Pakistan, and, furthermore, "remade the balance of power in the world." The nuclear test was New Delhi's calculated response to Pakistan previously testing new missiles in its expanding arsenal. This series of events subsequently revealed the CIA's "failure of espionage, a failure to read photographs, a failure to comprehend reports, a failure to think, and a failure to see."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=468}}

===Poland 1980–1989===
{{See also|Poland–United States relations}}
Unlike the Carter Administration, the Reagan Administration supported the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in [[Poland]], and{{snd}}based on CIA intelligence{{snd}}waged a public relations campaign to deter what the Carter administration felt was "an imminent move by large Soviet military forces into Poland." Colonel Ryszard Kukliński, a senior officer on the Polish General Staff, was secretly sending reports to the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Richard T. |last=Davies |title=The CIA and the Polish Crisis of 1980–1981 |journal=[[Journal of Cold War Studies]] |year=2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=120–123 |doi=10.1162/1520397041447346 |s2cid=57563775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA transferred around $2&amp;nbsp;million yearly in cash to Solidarity, which suggests that $10&amp;nbsp;million total is a reasonable estimate for the five-year total.

The U.S. Congress authorized the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, and the NED allocated $10&amp;nbsp;million to Solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Domber |first=Gregory F. |title=What Putin Misunderstands about American Power |url=http://uncpressblog.com/2014/08/28/gregory-f-domber-what-putin-misunderstands-about-american-power/ |date=August 28, 2014 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |website=University of California Press Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Polish government launched a crackdown of its own in December 1981, however, Solidarity was not alerted.

===Operation Desert Storm===
{{main|Gulf War}}
During the Iran-Iraq war, the CIA had backed both sides. The CIA had maintained a network of spies in Iran, but in 1989 a CIA mistake compromised every agent they had in there, and the CIA had no agents in Iraq. In the weeks before the [[Invasion of Kuwait]], the CIA downplayed the military buildup. During the war, CIA estimates of Iraqi abilities and intentions flip-flopped and were rarely accurate. In one particular case, the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb. One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter. The CIA didn't know that it was a civilian bomb shelter. In a rare instance, the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles. Congress took away the CIA's role in interpreting spy-satellite photos, putting the CIA's satellite intelligence operations under the auspices of the military. The CIA created its office of military affairs, which operated as "second-echelon support for the Pentagon... answering... questions from military men [like] 'how wide is this road?'"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=428}}

===Fall of the USSR===
{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Fall of the USSR}}
Gorbachev's announcement of the unilateral reduction of 500,000 Soviet troops took the CIA by surprise. Moreover, Doug MacEachin, the CIA's Chief of Soviet analysis, said that even if the CIA had told the President, the NSC, and Congress about the cuts beforehand, it would have been ignored. "We never would have been able to publish it."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=429}} All the CIA numbers on the USSR's economy were wrong. Too often the CIA relied on inexperienced people supposedly deemed experts. Bob Gates had preceded Doug MacEachin as Chief of Soviet analysis, and he had never visited Russia. Few officers, even those stationed in the country, spoke the language of the people on whom they spied. And the CIA could not send agents to respond to developing situations. The CIA analysis of Russia during the Cold War was either driven by ideology, or by politics. [[William J. Crowe]], the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted that the CIA "talked about the Soviet Union as if they weren't reading the newspapers, much less developed clandestine intelligence."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=430}}

===President Clinton===
On January 25, 1993, [[Mir Qazi]] [[1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters|opened fire at the CIA headquarters]] in Langley, Virginia, killing two agents and wounding three others. On February 26, Al-Qaeda terrorists led by [[Ramzi Yousef]] [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|bombed the parking garage]] below the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], killing six people and injuring 1,402 others.

During the [[Bosnian War]], the CIA ignored signs within and without{{Clarify|date=June 2021}} of the [[Srebrenica massacre]]. On July 13, 1995, when the press report about the massacre came out, the CIA received pictures from spy satellite of prisoners guarded by men with guns in Srebrenica.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|last=Weiner|first=Tim|publisher=Anchor Books|year=2008|location=New York, NY|pages=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA had no agents on the ground to verify the report. Two weeks after news reports of the slaughter, the CIA sent a U-2 to photograph it. A week later the CIA completed its report on the matter. The final report came to the Oval Office on August 4, 1995. In short, it took three weeks for the agency to confirm that one of the largest mass murders in Europe since the Second World War had occurred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another CIA mistake which occurred in the Balkans during the Clinton presidency was the NATO bombing of Serbia. To force [[Slobodan Milošević]] to withdraw his troops from Kosovo, the CIA had been invited to provide military targets for bombings, wherein the agency's analysts used tourist maps to determine the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|last=Weiner|first=Tim|publisher=Anchor Books|year=2008|location=New York, NY|pages=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agency incorrectly provided the coordinates of the Chinese Embassy as a target resulting in its bombing. The CIA had misread the target as Slobodan Milosevic 's military depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|last=Weiner|first=Tim|publisher=Anchor Books|year=2008|location=New York, NY|pages=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the CIA had orders for economic intelligence; a female CIA agent revealed her connections to the CIA to the French. [[Dick Holm]], [[Paris]] Station Chief, was expelled.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Guatemala]], the CIA produced the Murphy Memo, based on audio recordings made by [[covert listening device]]s planted by Guatemalan intelligence in the bedroom of Ambassador [[Marilyn McAfee]]. In the recording, Ambassador McAfee verbally entreated "Murphy." The CIA circulated a memo in the highest Washington circles accusing Ambassador McAfee of having an extramarital lesbian affair with her secretary, Carol Murphy. There was no affair. Ambassador McAfee was calling to Murphy, her [[poodle]].{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=459}}

[[Harold James Nicholson]] would burn{{Clarify|date=June 2021}} several serving officers and three years of trainees before he was caught spying for Russia. In 1997 the House would pen another report, which said that CIA officers know little about the language or politics of the people they spy on; the conclusion was that the CIA lacked the "depth, breadth, and expertise to monitor political, military, and economic developments worldwide."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=465}} Russ Travers said in the CIA in-house journal that in five years "intelligence failure is inevitable".{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=466}} In 1997 the CIA's new director [[George Tenet]] would promise a new working agency by 2002. The CIA's surprise at India's detonation of an atom bomb was a failure at almost every level. After the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]] by [[Al Qaeda]], the CIA offered two targets to be [[Operation Infinite Reach|hit in retaliation]]. One of them was the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]], where traces of chemical weapon precursors had been detected. In the aftermath, it was concluded that "the decision to target al Shifa continues a tradition of operating on inadequate intelligence about Sudan." It triggered the CIA to make "substantial and sweeping changes" to prevent "a catastrophic systemic intelligence failure."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=470}} Between 1991 and 1998 the CIA lost 3,000 employees.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====Aldrich Ames====
{{See also|Aldrich Ames}}
Between 1985 and 1986, the CIA lost every spy it had in Eastern Europe. The details of the investigation into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success and has been widely criticized. On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled [[Aldrich Ames]] out of his Jaguar.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=448}} In the investigation that ensued, the CIA [[1995 CIA disinformation controversy|discovered]] that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents. On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected at the time that the sources were compromised, but the information was sent up the chain as genuine.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=450}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/ames/ames.htm |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |title=FBI History: Famous Cases&amp;nbsp;– Aldrich Hazen Ames |access-date=July 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611072859/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/ames/ames.htm |archive-date=June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osama bin Laden===
Agency files show that it is believed [[Osama bin Laden]] was funding the Afghan rebels against the USSR in the 1980s.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=460}} In 1991, bin Laden returned to his native [[Saudi Arabia]] protesting the presence of troops, and [[Operation Desert Storm]]. He was expelled from the country. In 1996, the CIA created a team to hunt bin Laden. They were trading information with the Sudanese until, on the word of a source that would later be found to be a fabricator, the CIA closed its Sudan station later that year. In 1998, bin Laden would declare war on America, and, on August 7, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|strike in Tanzania and Nairobi]]. On October 12, 2000, Al Qaeda [[USS Cole bombing|bombed the USS ''Cole'']]. In the first days of George W. Bush's presidency, Al Qaeda threats were ubiquitous in daily presidential CIA briefings, but it may have become a case of crying wolf.{{Colloquialism|date=June 2021}} The agency's predictions were dire but carried little weight, and the focus of the president and his defense staff were elsewhere. The CIA arranged the arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members through cooperation with foreign agencies, but the CIA could not definitively say what effect these arrests have had, and it could not gain hard intelligence from those captured. The President had asked the CIA if Al Qaeda could plan attacks in the US. On August 6, Bush received a daily briefing with the headline, not based on current, solid intelligence, "Al Qaeda determined to strike inside the US." The US had been hunting bin Laden since 1996 and had had several opportunities, but neither Clinton, nor Bush had wanted to risk taking an active role in a murky assassination plot, and the perfect opportunity had never materialized for a DCI that would have given him the reassurances he needed to take the plunge. That day, [[Richard A. Clarke]] sent [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] warning of the risks, and decrying the inaction of the CIA.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=480}}

====Al-Qaeda and the Global War on Terrorism====

[[File:A bounty leaflect prepared by the USA for use in Afghanistan (front) -a.jpg|thumb|The CIA prepared a series of leaflets announcing bounties for those who turned in or denounced individuals suspected of association with the [[Taliban]] or al Qaeda.]]
The CIA had long been dealing with terrorism originating from abroad, and in 1986 had set up a [[Counterterrorist Center]] to deal specifically with the problem. At first, confronted with secular terrorism, the agency found [[Islamism|Islamist]] terrorism looming increasingly large on its scope.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In January 1996, the CIA created an experimental "virtual station," the [[Bin Laden Issue Station]], under the Counterterrorist Center, to track bin Laden's developing activities. Al-Fadl, who defected to the CIA in spring 1996, began to provide the Station with a new image of the Al Qaeda leader: he was not only a terrorist financier but a terrorist organizer as well. FBI Special Agent Dan Coleman (who together with his partner Jack Cloonan had been "seconded" to the bin Laden Station) called him Qaeda's "[[Rosetta Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Mayer |first=Jane |title=Junior: The clandestine life of America's top Al Qaeda source |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=September 11, 2006 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/11/060911fa_fact?currentPage=all |access-date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, CIA chief George Tenet launched a plan to deal with al-Qaeda. The Counterterrorist Center, its new chief, [[Cofer Black]], and the center's [[Bin Laden Issue Station|bin Laden unit]] were the plan's developers and executors. Once it was prepared, Tenet assigned CIA intelligence chief [[Charles E. Allen]] to set up a "Qaeda cell" to oversee its tactical execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tenet |first1=George |author-link1=George Tenet |last2=Harlow |first2=Bill |author-link2=Bill Harlow |title=At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-114778-4 |pages=119–120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2nSTwbFAh0C&amp;pg=PA119 |oclc= 71163669}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the CIA and [[United States Air Force|USAF]] jointly ran a series of flights over Afghanistan with a small remote-controlled reconnaissance drone, the [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]]; they obtained probable photos of bin Laden. Cofer Black and others became advocates of arming the Predator with missiles to try to assassinate bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders. After the Cabinet-level Principals Committee meeting on terrorism of September 4, 2001, the CIA resumed reconnaissance flights, the drones now being weapons-capable.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====September 11 attacks and its aftermath====
[[File:Cia-mi17.jpg|thumb|right|US Special Forces help Northern Alliance troops away from a CIA-operated MI-17 Hip helicopter at [[Bagram Airbase]], 2002]]
On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 Al-Qaeda members]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four passenger jets within the [[Northeastern United States]] in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks. Two planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], the third into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], and the fourth inadvertently into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]. The attacks cost the [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|lives of 2,996 people (including the 19 hijackers)]], caused the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the Twin Towers]], and damaged the western side of the Pentagon. Soon after 9/11, ''The New York Times'' released a story stating that the CIA's New York field office was destroyed in the wake of the attacks. According to unnamed CIA sources, while [[first responder]]s, military personnel and [[Volunteering|volunteers]] were conducting rescue efforts at the [[World Trade Center site]], a special CIA team was searching the rubble for both digital and paper copies of classified documents. This was done according to well-rehearsed document recovery procedures put in place after the Iranian takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979. While it was not confirmed whether the agency was able to retrieve the classified information, it is known that all agents present that day fled the building safely.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

While the CIA insists that those who conducted the attacks on 9/11 were not aware that the agency was operating at 7 World Trade Center under the guise of another (unidentified) federal agency, this center was the headquarters for many notable criminal terrorism investigations. Though the New York field offices' main responsibilities were to monitor and recruit foreign officials stationed at the United Nations, the field office also handled the investigations of the August 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa and the October 2000 bombing of the USS ''Cole''.&lt;ref name="Risen"&gt;{{cite news |last=Risen |first=James |title=A Nation Challenged: The Intelligence Agency; Secret C.I.A.

According to CIA representatives that spoke with ''The New York Times'', pre-9/11 the agency received approximately 500 to 600 applications a week, in the months following 9/11 the agency received that number daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmitt |first=Eric |title=A Nation Challenged: The Intelligence Agencies; Job Seekers Flood Spy Agencies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/22/us/a-nation-challenged-the-intelligence-agencies-job-seekers-flood-spy-agencies.html |access-date=December 3, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intelligence community as a whole, and especially the CIA, were involved in presidential planning immediately after the 9/11 attacks. In his address to the nation at 8:30pm on September 11, 2001, George W. Bush mentioned the intelligence community: "The search is underway for those who are behind these evil acts, I've directed the full resource of our ''intelligence'' and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and bring them to justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bush |first=George W. |title=President George W.

The involvement of the CIA in the newly coined "War on Terror" was further increased on September 15, 2001. During a meeting at Camp David George W. Bush agreed to adopt a plan proposed by CIA director George Tenet. This plan consisted of conducting a covert war in which CIA paramilitary officers would cooperate with anti-Taliban guerillas inside Afghanistan. They would later be joined by small special operations forces teams which would call in precision airstrikes on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. This plan was codified on September 16, 2001, with Bush's signature of an official Memorandum of Notification that allowed the plan to proceed.&lt;ref name="Public Broadcasting Service"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fighting on Two Fronts: A Chronology |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/etc/cron.html |website=PBS Frontline |access-date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25–27, 2001, Taliban prisoners revolted at the Qala Jangi prison west of Mazar-e-Sharif. Though several days of struggle occurred between the Taliban prisoners and the Northern Alliance members present, the prisoners gained the upper hand and obtained North Alliance weapons. At some point during this period Johnny "Mike" Spann, a CIA officer sent to question the prisoners, was beaten to death. He became the first American to die in combat in the war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Public Broadcasting Service"/&gt;

After 9/11, the CIA came under criticism for not having done enough to prevent the attacks. Tenet rejected the criticism, citing the agency's planning efforts especially over the preceding two years. He also considered that the CIA's efforts had put the agency in a position to respond rapidly and effectively to the attacks, both in the "Afghan sanctuary" and in "ninety-two countries around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tenet |first1=George |last2=Harlow |first2= Bill |title=At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-114778-4 |pages=121–122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2nSTwbFAh0C&amp;q=%22Afghan%20sanctuary%22&amp;pg=PA121 |oclc=71163669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2nSTwbFAh0C&amp;pg=PA177|title=At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA|first1=George|last1=Tenet|first2=Bill|last2=Harlow|date=April 30, 2007|publisher=Harper Collins|via=Google Books|isbn=9780061147784}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new strategy was called the "[[Worldwide Attack Matrix]]".

[[Anwar al-Awlaki]], a Yemeni-American U.S. citizen and al-Qaeda member, was killed on September 30, 2011, by an airstrike conducted by the Joint Special Operations Command. After several days of surveillance of Awlaki by the Central Intelligence Agency, armed drones took off from a new, secret American base in the Arabian Peninsula, crossed into northern Yemen, and fired several [[Hellfire missile]]s at al-Awlaki's vehicle. [[Samir Khan]], a Pakistani-American al-Qaeda member and editor of the jihadist ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' magazine, also reportedly died in the attack. The combined CIA/JSOC drone strike was the first in Yemen since 2002 – there have been others by the military's Special Operations forces – and was part of an effort by the spy agency to duplicate in Yemen the covert war which has been running in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8799295/Same-US-military-unit-that-got-Osama-bin-laden-killed-Anwar-al-Awlaki.html |title=Same US military unit that got Osama bin Laden [sic] killed Anwar al-Awlaki |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=September 30, 2011 |access-date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/world/middleeast/anwar-al-awlaki-is-killed-in-yemen.html |first1=Mark |last1=Mazzetti |author-link1=Mark Mazzetti |first2=Eric |last2=Schmitt |author-link2=Eric P.

====Use of vaccination program in hunt for Osama bin Laden====
The agency attracted widespread criticism after it used a [[Shakil Afridi|local doctor]] in Pakistan to set up a hepatitis B vaccination program in [[Abbottabad]] in 2011 to obtain DNA samples from the occupants of a compound where it was suspected bin Laden was living, hoping to obtain samples from bin Laden or his children in order to confirm his presence. It is unknown whether any useful DNA was acquired from the program, but it was deemed not successful. The doctor was later arrested and sentenced to a lengthy prison term on allegedly unrelated charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna/print|title=CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA|last=Shah|first=Saeed|date=July 11, 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=May 3, 2019|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] criticized the CIA for endangering and undermining trust in medical workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shah |first1=Saeed |title=CIA's fake vaccination programme criticised by Médecins Sans Frontières |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/14/cia-fake-vaccination-medecins-frontieres |access-date=15 May 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the CIA's action had increased resistance to vaccination programs in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Masood |first1=Salman |title=Pakistan's War on Polio Falters Amid Attacks on Health Workers and Mistrust |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/world/asia/pakistan-polio-vaccinations-campaign.html |access-date=15 May 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failures in intelligence analysis===
A major criticism is a failure to forestall the [[September 11 attacks]]. The [[9/11 Commission Report]] identified failures in the IC as a whole. One problem, for example, was the FBI failing to "connect the dots" by sharing information among its decentralized field offices.

The report concluded that former DCI [[George Tenet]] failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by [[al-Qaeda]] prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe |year=2013 |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947–2001 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-80479-336-0 |pages=198–202 |name-list-style=amp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was finished in June 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with Congress, over the objections of current DCI General [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]].

===Abuses of CIA authority, 1970s–1990s===
Conditions worsened in the mid-1970s, around the time of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]].&lt;!-- {{Citation needed |date=June 2009}} --&gt; A dominant feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of the U.S. Presidency and the executive branch of the U.S. government.

Hastening the CIA's fall from grace was the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by former CIA officers, and President [[Richard Nixon]]'s subsequent attempt to use the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation of the burglary. In the famous "smoking gun" recording that led to President Nixon's resignation, Nixon ordered his chief of staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]], to tell the CIA that further investigation of Watergate would ''"open the whole can of worms about the Bay of Pigs"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/history/hpol/nixon/watergate/smoking-gun |website=[[Wyzant]] |title=Transcript of a recording of a meeting between President Richard Nixon and H.

Walters|Vernon Walters]], communicated to FBI Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] that the FBI should not follow the money trail from the burglars to the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]], as it would uncover CIA informants in Mexico. The FBI initially agreed to this due to a long-standing agreement between the FBI and CIA not to uncover each other's sources of information, though within a couple of weeks the FBI demanded this request in writing, and when no such formal request came, the FBI resumed its investigation into the money trail. Nonetheless, when the smoking gun tapes were made public, damage to the public's perception of CIA's top officials, and thus to the CIA as a whole, could not be avoided.&lt;ref name=" Gray III"&gt;{{cite book |title=In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate |last1=Gray III |first1=L.

Repercussions from the [[Iran–Contra affair]] arms smuggling scandal included the creation of the [[Intelligence Authorization Act]] in 1991. It defined covert operations as secret missions in geopolitical areas where the U.S. is neither openly nor engaged. This also required an authorizing chain of command, including an official, [[presidential finding]] report and the informing of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which, in emergencies, requires only "timely notification."

===Iraq War===
{{main|CIA activities in Iraq}}
{{further|Plame affair}}
Seventy-two days after the 9/11 attacks, President Bush told Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] to update the US [[Military operation plan|plan]] for an invasion of [[Iraq]], but not to tell anyone. Rumsfeld asked Bush if he could bring DCI Tenet into the loop, to which Bush agreed.&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=Bob |title=Plan of Attack |url=https://archive.org/details/planofattackdefi00bobw |url-access=registration |date=2004 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=074325547X |page=[https://archive.org/details/planofattackdefi00bobw/page/467 467]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA had put out feelers to Iraq in the form of eight of their best officers in Kurdish territory in Northern Iraq. These officers hit a goldmine, unprecedented in the famously closed Hussein government. By December 2002, the CIA had close to a dozen functional networks in Iraq&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /&gt;{{rp|242}} and would penetrate Iraq's [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]], tap the encrypted communications of the Deputy Prime Minister, and recruit the bodyguard of Hussein's son{{which|date=November 2019}} as an agent. As time passed, the CIA would become more and more frantic about the possibility of their networks being compromised. To the CIA, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] had to occur before the end of February 2003 if their sources inside Hussein's government were to survive. The rollup would happen as predicted, 37 CIA sources recognized by their Thuraya satellite telephones provided for them by the CIA.&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /&gt;{{rp|337}}

[[File:Secretary of Defense Leon E.

The case [[Colin Powell]] presented before the [[United Nations]] (purportedly proving an Iraqi WMD program) was inaccurate. DDCI [[John E. McLaughlin]] was part of a long discussion in the CIA about equivocation. McLaughlin, who would make, among others, the "slam dunk" presentation to the President, "felt that they had to dare to be wrong to be clearer in their judgments".&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /&gt;{{rp|197}} The Al Qaeda connection, for instance, was from a single source, extracted through torture, and was later denied. [[Curveball (informant)|Curveball]] was a known liar, and the sole source for the mobile chemical weapons factories.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=491}} A postmortem of the intelligence failures in the lead up to Iraq led by former DDCI Richard Kerr would conclude that the CIA had been a casualty of the Cold War, wiped out in a way "analogous to the effect of the meteor strikes on the dinosaurs."{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=496}}

[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] that details the use of torture during CIA detention and interrogation.]]
The opening days of the invasion of Iraq would see successes and defeats for the CIA. With its Iraq networks compromised, and its strategic and tactical information shallow, and often wrong, the intelligence side of the invasion itself would be a black eye for the agency. The CIA would see some success with its "Scorpion" paramilitary teams composed of CIA [[Special Activities Division]] agents, along with friendly Iraqi [[Partisan (military)|partisans]]. CIA SAD officers would also help the US [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces]].&lt;ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq |url=https://archive.org/details/operationhotelca00tuck |url-access=registration |first1=Mike |last1=Tucker |first2=Charles |last2=Faddis |year=2008 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=978-1-59921-366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wamu.org/audio/dr/08/10/r2081007-22101.asx |title=An interview on public radio with the author |access-date=March 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930081326/http://wamu.org/audio/dr/08/10/r2081007-22101.asx |archive-date=September 30, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of Iraq would be a low point in the history of the CIA. At the largest CIA station in the world, agents would rotate through 1–3-month tours. In Iraq, almost 500 transient agents would be trapped inside the [[Green Zone]] while Iraq station chiefs would rotate with only a little less frequency.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=493}}

===2004, DNI takes over CIA top-level functions===
The [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]] created the office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide functions that had previously been the CIA's. The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the [[intelligence cycle management|intelligence cycle]]. Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies, and preparation of briefings for the president. On July 30, 2008, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13470]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-13470.htm |title=Executive Order 13470 |website=Federation of American Scientists |access-date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; amending [[Executive Order 12333]] to strengthen the role of the DNI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/bush-orders-intelligence-overhaul/ |title=Bush Orders Intelligence Overhaul |first=Chris |last=Strohm |website=[[Congress Daily]] |date=August 1, 2008 |via=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) oversaw the Intelligence Community, serving as the president's principal intelligence advisor, additionally serving as head of the CIA. The DCI's title now is "Director of the Central Intelligence Agency" (D/CIA), serving as head of the CIA.

Currently, the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence. Before the establishment of the DNI, the CIA reported to the President, with informational briefings to congressional committees. The [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] is a permanent member of the National Security Council, responsible for briefing the President with pertinent information collected by all U.S. intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, etc. All 16 Intelligence Community agencies are under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence.

Under the aegis of operation [[Timber Sycamore]] and other clandestine activities, [[Special Activities Center|CIA operatives]] and [[United States special operations forces|U.S. special operations troops]] have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1&amp;nbsp;billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Secret CIA effort in Syria faces large funding cut |first1=Greg |last1=Miller |first2=Karen |last2=DeYoung |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmakers-move-to-curb-1-billion-cia-program-to-train-syrian-rebels/2015/06/12/b0f45a9e-1114-11e5-adec-e82f8395c032_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA has been sending weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria since at least 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. has secretly provided arms training to Syria rebels since 2012 |first1=David S. |last1=Cloud |first2=Raja |last2=Abdulrahim |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/21/world/la-fg-cia-syria-20130622 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These weapons have been reportedly falling into hands of extremists, such as [[al-Nusra Front]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The terrorists fighting us now?

Sources state that the hold on aid was not related to the transitions from Obama's administration to Trump's, but rather due to issues faced by the FSA. Based on responses by rebel officials, they believe that the aid freeze is related to concerns that weapons and funds will fall into the hands of ISIL. Based on information obtained by Reuters, five FSA groups have confirmed that they received funding and military support from a source called "MOM operations room."{{clarify|date=July 2018}} Several countries besides the U.S., including Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, had also contributed to the funding of the FSA.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=dead link was here before}} On April 6, 2017, Al-Jazeera reported that funding to the FSA was partially restored.

===Reorganization===
On March 6, 2015, the office of the D/CIA issued an unclassified edition of a statement by the Director, titled "Our Agency's Blueprint for the Future," as a press release for public consumption. The press release announced sweeping plans for the reorganization and reform of the CIA, which the Director believes will bring the CIA more in line with the agency doctrine called the 'Strategic Direction.' Among the key changes disclosed include the establishment of a new directorate, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which is responsible for designing and crafting the digital technology to be used by the agency, to keep the CIA always ahead of its enemies. The Directorate of Digital Innovation will also train CIA staff in the use of this technology, to prepare the CIA for the future, and it will also use the technological revolution to deal with cyber-terrorism and other perceived threats. The new directorate will be the chief cyber-espionage arm of the agency going forward.&lt;ref name="PR2015-03-06"&gt;{{cite web |title=Message to the Workforce from CIA Director John Brennan: Our Agency's Blueprint for the Future |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2015-press-releases-statements/message-to-workforce-agencys-blueprint-for-the-future.html |website=Central Intelligence Agency |date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other changes which were announced include the formation of a Talent Development Center of Excellence, the enhancement and expansion of the CIA University and the creation of the office of the Chancellor to head the CIA University to consolidate and unify recruitment and training efforts. The office of the Executive Director will be empowered and expanded, and the secretarial offices serving the Executive Director will be streamlined. The restructuring of the entire Agency is to be revamped according to a new model whereby governance is modeled after the structure and hierarchy of corporations, said to increase the efficiency of workflow and to enable the Executive Director to manage day-to-day activity significantly. As well, another stated intention was to establish 'Mission Centers', each one to deal with a specific geographic region of the world, which will bring the full collaboration and joint efforts of the five Directorates together under one roof. While the Directorate heads will still retain ultimate authority over their respective Directorate, the Mission Centers will be led by an Assistant Director who will work with the capabilities and talents of all five Directorates on mission-specific goals for the parts of the world which they are given responsibility for.&lt;ref name="PR2015-03-06"/&gt;

The unclassified version of the document ends with the announcement that the National Clandestine Service (NCS) will be reverting to its original Directorate name, the Directorate of Operations. The Directorate of Intelligence is also being renamed. It will now be the Directorate of Analysis.&lt;ref name="PR2015-03-06"/&gt;

===Drones===

A new policy introduced by President Barack Obama removed the authority of the CIA to launch drone attacks and allowed these attacks only under [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] command. This change was reversed by President Donald Trump, who authorized CIA drone strikes on suspected terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/03/14/520162910/trump-restores-cia-power-to-launch-drone-strikes |title=Trump Restores CIA Power To Launch Drone Strikes |date=March 14, 2017 |first=David |last=Welna |website=NPR |access-date=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encryption devices sold through front company===
For decades until 2018, the CIA secretly owned [[Crypto AG]], a small Swiss company that made encryption devices, in association with West German intelligence. The company sold compromised encryption devices to over 120 countries, allowing Western intelligence to eavesdrop on communications that the users believed to be secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/national-security/cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage/|title=The CIA secretly bought a company that sold encryption devices across the world.

==Open source intelligence==
{{Further|Foreign Broadcast Information Service|Open Source Center}}
Until the 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community, one of the "services of common concern" that the CIA provided was [[open source intelligence]] from the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Distinction Between Open Information and Secrets |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/Vol49no2/reexamining_the_distinction_3.htm |last=Mercado |first=Stephen |website=Center for the Study of Intelligence |date=April 15, 2007 |access-date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBIS, which had absorbed the Joint Publication Research Service, a military organization that translated documents,&lt;ref name=JPRSharvard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/research/guides/jprs/ |title=Joint Publications Research Service (JPRS) |work=Harvard College Library |access-date=July 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709232005/http://hcl.harvard.edu/research/guides/jprs/ |archive-date=July 9, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; moved into the [[National Open Source Enterprise]] under the Director of National Intelligence.

During the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], [[Michael Sekora]] (assigned to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]), worked with agencies across the intelligence community, including the CIA, to develop and deploy a technology-based competitive strategy system called [[Project Socrates]]. Project Socrates was designed to utilize open source intelligence gathering almost exclusively. The technology-focused Socrates system supported such programs as the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in addition to private sector projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Esther |last=Smith |title=DoD Unveils Competitive Tool: Project Socrates Offers Valuable Analysis |date=May 5, 1988 |magazine=[[Washington Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Robert |last=Wrubel |title=The Frontal Assault: A Conversation with Michael Sekora |date=July 10, 1990 |magazine=[[Financial World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its mandate to gather intelligence, the CIA is looking increasingly online for information, and has become a major consumer of [[social media]]. "We're looking at YouTube, which carries some unique and honest-to-goodness intelligence," said [[Doug Naquin]], director of the DNI [[Open Source Center]] (OSC) at CIA headquarters. "We're looking at chat rooms and things that didn't exist five years ago, and trying to stay ahead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=CIA Monitors YouTube For Intelligence |url=http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206105311 |first=Thomas |last=Claburn |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=February 6, 2008 |access-date=February 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210020649/http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206105311 |archive-date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA launched a [[Twitter]] account in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pfeiffer |first=Eric |url=https://news.yahoo.com/cia-launches-twitter-and-facebook-accounts-210535915.html |title=CIA outwits impersonators by embracing Twitter, Facebook |website=[[Yahoo!

==Outsourcing and privatization==
{{see also|Intelligence Outsourcing}}
Many of the duties and functions of Intelligence Community activities, not the CIA alone, are being outsourced and privatized. [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]], former Director of National Intelligence, was about to publicize an investigation report of outsourcing by U.S. intelligence agencies, as required by Congress.&lt;ref name=IntAuth2008&gt;{{cite web |title=Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Conference Committee Report |date=December 6, 2007|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/2007_rpt/hrpt110-478.pdf |website=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this report was then classified.&lt;ref name="Hillhouse2007-10-09"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070601993_pf.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=R.

* different standards for government employees and contractors;
* contractors providing similar services to government workers;
* analysis of costs of contractors vs. employees;
* an assessment of the appropriateness of outsourced activities;
* an estimate of the number of contracts and contractors;
* comparison of compensation for contractors and government employees;
* attrition analysis of government employees;
* descriptions of positions to be converted back to the employee model;
* an evaluation of accountability mechanisms;
* an evaluation of procedures for "conducting oversight of contractors to ensure identification and prosecution of criminal violations, financial waste, fraud, or other abuses committed by contractors or contract personnel"; and
* an "identification of best practices of accountability mechanisms within service contracts."

According to investigative journalist [[Tim Shorrock]]:

{{quote|text=...what we have today with the intelligence business is something far more systemic: senior officials leaving their national security and counterterrorism jobs for positions where they essentially perform the same jobs they once held at the CIA, the NSA, and other agencies{{snd}}but for double or triple the salary and profit. It's a privatization of the highest order, in which our collective memory and experience in intelligence &amp;ndash; our crown jewels of spying, so to speak &amp;ndash; are owned by corporate America. There is essentially no government oversight of this private sector at the heart of our intelligence empire. And the lines between public and private have become so blurred as to be nonexistent.&lt;ref name="spies for hire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/excerpt/2008/05/29/spies_for_hire/print.html |title=Former high-ranking Bush officials enjoy war profits |last=Shorrock |first=Tim |website=[[Salon.com]] |date=May 29, 2008 |access-date=June 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602013315/http://www.salon.com/news/excerpt/2008/05/29/spies_for_hire/print.html |archive-date=June 2, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="business of intelligence"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/business/15shelf.html |title=The Business of Intelligence Gathering |last=Hurt III |first=Harry |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 15, 2008 |access-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Congress had required an outsourcing report by March 30, 2008.&lt;ref name="Hillhouse2007-12-18"&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA Contractors: Double or Nothin' |url=http://www.thespywhobilledme.com/the_spy_who_billed_me/2007/12/cia-contractors.html |first=R.

{{quote|text=The Director of National Intelligence has been granted the authority to increase the number of positions (FTEs) on elements in the Intelligence Community by up to 10% should there be a determination that activities performed by a contractor should be done by a U.S. government employee."&lt;ref name="Hillhouse2007-12-18"/&gt;}}

The problem is two-fold. Part of the problem, according to Author Tim Weiner, is that political appointees designated by recent presidential administrations have sometimes been under-qualified or over-zealous politically. Large scale purges have taken place in the upper echelons of the CIA, and when those talented individuals are pushed out the door they have frequently gone on to found new independent intelligence companies which can suck up CIA talent.&lt;ref name="Ashes" /&gt; Another part of the contracting problem comes from Congressional restrictions on the number of employees within the IC. According to Hillhouse, this resulted in 70% of the de facto workforce of the CIA's National Clandestine Service being made up of contractors. "After years of contributing to the increasing reliance upon contractors, Congress is now providing a framework for the conversion of contractors into federal government employees{{snd}}more or less."&lt;ref name="Hillhouse2007-12-18"/&gt; The number of independent contractors hired by the Federal government across the intelligence community has skyrocketed. So, not only does the CIA have trouble hiring, but those hires will frequently leave their permanent employ for shorter term contract gigs which have much higher pay and allow for more career mobility.&lt;ref name="Ashes" /&gt;

As with most government agencies, building equipment often is contracted. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), responsible for the development and operation of airborne and spaceborne sensors, long was a joint operation of the CIA and the United States Department of Defense. The NRO had been significantly involved in the design of such sensors, but the NRO, then under DCI authority, contracted more of the design that had been their tradition, and to a contractor without extensive reconnaissance experience, [[Boeing]]. The next-generation satellite [[Future Imagery Architecture]] project "how does heaven look," which missed objectives after $4&amp;nbsp;billion in cost overruns, was the result of this contract.&lt;ref name="AWST2005-03-20"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=SBIRS High in the Red Again |date=March 20, 2005 |first1=Amy |last1=Butler |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/03215p02.xml |journal=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/washington/11satellite.html |title=In Death of Spy Satellite Program, Lofty Plans and Unrealistic Bids |last=Taubman |first=Philip |date=November 11, 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the cost problems associated with intelligence come from one agency, or even a group within an agency, not accepting the compartmented security practices for individual projects, requiring expensive duplication.&lt;ref name=BenRich&gt;{{cite book |title=Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years of Lockheed |first=Ben R. |last=Rich |publisher=Back Bay Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-316-74330-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/skunkworks00benr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, the CIA has been the subject of many controversies, both at home and abroad.

==In fiction==
{{main|CIA in fiction}}
Fictional depictions of the CIA exist in many books, films and video games. Some fiction draws, at least in parts, on actual historical events, while other works are entirely fictional. The television series ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' (2007), was based solely on a man who accidentally sees secret CIA encryptions and eventually becomes an asset/liability, and later on an agent in the agency. Films include ''[[Charlie Wilson's War (film)|Charlie Wilson's War]]'' (2007), based on the story of U.S. Congressman [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] and CIA operative [[Gust Avrakotos]], who supported the Afghan [[mujahideen]], and ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'' (2006), a fictional spy film produced and directed by [[Robert De Niro]] based loosely on the development of [[counter-intelligence]] in the CIA.
