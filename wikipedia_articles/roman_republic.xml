{{Politics of Ancient Rome}}

The '''Roman Republic''' ({{lang-la|Rēs pūblica Rōmāna}} {{IPA-la|ˈreːs ˈpuːblika roːˈmaːna|}}), officially the '''Senate and People of Rome''' ({{Lang-la|Senatus Populusque Romanus}}), was a state of the [[ancient Rome|classical Roman civilization]], run through [[res publica|public]] [[Representation (politics)|representation]] of the [[Roman people]]. Beginning with the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|overthrow]] of the [[Roman Kingdom]] (traditionally dated to 509 BC) and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]], Rome's control rapidly expanded during this period—from the city's immediate surroundings to [[hegemony]] over the entire [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean world]].

Roman society under the [[Republic]] was primarily a cultural mix of Latin and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] societies, as well as of Sabine, Oscan, and Greek cultural elements, which is especially visible in the [[List of Roman deities|Roman Pantheon]]. Its political organization developed at around the same time as direct democracy in Ancient Greece, with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by [[Roman Senate|a senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. VII part 2, pp. 110, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The top magistrates were the two [[Roman consul|consuls]], who had an extensive range of executive, legislative, judicial, military, and religious powers. Even though a small number of powerful families (called ''[[Gens|gentes]]'') monopolised the main magistracies, the Roman Republic is generally considered one of the earliest examples of representative democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2018-07-06|title=Roman Republic|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/roman-republic/|access-date=2020-11-05|website=National Geographic Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Roman Republic {{!}} History, Government, Map, &amp; Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Republic|access-date=2020-11-05|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Roman Government|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Roman_Government/|access-date=2020-11-05|website=[[World History Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of [[Promagistrate|promagistracies]] to rule its conquered [[Roman province|provinces]], or the composition of the senate.

Unlike the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' of the Roman Empire, the Republic was in a state of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence. Its first enemies were its [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] neighbours as well as the [[Gauls]], who even [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|sacked the city]] in 387 BC. The Republic nonetheless demonstrated extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses, however catastrophic. After the Gallic Sack, Rome conquered the whole Italian peninsula in a century, which turned the Republic into a major power in the Mediterranean. The Republic's greatest enemy was doubtlessly [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], against which it waged [[Punic Wars|three wars]]. The [[Punics|Punic]] general [[Hannibal]] famously invaded Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] and inflicted on Rome two devastating defeats at [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], but the Republic once again recovered and won the war thanks to [[Scipio Africanus]] at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC. With Carthage defeated, Rome became the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world. It then embarked on a long series of difficult conquests, after having notably defeated [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and [[Perseus of Macedon]], [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] [[Viriathus]], the [[Numidia]]n [[Jugurtha]], the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], the [[Gaul]] [[Vercingetorix]], and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] queen [[Cleopatra]].

At home, the Republic similarly experienced a long streak of social and political crises, which ended in several violent civil wars. At first, the [[Conflict of the Orders]] opposed the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], the closed oligarchic elite, to the far more numerous ''plebs'', who finally achieved political equality in several steps during the 4th century BC. Later, the vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society, as the immense influx of slaves they brought enriched the aristocracy, but ruined the peasantry and urban workers. In order to address this issue, several social reformers, known as the ''[[Populares]]'', tried to pass agrarian laws, but the [[Gracchi|Gracchi brothers]], [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus|Saturninus]], or [[Clodius Pulcher]] were all murdered by their opponents, the ''[[Optimates]]'', keepers of the traditional aristocratic order. Mass slavery also caused three [[Servile Wars]]; the last of them was led by [[Spartacus]], a skilful gladiator who ravaged Italy and left Rome powerless until his defeat in 71 BC. In this context, the last decades of the Republic were marked by the rise of great generals, who exploited their military conquests and the factional situation in Rome to gain control of the political system. [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] (between 105 and 86 BC), then [[Sulla]] (between 82 and 78 BC) dominated in turn the Republic; both used extraordinary powers to purge their opponents. These multiple tensions led to a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]]; the first between the two generals [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]]. Despite his victory and appointment as [[Roman dictator|dictator for life]], Caesar [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|was slain]] in 44 BC. Caesar's heir [[Octavian]] and lieutenant [[Mark Antony]] [[Battle of Philippi|defeated]] Caesar's assassins [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in 42 BC, but then turned against each other. The final defeat of Mark Antony alongside his ally and lover [[Reign of Cleopatra|Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, and the Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to [[Octavian]] as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' in 27 BC – which effectively made him the first [[Roman emperor]] – thus ended the Republic.

==History==
===Foundation (509 BC)===
{{main|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}
Rome had been ruled by [[Roman Kingdom|monarchs]] since its [[Founding of Rome|foundation]]. These monarchs were elected, for life, by men who made up the [[Roman Senate]]. The last Roman monarch was named [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (colloquially known as "Tarquin the Proud") and in traditional histories Tarquin was expelled from Rome in 509 BC because his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius]], raped a noblewoman named [[Lucretia]] (who had afterwards taken her own life). The father of Lucretia, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], together with Tarquin the Proud's nephew, [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], mustered support from the Senate and [[Roman army]] and forced the former monarch into exile to [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215–218: Cornell offers a summary of "Livy's prose narrative" and derived literary works relating to the expulsion of the kings.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Dionysius of Halicarnassus|p=iv. 64–85}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livius|Livy]], i. 57–60&lt;/ref&gt;

After this incident, the Senate agreed to abolish kingship. In turn, most of the former functions of the king were transferred to two separate [[Roman consul|consuls]]. These consuls were elected to office for a term of one year, each was capable of acting as a "check" on his [[Collegiality#Collegiality in the Roman Republic|colleague]] (if necessary) through the power of ''[[veto]]'' that the former kings had held. Furthermore, if a consul were to abuse his powers in office, he could be prosecuted when his term expired. Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus became first consuls of the Roman Republic (despite Collatinus' role in the creation of the Republic, he belonged to the same family as the former king and thus was forced to abdicate his office and leave Rome. He thereafter was replaced as co-consul by [[Publius Valerius Publicola]].)&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 226–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern scholarship describes these events as the quasi-mythological detailing of an aristocratic coup within Tarquin's own family, not a popular revolution. They fit a narrative of a personal vengeance against a tyrant leading to his overthrow, which was common among Greek cities, and such a pattern of political vengeance was theorized by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', 5.1311a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215–218, 377–378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', VII, part 2, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome in Latium (509–387 BC)===
====Early campaigns====
According to Rome's traditional histories, Tarquin made several attempts to retake the throne, including the [[Tarquinian conspiracy]], which involved Brutus' own sons, the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars#War with Veii and Tarquinii, after the overthrow of the monarchy in 509 BC|war with Veii and Tarquinii]] and finally the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars#War with Clusium in 508 BC|war between Rome and Clusium]]; but none succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Capitoline Brutus Musei Capitolini MC1183.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|The "[[Capitoline Brutus]]", a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] possibly depicting [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who led the revolt against Rome's last king and was a founder of the Republic|alt=|left]]

The first Roman republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] towns and villages, or else tribal [[Sabines]] from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their [[Etruria|Etruscan]] rulers. Rome defeated the Latin cities in the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] in 496, the [[Battle of Mount Algidus]] in 458, the [[Battle of Corbio]] in 446, the Battle of Aricia, however it suffered a significant defeat at the [[Battle of the Cremera]] in 477 wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of [[Veii]].&lt;ref name="epitomeB1C12"&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historyP37"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Campaignbox Rome's Early Italian Campaigns}}By the end of this period, Rome had effectively [[Roman conquest of Italy|completed the conquest]] of their immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours, and also secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the nearby Apennine hill tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. II&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plebeians and patricians====
{{Main|Conflict of the Orders}}
Beginning with their revolt against Tarquin, and continuing through the early years of the Republic, Rome's patrician aristocrats were the dominant force in politics and society. They initially formed a closed group of about 50 large families, called [[Gens|''gentes'']], who monopolised Rome's magistracies, state priesthoods and senior military posts. The most prominent of these families were the [[Cornelia gens|Cornelii]],{{efn-lr|Throughout the Republic, the Cornelii held 75 consulships and 27 consular tribuneships, almost 10% of all the consulships of the period.}} followed by the [[Aemilia gens|Aemilii]], [[Claudia gens|Claudii]], [[Fabia gens|Fabii]], and [[Valeria gens|Valerii]]. The power, privilege and influence of leading families derived from their wealth, in particular from their landholdings, their position as [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patrons]], and their numerous clients.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 289–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of Roman citizens were commoners of various social degrees. They formed the backbone of Rome's economy, as smallholding farmers, managers, artisans, traders, and tenants. In times of war, they could be summoned for military service. Most had little direct political influence over the Senate's decisions or the laws it passed, including the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the consular system. During the early Republic, the ''[[plebs]]'' (or plebeians) emerged as a self-organised, culturally distinct group of commoners, with their own internal hierarchy, laws, customs, and interests.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 256–259: ''Plebs'' ("the mass") was originally a disparaging term, but was adopted as a badge of pride by those whom it was meant to insult. It might not have referred to wealthier commoners.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plebeians had no access to high religious and civil office,{{efn-lr|Several historians, notably [[Tim Cornell]], have challenged this view, saying that in the early Republic the [[Fasti Consulares]] bear names that are distinctively plebeian. Therefore, they claim that the plebeians were only excluded from higher offices by the Decemvirate in 451 BC. More recently, [[Corey Brennan]] has dismissed this theory, arguing that the consular plebeians would not have let the Decemvirs take their power away that easily (cf. ''The Praetorship'', pp. 24, 25). He explains the "plebeian" names in the Fasti by some patrician gentes who later died out, or lost their status. Consequently, this article follows the traditional narrative that the plebeians were excluded from the start.}} and could be punished for offences against laws of which they had no knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; For the poorest, one of the few effective political tools was their withdrawal of labour and services, in a "''[[secessio plebis]]''"; they would leave the city en masse, and allow their social superiors to fend for themselves. The [[First secessio plebis|first such secession]] occurred in 494, in protest at the abusive treatment of plebeian debtors by the wealthy during a famine.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional date for the first secession is given by Livy as 494; many other dates have been suggested, and several such events probably took place: see Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215–218, 256–261, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate was compelled to give them direct access to the written civil and religious laws, and to the [[Elections in the Roman Republic|electoral]] and political process. To represent their interests, the ''plebs'' elected [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes]], who were personally [[Sacrosanctity|sacrosanct]], immune to [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]] by any magistrate, and had [[veto]] power over the passage of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the duties and legal status of plebeian tribunes and aediles, see Andrew Lintott, ''Violence in Republican Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKEpOP4lLIC&amp;pg=PA92 pp. 92–101].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic invasion of Italy (390–387 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Roman-Gallic Wars}}
By 390, several [[Gauls|Gallic tribes]] were invading Italy from the north. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the [[Senones]],&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'', i. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the [[Battle of the Allia|Battle of Allia River]] around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, led by the chieftain [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off.

===Roman expansion in Italy (387–272 BC)===

====Wars against Italian neighbours====
[[File:Roman conquest of Italy.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map showing Roman expansion in [[Italy]]]]
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
{{Campaignbox Samnite Wars}}
From 343 to 341, Rome won [[First Samnite war|two battles]] against their [[Samnites|Samnite]] neighbours, but were unable to consolidate their gains, due to the outbreak of war with former Latin allies.

In the [[Latin War]] (340–338), Rome defeated a coalition of Latins at the battles of [[Battle of Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] and the [[Battle of Trifanum|Trifanum]]. The Latins submitted to Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Second Samnite War]] began in 327.&lt;ref name="historyOfRomeP52"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated, but from 314, Rome was dominant, and offered progressively unfavourable terms for peace. The war ended with Samnite defeat at the [[Battle of Bovianum]] (305). By the following year, Rome had annexed most Samnite territory and began to establish colonies there; but in 298 the Samnites rebelled, and defeated a Roman army, in a [[Third Samnite War]]. Following this success they built a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of Populonia]] in 282 Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.

====Rise of the plebeian nobility====
In the 4th century, plebeians gradually obtained political equality with patricians. The starting point was in 400, when the first plebeian consular tribunes were elected; likewise, several subsequent consular colleges counted plebeians (in 399, 396, 388, 383, and 379). The reason behind this sudden gain is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;It has nevertheless been speculated that [[Lucius Atilius Luscus]] in 444, and [[Quintus Antonius Meranda]] in 422 were also plebeian. cf. Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was limited as patrician tribunes retained preeminence over their plebeian colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; In 385, the former consul and saviour of the besieged Capitol [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] is said to have sided with the plebeians, ruined by the Sack and largely indebted to patricians. The issue of debt relief for the plebs remained indeed pressing throughout the century. Livy tells that Capitolinus sold his estate to repay the debt of many of them, and even went over to the plebs, the first patrician to do so. Nevertheless, the growing unrest he had caused led to his trial for seeking kingly power; he was sentenced to death and thrown from the [[Tarpeian Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vi. 11, 13–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 331, 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 376 and 367, the tribunes of the plebs [[Gaius Licinius Stolo]] and [[Lucius Sextius Lateranus]] continued the plebeian agitation and pushed for an ambitious legislation, known as the ''[[Leges Liciniae Sextiae]]''. Two of their bills attacked patricians' economic supremacy, by creating legal protection against indebtedness and forbidding excessive use of public land, as the ''[[Ager publicus]]'' was monopolised by large landowners. The most important bill opened the consulship to plebeians.&lt;ref name="Cornell, p. 337."&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 337. Cornell explains that Livy confused the contents of the ''Lex Licinia Sextia'' of 366 the ''Lex Genucia'' of 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tribunes controlled by the patricians vetoed the bills, but Stolo and Lateranus retaliated by vetoing the elections for five years while being continuously re-elected by the plebs, resulting in a stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;Livy mentions at least two patricians favourable to the tribunes: [[Marcus Fabius Ambustus (consular tribune 381)|Marcus Fabius Ambustus]], Stolo's father-in-law, and the dictator for 368 [[Publius Manlius Capitolinus]], who appointed the first plebeian ''magister equitum'', Gaius Licinius Calvus.&lt;/ref&gt; In 367, they carried a bill creating the ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Decemviri sacris faciundis]]'', a college of ten priests, of whom five had to be plebeians, thereby breaking patricians' monopoly on priesthoods. Finally, the resolution of the crisis came from the dictator [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]], who made a compromise with the tribunes: he agreed to their bills, while they in return consented to the creation of the offices of praetor and curule aediles, both reserved to patricians. Lateranus also became the first plebeian consul in 366; Stolo followed in 361.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vi. 36–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 108–114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, plebeians were able to hold both the [[roman dictator|dictatorship]] and the censorship, since former consuls normally filled these senior magistracies. The four time consul [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] became the first plebeian dictator in 356 and censor in 351. In 342, the tribune of the plebs Lucius Genucius passed his ''[[Leges Genuciae]]'', which abolished interest on loans, in a renewed effort to tackle indebtedness, required the election of at least one plebeian consul each year, and prohibited a magistrate from holding the same magistracy for the next ten years or two magistracies in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0154%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D42 vii. 42].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell, p. 337." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 65–67, where he shows that the ten-year rule was only temporary at this time.&lt;/ref&gt; In 339, the plebeian consul and dictator [[Quintus Publilius Philo]] passed three laws extending the powers of the plebeians. His first law followed the ''Lex Genucia'' by reserving one censorship to plebeians, the second made plebiscites binding on all citizens (including patricians), and the third stated that the Senate had to give its prior approval to plebiscites before becoming binding on all citizens (the ''Lex Valeria-Horatia'' of 449 had placed this approval after the vote).&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 342, 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Publilius ran for the praetorship, probably in a bid to take the last senior magistracy closed to plebeians, which he won.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, ''The Praetorship'', pp. 68, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RomaTempioRotondoForoBoarioJPG.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], Rome, built in the mid 2nd century BC, most likely by [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]], who won the [[Achaean War]]|208x208px]]

During the early republic, senators were chosen by the consuls from among their supporters. Shortly before 312, the ''[[Lex Ovinia]]'' transferred this power to the censors, who could only remove senators for misconduct, thus appointing them for life. This law strongly increased the power of the Senate, which was by now protected from the influence of the consuls and became the central organ of government.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 393, 394. Cornell gives an earlier date, before 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humm, ''[https://books.openedition.org/efr/1613#bodyftn15 Appius Claudius Caecus]'', pp. 185–226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 312, following this law, the patrician censor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] appointed many more senators to fill the new limit of 300, including descendants of freedmen, which was deemed scandalous. He also incorporated these freedmen in the rural tribes.{{efn-lr|The urban poor were registered in the four urban tribes, whilst the 31 other tribes were composed of landowners, who therefore had the majority in the [[Tribal Assembly]]. Humm thinks that Caecus actually did not appointed "freedmen" in the Senate, but chose new Roman citizens from the recently conquered cities in Italy.}}{{efn-lr|Appius Caecus is a complex character whose reforms are difficult to interpret. For example, Mommsen considered he was a revolutionary, but was puzzled by his opposition to the ''Lex Ogulnia'', which contradicts his previous "democratic" policies. Taylor on the contrary thought he defended patricians' interests, as freedmen remained in the clientele of their patrons. More recently, Humm described his activity as the continuation of the reforms undertaken since Stolo and Lateranus.}} His tribal reforms were nonetheless cancelled by the next censors, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]], his political enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Voting Districts'', pp. 132–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Caecus also launched a vast construction program, building the first aqueduct (''[[Aqua Appia]]''), and the first Roman road (''[[Via Appia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bruce MacBain, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/638505 Appius Claudius Caecus and the Via Appia]", in ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 30, No. 2 (1980), pp. 356–372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 300, the two tribunes of the plebs Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius passed the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'', which created four plebeian pontiffs, therefore equalling the number of patrician pontiffs, and five plebeian augurs, outnumbering the four patricians in the college.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Conflict of the Orders ended with the last secession of the plebs in about 287. The details are not known precisely as Livy's books on the period are lost. Debt is once again mentioned by ancient authors, but it seems that the plebs revolted over the distribution of the land conquered on the Samnites.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Maddox, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41532825 The Economic Causes of the Lex Hortensia]", in ''Latomus'', T. 42, Fasc. 2 (Apr.–Jun. 1983), pp. 277–286.&lt;/ref&gt; A dictator named [[Quintus Hortensius]] was appointed to negotiate with the plebeians, who had retreated to the [[Janiculum|Janiculum hill]], perhaps to dodge the draft in the war against the [[Lucanians]]. Hortensius passed the ''Lex Hortensia'' which re-enacted the law of 339, making plebiscites binding on all citizens, but also removed the Senate's prior approval to plebiscites. Popular assemblies were by now sovereign; this put an end to the crisis, and to plebeian agitation for 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;R. Develin, "'[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4430760 Provocatio" and Plebiscites]'. Early Roman Legislation and the Historical Tradition", in ''Mnemosyne'', Fourth Series, Vol. 31, Fasc. 1 (1978), pp. 45–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events were a political victory of the wealthy plebeian elite who exploited the economic difficulties of the plebs for their own gain, hence why Stolo, Lateranus, and Genucius bound their bills attacking patricians' political supremacy with debt-relief measures. They had indeed little in common with the mass of plebeians; Stolo was notably fined for having exceeded the limit on land occupation he had fixed in his own law.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7-2, pp. 340, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the end of the patrician monopoly on senior magistracies, many small patrician ''gentes'' faded into history during the 4th and 3rd centuries due to the lack of available positions; the [[Verginia gens|Verginii]], [[Horatia gens|Horatii]], [[Menenia gens|Menenii]], [[Cloelia gens|Cloelii]] all disappear, even the [[Julia gens|Julii]] entered a long eclipse. They were replaced by plebeian aristocrats, of whom the most emblematic were the [[Caecilia gens|Caecilii]] Metelli, who received 18 consulships until the end of the Republic; the [[Domitia gens|Domitii]], [[Fulvia gens|Fulvii]], [[Licinia gens|Licinii]], [[Marcia gens|Marcii]], or [[Sempronia gens|Sempronii]] were as successful. About a dozen remaining patrician ''gentes'' and twenty plebeian ones thus formed a new elite, called the ''[[nobiles]]'', or ''Nobilitas''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC)====
[[File:Pyrrhus_route.jpg|thumb|Route of Pyrrhus in Italy and Sicily]] [[File:Pyrrhus MAN Napoli Inv6150 n03.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Pyrrhus, found in the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples Archaeological Museum]]. Pyrrhus was a brave and chivalrous general who fascinated the Romans, hence his presence in a Roman house.&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;]]By the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome had established herself as the major power in Italy, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]: [[Carthage]] and the Greek kingdoms.&lt;ref name="historyOrRomeP78"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 282, several Roman warships entered the harbour of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], thus breaking a treaty between the Republic and the Greek city, which forbade the [[Gulf of Taranto|Gulf]] to Roman navy. It triggered a violent reaction from the Tarentine democrats, who sank some of the ships; they were in fact worried that Rome could favour the oligarchs in the city, as it had done with the other Greek cities under its control. The Roman embassy sent to investigate the affair was insulted and war was promptly declared.{{Sfn|Dionysius of Halicarnassus|p=xix. 5, 6}} Facing a hopeless situation, the Tarentines (together with the Lucanians and Samnites) appealed for military aid to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], the very ambitious king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]]. A cousin of [[Alexander the Great]], he was eager to build an empire for himself in the western Mediterranean, and saw Tarentum's plea as a perfect opportunity towards this goal.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 456, 457.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Campaignbox Pyrrhic War}}Pyrrhus and his army of 25,500 men (and 20 war elephants) landed in Italy in 280; he was immediately named ''[[Autokrator|Strategos Autokrator]]'' by the Tarentines. [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], the consul sent to face him, rejected the king's negotiation offer, as he had more troops and hoped to cut the invasion short. The Romans were nevertheless defeated at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]], as their cavalry were afraid of the elephants of Pyrrhus, who lost a large portion of his army. Pyrrhus then marched on Rome, but could not take any Roman city on his way; facing the prospect of being flanked by the two consular armies, he moved back to Tarentum. His adviser, the orator [[Cineas]], made a peace offer before the Roman Senate, asking Rome to return the land it took from the Samnites and Lucanians, and liberate the Greek cities under its control. The offer was rejected after [[Appius Claudius Caecus|Appius Caecus]] (the old censor of 312) spoke against it in a celebrated speech, which was the earliest recorded by the time of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute]]'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 18, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 466–471.&lt;/ref&gt; In 279, Pyrrhus met the consuls [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] and [[Publius Sulpicius Saverrio]] at the [[Battle of Asculum]], which remained undecided for two days, as the Romans had prepared some special chariots to counter his elephants. Finally, Pyrrhus personally charged into the melee and won the battle, but [[Pyrrhic victory|at the cost of an important part of his troops]]; he allegedly said "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined."{{Sfn|Dionysius of Halicarnassus|p=xx. 3}}&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pyrrhus'', 21 § 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, x. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-lr|There are significant differences between the accounts of Cassius Dio, Dionysius, and Plutarch, but the latter's is traditionally followed in the academic literature.}}

He escaped the Italian deadlock by answering a call for help from Syracuse, which tyrant Thoenon was desperately fighting an invasion from [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. Pyrrhus could not let them take the whole island as it would have compromised his ambitions in the western Mediterranean and so declared war on them. At first, his Sicilian campaign was an easy triumph; he was welcomed as a liberator in every Greek city on his way, even receiving the title of king (''[[basileus]]'') of Sicily. The Carthaginians lifted the [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] before his arrival, but he could not entirely oust them from the island as he failed to take their fortress of [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Franke, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 473–480.&lt;/ref&gt; His harsh rule, especially the murder of Thoenon, whom he did not trust, soon led to a widespread antipathy among the Sicilians; some cities even defected to Carthage. In 275, Pyrrhus left the island before he had to face a full-scale rebellion.{{Sfn|Dionysius of Halicarnassus|p=xx. 8.}} He returned to Italy, where his Samnite allies were on the verge of losing the war, despite their earlier victory at the [[Battle of the Cranita hills|Cranita hills]]. Pyrrhus again met the Romans at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]]; this time the consul [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]] was victorious, and even captured eight elephants. Pyrrhus then withdrew from Italy, but left a garrison in Tarentum, and waged a new campaign in Greece against [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos Gonatas]]. His death in battle at [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] in 272 forced Tarentum to surrender to Rome. Since it was the last independent city of Italy, Rome now dominated the entire Italian peninsula, and won an international military reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dinastie della grecia occidentale, hieron II, 32 litri di siracusa, 274-216 ac ca.JPG|thumb|Coin of [[Hiero II of Syracuse]]]]

Rome and [[Carthage]] were initially on friendly terms; [[Polybius]] details three treaties between them, the first dating from the first year of the Republic, the second from 348. The last one was an alliance against Pyrrhus.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, iii. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, vii. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 517–537.&lt;/ref&gt; However, tensions rapidly built up after the departure of the Epirote king. Between 288 and 283, [[Messina]] in Sicily was taken by the [[Mamertines]], a band of mercenaries formerly employed by [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]]. They plundered the surroundings until [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the new tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], defeated them (in either 269 or 265). Carthage could not let him take Messina, as he would have controlled its [[Strait of Messina|Strait]], and garrisoned the city. In effect under a Carthaginian protectorate, the remaining Mamertines appealed to Rome to regain their independence. Senators were divided on whether to help them or not, as it would have meant war with Carthage, since Sicily was in its sphere of influence (the treaties furthermore forbade the island to Rome), and also [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. A supporter of the war, the consul [[Appius Claudius Caudex]] ([[Appius Claudius Caecus|Caecus]]' brother) turned to the [[Tribal Assembly]] to get a favourable vote, by notably promising booty to voters.&lt;ref&gt;Which assembly was consulted has led to many discussions in the academic literature. Goldsworthy favours the Centuriate Assembly, cf. ''The Punic Wars'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caudex first secured control of the city with ease. However, Syracuse and Carthage, at war for centuries, made an alliance to counter the invasion and blockaded Messina, but Caudex defeated Hiero and Carthage separately.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, i. 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Hayes Scullard|H. H. Scullard]] thinks that Caudex was not successful, since he did not receive a triumph and was succeeded in command by Messalla, his political enemy. Cf. ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla|Manius Valerius Corvinus Messalla]] landed with a strong 40,000 men army that conquered eastern Sicily, which prompted Hiero to shift his allegiance and forge a long lasting alliance with Rome. In 262, the Romans moved to the southern coast and besieged [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. In order to raise the siege, Carthage sent reinforcements, including 60 elephants – the first time they used them, but still lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|battle]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] before, Rome could not take all of Sicily because Carthage's naval superiority prevented them from effectively besieging coastal cities, which could receive supplies from the sea. Using a captured Carthaginian ship as blueprint, Rome therefore launched a massive construction program and built 100 [[quinquereme]]s in only two months, perhaps through an [[assembly line]] organisation. They also invented a new device, the ''[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]'', a grappling engine which enabled a crew to board on an enemy ship.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The consul for 260 [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Scipio Asina]] lost the first [[Battle of the Lipari Islands|naval skirmish]] of the war against [[Hannibal Gisco]] at [[Lipari|Lipara]], but his colleague [[Gaius Duilius|Gaius Dullius]] won a [[Battle of Mylae|great victory]] at [[Milazzo|Mylae]]. He destroyed or captured 44 ships, and was the first Roman to receive a naval triumph, which also included captive Carthaginians for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Carthage was victorious on land at [[Battle of Thermae|Thermae]] in Sicily, the ''corvus'' made Rome invincible on the waters. The consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]] (Asina's brother) captured [[Corsica]] in 259; his successors won the naval battles of [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] in 258, [[Battle of Tyndaris|Tyndaris]] in 257, and [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]] in 256.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 548–554.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Corvus.svg|alt=|left|thumb|Diagram of a ''corvus'']]In order to hasten the end of the war, the consuls for 256 decided to carry the operations to Africa, on Carthage's homeland. The consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] landed on the [[Cap Bon]] peninsula with about 18,000 soldiers. He captured the city of [[Siege of Aspis|Aspis]], then repulsed Carthage's counter-attack at [[Battle of Adys|Adys]], and took [[Tunis]]. The Carthaginians supposedly sued him for peace, but his conditions were so harsh that they continued the war instead. They hired Spartan mercenaries, led by [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], to command their troops.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In 255, the Spartan general marched on Regulus, still encamped at Tunis, who accepted the battle to avoid sharing the glory with his successor. However, the flat land near Tunis favoured the Punic elephants, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|which crushed the Roman infantry on the Bagradas plain]]; only 2,000 soldiers escaped, and Regulus was captured. The consuls for 255 nonetheless won a new sounding naval victory at Cape Hermaeum, where they captured 114 warships. This success was spoilt by a storm that annihilated the victorious navy: 184 ships of 264 sank, 25,000 soldiers and 75,000 rowers drowned. The ''corvus'' considerably hindered ships' navigation, and made them vulnerable during tempest. It was abandoned after another similar catastrophe took place in 253 (150 ships sank with their crew). These disasters prevented any significant campaign between 254 and 252.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 554–557.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|Denarius of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C. Caecilius Metellus Caprarius]], 125 BC. The reverse depicts the triumph of his great-grandfather [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius]], with the elephants he had captured at [[Battle of Panormus|Panormos]]. The elephant had thence become the emblem of the powerful [[Caecilia gens|Caecilii]] Metelli.{{Sfnp|Crawford|1974|pp=292, 293}}]]

Hostilities in Sicily resumed in 252, with the taking of Thermae by Rome. Carthage countered the following year, by besieging [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], who held [[Palermo|Panormos]] (now Palermo). The consul had dug trenches to counter the elephants, which once hurt by missiles turned back on their own army, resulting in a [[Battle of Panormus|great victory]] for Metellus, who exhibited some captured beasts in the [[Circus Maximus|Circus]]. Rome then besieged the last Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily, [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] and [[Drepana]], but these cities were impregnable by land. [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]], the consul of 249, recklessly tried to take the latter from the sea, but he suffered a terrible [[Battle of Drepana|defeat]]; his colleague [[Lucius Junius Pullus (consul 249 BC)|Lucius Junius Pullus]] likewise lost his fleet off [[Siege of Lilybaeum (250 BC)|Lilybaeum]]. Without the ''corvus'', Roman warships had lost their advantage. By now, both sides were drained and could not undertake large scale operations; the number of Roman citizens who were being called up for war had been reduced by 17% in two decades, a result of the massive bloodshed. The only military activity during this period was the landing in Sicily of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 247, who harassed the Romans with a mercenary army from a citadel he built on [[Monte Erice|Mt. Eryx]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 559–564.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, unable to take the Punic fortresses in Sicily, Rome tried to win the decision at sea and built a new navy, thanks to a forced borrowing on the rich. In 242, the 200 quinqueremes of the consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] blockaded Drepana. The rescue fleet from Carthage arrived the next year, but was largely undermanned and [[Battle of the Aegates|soundly defeated]] by Catulus. Exhausted and unable to bring supplies to Sicily, Carthage sued for peace. Catulus and Hamilcar negotiated a treaty, which was somewhat lenient to Carthage, but the Roman people rejected it and imposed harsher terms: Carthage had to pay 1000 [[Talents of silver|talents]] immediately and 2200 over ten years, and evacuate Sicily. The fine was so high that Carthage could not pay Hamilcar's mercenaries, who had been shipped back to Africa. They revolted during the [[Mercenary War]], which Carthage had enormous difficulties to suppress. Meanwhile, Rome took advantage of a similar revolt in [[Sardinia]] to seize the island from Carthage, in violation of the peace treaty. This stab-in-the-back led to permanent bitterness in Carthage, and [[revanchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 565–569.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Punic War (218–201 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Second Punic War}}
After its victory, the Republic shifted its attention to its northern border as the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] were threatening Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Carthage compensated the loss of Sicily and Sardinia with the [[Barcid conquest of Hispania|conquest]] of Southern [[Hispania]] (up to [[Salamanca]]), and its rich silver mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; This enterprise was the work of the [[Barcid family]], headed by [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], the former commander in Sicily. Hamilcar nonetheless died against the [[Oretani]] in 228; his son-in-law [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] – the founder of [[Carthago Nova]] – and his three sons [[Hannibal]], [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and [[Mago Barca|Mago]], succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage was an oligarchy at the time, dominated by the Barcids. The Roman historian [[Fabius Pictor]] thought that the Barcids conquered Spain without approval from the Carthaginian government; a view rejected by Polybius. cf. Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid expansion worried Rome, which concluded a treaty with Hasdrubal in 226, stating that Carthage could not cross the [[Ebro river]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 216–219.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city of [[Saguntum]], located in the south of the Ebro, appealed to Rome in 220 to act as arbitrator during a ''[[Stasis (political history)|stasis]]''. Hannibal dismissed Roman rights on the city, and took it in 219.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; At Rome, the [[Cornelii]] and the [[Aemilii]] considered the capture of Saguntum a ''casus belli'',&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 37. These ''gentes'' had interests in [[Marseille|Massalia]] and other Greek cities of the western Mediterranean. Massalia was concerned by the Carthaginian growing influence in Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; and won the debate against [[Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]], who wanted to negotiate. An embassy carrying an ultimatum was sent to Carthage, asking its senate to condemn Hannibal's deeds. The Carthaginian refusal started the Second Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Second Punic War full-en.svg|alt=|left|thumb|422x422px|Principal offensives of the war: Rome (red), Hannibal (green), Hasdrubal (purple)]]

Initially, the plan of the Republic was to carry war outside Italy, by sending the consuls [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] to Hispania, and [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BCE)|Sempronius Longus]] to Africa, while their naval superiority prevented Carthage from attacking from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was thwarted by Hannibal's bold move to Italy. In May 218, he indeed crossed the Ebro with a large army of about 100,000 soldiers and 37 elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Fronda, ''Companion to the Punic Wars'', pp. 251, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; He passed in [[Gaul]], [[Battle of Rhone Crossing|crossed the Rhone]], then the [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|Alps]], possibly through the [[Col de Clapier]] (2,491 meters high).&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This famous exploit cost him almost half of his troops,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxi. 38, quoting [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius Alimentus]] who reported a personal discussion with Hannibal, in which he said he lost 38,000 men by crossing the Alps.&lt;/ref&gt; but he could now rely on the Boii and Insubres, still at war with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Publius Scipio, who had failed to block Hannibal on the Rhone, sent his elder brother [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus]] with the main part of his army in Hispania according to the initial plan, and went back to Italy with the rest to resist Hannibal in Italy, but he was defeated and wounded near [[Battle of Ticinus|Pavia]].

Hannibal then marched south and won three outstanding victories. The first one was on the banks of the [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] in December 218, where he defeated the other consul Sempronius Longus thanks to his brother Mago, who had concealed some elite troops behind the legions and attacked them from the rear once fighting Hannibal. More than half of the Roman army was lost. Hannibal then ravaged the country around [[Arezzo|Arretium]] to lure the new consul [[Gaius Flaminius]] into a trap, at the [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]]. He had hidden his troops in the hills surrounding the lake and attacked Flaminius when he was cornered on the shore. This [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|clever ambush]] resulted in the death of the consul and the complete destruction of his army of 30,000 men. In 216, the new consuls [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro|Terentius Varro]] mustered the biggest army possible, with eight legions (more than 80,000 soldiers) – twice as many as the Punic army – and confronted Hannibal, who was encamped at [[Cannae]], in [[Apulia]]. Despite his numerical disadvantage, Hannibal used his heavier cavalry to rout the Roman wings and envelop their infantry, whom he annihilated. In terms of casualties, the [[Battle of Cannae]] was the worst defeat in the history of Rome: only 14,500 soldiers escaped; Paullus was killed as well as 80 senators.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius (iii. 117) gives 70,000 dead. Livy (xxii. 49) gives 47,700 dead and 19,300 prisoners.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Boii ambushed the army of the consul-elect for 215, [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Postumius Albinus]], who died with all his army of 25,000 men in the [[Battle of Silva Litana|Forest of Litana]].

[[File:Carthage, quarter shekel, 237-209 BC, SNG BM Spain 102.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|quarter shekel]] of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain. The obverse may depict [[Hannibal]] under the traits of young [[Melqart]]. The reverse features one of his famous war elephants.&lt;ref&gt;''Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, Great Britain, Volume IX, British Museum, Part 2: Spain'', London, 2002, n° 102.&lt;/ref&gt;|221x221px]]These disasters triggered a wave of defection among Roman allies, with the rebellions of the Samnites, Oscans, Lucanians, and Greek cities of Southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 52, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In Macedonia, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] also made an [[Macedonian–Carthaginian Treaty|alliance]] with Hannibal in order to take [[Illyria]] and the area around [[Epidamnos|Epidamnus]], occupied by Rome. His attack on [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] started the [[First Macedonian War]]. In 215, [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] died of old age, and his young grandson [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] broke the long alliance with Rome to side with Carthage. At this desperate point, the aggressive strategy against Hannibal advocated by the Scipiones was abandoned in favour of delaying tactics that avoided direct confrontation with him. Its main proponents were the consuls Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, nicknamed ''Cunctator'' ("the delayer"), [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Claudius Marcellus]], and [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 237 BC)|Fulvius Flaccus]]. The "[[Fabian strategy|Fabian Strategy]]" favoured a slow reconquest of the lost territories, since Hannibal could not be everywhere to defend them.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', pp. 49, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he remained invincible on the battlefield, defeating all the Roman armies on his way, he could not prevent Claudius Marcellus from taking Syracuse in 212 after a [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|long siege]], nor the fall of his bases of Capua and Tarentum in [[Siege of Capua (211 BC)|211]] and [[Battle of Tarentum (209 BC)|209]]. However, in 208 the consuls Claudius Marcellus and Quinctius Crispinus were ambushed and killed near [[Venusia]].

In Hispania, the situation was overall much better for Rome. This theatre was mostly commanded by the brothers Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, who won the battles of [[Battle of Cissa|Cissa]] in 218, soon after Hannibal's departure, and [[Battle of Dertosa|Dertosa]] against his brother Hasdrubal in 215, which enabled them to conquer the eastern coast of Hispania. In 211 however, Hasdrubal and Mago Barca successfully returned the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian tribes]] that supported the Scipiones, and attacked them simultaneously at the [[Battle of the Upper Baetis]], in which the Scipiones brothers died.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Publius' son, the future [[Scipio Africanus]], was then elected with a special proconsulship to lead the Hispanic campaign. He soon showed outstanding skills as a commander, by winning a series of battles with ingenious tactics. In 209, he took [[Battle of Cartagena (209 BC)|Carthago Nova]], the main Punic base in Hispania, then defeated Hasdrubal at the [[Battle of Baecula]] (208).&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After his defeat, Hasdrubal was ordered by Carthage to move to Italy. Since he could not use ships, he followed the same route as his brother through the Alps, but this time the surprise effect was gone. The consuls [[Marcus Livius Salinator|Livius Salinator]] and [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Claudius Nero]] were awaiting him and won the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], where Hasdrubal died.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the turning point of the war. The attrition campaign had indeed worked well: Hannibal's troops were now depleted; he only had one elephant left ([[Surus]]) and retreated to [[Calabria|Bruttium]], on the defensive. In Greece, Rome contained Philip V without devoting too many forces, by setting an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]], [[Sparta]], and [[Pergamon]], which also prevented Philip from aiding Hannibal. The war resulted in a stalemate, with the [[Treaty of Phoenice]] signed in 205.
{{Campaignbox First Macedonian War}}

In Hispania, Scipio continued his triumphal campaign at the battles of [[Battle of Carmona|Carmona]] in 207, and [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] (now [[Seville]]) in 206, which ended the Punic threat on the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Elected consul in 205, he convinced the Senate to cancel the Fabian Strategy, and instead to invade Africa by using the support of the Numidian king [[Masinissa|Massinissa]], who had defected to Rome. Scipio landed in Africa in 204. He took [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Utica]], then won the [[Battle of the Great Plains]], which prompted Carthage to recall Hannibal from Italy and open peace negotiations with Rome. The talks nevertheless failed because Scipio wanted to impose harsher terms on Carthage, in order to avoid it from rising again as a threat to Rome. Hannibal was therefore sent to face Scipio at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]]. Scipio could now use the heavy Numidian cavalry of Massinissa – which had hitherto been so successful against Rome – to rout the Punic wings, then flank the infantry, as Hannibal had done at Cannae. Defeated for the first time, Hannibal convinced the Carthaginian Senate to pay the war indemnity, which was even harsher than that of 241: 10,000 talents in 50 instalments. Carthage furthermore had to give up all its elephants, all its fleet but ten [[trireme]]s, all its possessions outside its core territory in Africa (what is now [[Tunisia]]), and could not declare war without the authorisation of Rome. In effect, Carthage was condemned to be a minor power, while Rome recovered from a desperate situation to dominate the Western Mediterranean.

Rome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] of the kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], located in the north of the [[Greek peninsula]], to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome.&lt;ref name="enemiesP47"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historyP115"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet.&lt;ref name="enemiesP47"/&gt; The [[First Macedonian War]] saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of preoccupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.

The past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire: [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]]. In 202, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt's position, thereby disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p42"&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies. Doubting Rome's strength (a reasonable doubt, given Rome's performance in the [[First Macedonian War]]) Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the [[Second Macedonian War]].&lt;ref name="enemiesP49"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army. In 197, the Romans decisively defeated Philip at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]], and Philip was forced to give up his recent Greek conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans declared the "Peace of the Greeks", believing that Philip's defeat now meant that Greece would be stable. They pulled out of Greece entirely, maintaining minimal contacts with their Greek allies.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

With Egypt and Macedonia weakened, the [[Seleucid Empire]] made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Now not only Rome's allies against Philip, but even Philip himself, sought a Roman alliance against the Seleucids.&lt;ref name="historyP119"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was made worse by the fact that [[Hannibal]] was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid emperor, and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of Greece, but of Rome itself.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The Seleucids were much stronger than the Macedonians had ever been, because they controlled much of the former Persian Empire, and by now had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great's former empire.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt;

[[File:Escipión africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Roman portraiture|Roman bronze bust]] of [[Scipio Africanus]], dated mid 1st century BC, and found in the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] (Inv. No. 5634).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but pulling out of recently pacified Spain and Gaul.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt; They even established a major garrison in [[Sicily]] in case the Seleucids ever got to [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt; This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war.&lt;ref name="Eckstein, Arthur p52"/&gt; A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, [[Scipio Africanus]], and set out for Greece, beginning the [[Roman–Seleucid War]]. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Battle of Thermopylae]] (as they believed the [[300 Spartans]] had done centuries earlier).&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt; Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece.&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt; The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the [[Hellespont]], which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt; The decisive engagement was fought at the [[Battle of Magnesia]], resulting in a complete Roman victory.&lt;ref name="historyP119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conquest of Greece (172–146 BC)====
[[File:Tony robert-fleury, l'ultimo giorno di corinto, ante 1870.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Scene of the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]]: last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the Greek city of [[Corinth]]. ''The last day on Corinth'', [[Tony Robert-Fleury]], 1870]]
In 179 Philip died.&lt;ref name="historyP120"&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; His talented and ambitious son, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], took the throne and showed a renewed interest in conquering Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; With her Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the [[Third Macedonian War]]. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168&lt;ref name="historyP120"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced now that the Greeks (and therefore the rest of the region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The [[Fourth Macedonian War]], 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second battle of Pydna]].

The [[Achaean League]] chose this moment to fight Rome but was swiftly defeated. In 146 (the same year as the destruction of [[Carthage]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]] was besieged and destroyed in the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]], which led to the league's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;History of Rome – The republic, Isaac Asimov.&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].

====Third Punic War (149–146 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Third Punic War}}
Carthage never recovered militarily after the Second Punic War,&lt;ref&gt;Pennell, ''Ancient Rome'', Ch. XV, para. 24&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly did so economically and the [[Third Punic War]] that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission after the neighbouring Numidians allied to Rome robbed/attacked Carthaginian merchants. Treaties had forbidden any war with Roman allies, and defence against robbing/pirates was considered as "war action": Rome decided to annihilate the city of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged.&lt;ref name="punicP339"&gt;Goldsworthy, ''The Punic Wars'', p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Romans demanded complete surrender and removal of the city into the (desert) inland far off any coastal or harbour region, and the Carthaginians refused. The city was [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149–146 BC)|besieged, stormed, and completely destroyed]].

Ultimately, all of Carthage's North African and Iberian territories were acquired by Rome. Note that "Carthage" was not an 'empire', but a league of Punic colonies (port cities in the western Mediterranean) like the 1st and 2nd Athenian ("Attic") leagues, under leadership of Carthage. Punic Carthage was gone, but the other Punic cities in the western Mediterranean flourished under Roman rule.

===Social troubles and first civil war (146–60 BC)===
[[Rise of Rome|Rome's rapid expansion]] destabilized its social organization and triggered unrest in the heart of the Republic, which ultimately led to political violence, unrest in the provinces, and ultimately a breakdown in the traditional social relations of Rome that created the Augustan Empire. The period is marked by the rise of strongmen ([[Gaius Marius|Marius]], [[Sulla]], [[Pompey]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], and [[Julius Caesar]]), who turned military success into political power.

====The Gracchi (133–121 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Servile Wars}}
{{Main|Gracchi}}

In 135, the first slave uprising, known as the [[First Servile War]], broke out in Sicily. After initial successes, the slaves led by [[Eunus]] and [[Cleon (Roman rebel)|Cleon]] were annihilated by the consul [[Publius Rupilius]] in 132 BC.

In this context, [[Tiberius Gracchus]] was elected tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the [[Plebeian Council]], but the law was vetoed by a tribune named [[Marcus Octavius]]. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to [[impeach]] Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 96"&gt;Abbott, 96&lt;/ref&gt; His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates&lt;ref name="Hillsborough"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Paul|title=Rome: Transition from Republic to Empire|url=http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf|publisher=Hillsborough Community College|access-date=19 February 2014|archive-date=24 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025245/http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.

Tiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in 123. [[Gaius Gracchus]]' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 97"&gt;Abbott, 97&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, for example, the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a
''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' ("ultimate decree of the senate"). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support.&lt;ref&gt;Stobart, J.C. (1978). "III". In Maguinness, W.S; Scullard, H.H. The Grandeur That was Rome (4th ed.). Book Club Associates. pp. 75–82.&lt;/ref&gt; He stood for election to a third term in 121, but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on Capitoline Hill in Rome.&lt;ref name="Hillsborough" /&gt;

In 121, the province of Gallia Narbonensis was established after the victory of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] over a coalition of Arverni and Allobroges in southern Gaul in 123. The city of Narbo was founded there in 118 by [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]].

====Rise of Marius====
{{Campaignbox Jugurthine War}}
[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Gaius Marius]], instigator of the [[Marian reforms]]]]

The [[Jugurthine War]] of 111–104 was fought between Rome and [[Jugurtha]] of the North African kingdom of [[Numidia]]. It constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa,&lt;ref name="stormingP29"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia,&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''The Jugurthine War'', XII&lt;/ref&gt; a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.

[[Jugurtha]] is shown captive on the right.{{Sfnp|Crawford|1974|pp=449–451}}]]

In 118, King [[Micipsa]] of [[Numidia]] (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was succeeded by two legitimate sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I|Hiempsal]], and an illegitimate son, [[Jugurtha]]. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, turned on his brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated a division of the country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, [[Gaius Marius]], a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 100"&gt;Abbott, 100&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[populares]]'' party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.

{{Campaignbox Cimbrian War}}
The [[Cimbrian War]] (113–101) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes of the ''[[Cimbri]]'' and the ''[[Teutons]]''&lt;ref name="appianS6"&gt;Appian, ''History of Rome'', §6&lt;/ref&gt; migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories,&lt;ref name="enemiesP75"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and clashed with Rome and her allies.&lt;ref name="stormingP6"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] and the [[Battle of Vercellae]] both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.

====Sulla's Civil Wars====
{{Campaignbox Ancient Unification of Italy}}
{{Campaignbox First Mithridatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Sulla's Second Civil War}}
In 91 the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy when the allies complained that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Although they lost militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.

The internal unrest reached its most serious state, however, in the [[Sulla's civil wars|two civil wars]] that were caused by the clash between generals [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] starting from 88, when a Roman army was sent to put down an emerging Asian power, king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. The army, however, was not defeated and won. One of Marius' old quaestors, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], had been elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the "''[[populares]]''" party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic ("''[[optimates]]''") party, brought his army back to Italy and [[Sulla's civil wars|marched on Rome]]. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 103"&gt;Abbott, 103&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to his war against Mithridates. With Sulla gone, the ''populares'' under Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] soon took control of the city.

During the period in which the ''populares'' party controlled the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 106"&gt;Abbott, 106&lt;/ref&gt; They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. 

In 83, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. In the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]]&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the [[Roman Empire]]. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical ''popular'' reforms, was naturally tyrannical. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 104"&gt;Abbott, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Sulla made himself dictator, passed a [[Constitutional reforms of Sulla|series of constitutional reforms]], resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as consul. He died in 78.

====Pompey's dominance====
{{see also|Second Catilinarian conspiracy}}

The [[Third Servile War|third]] and final slave uprising was the most serious,&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; involving ultimately between 120,000&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars, 1, 117&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; slaves under the command of the gladiator [[Spartacus]].

{{Campaignbox Third Mithridatic War}}
[[Mithridates the Great]] was the ruler of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]],&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C5"&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a large kingdom in [[Asia Minor]] (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom,&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C5"/&gt; and Rome for its part seemed equally eager for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring.&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In 88, Mithridates ordered the killing of a majority of the 80,000 Romans living in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the [[First Mithridatic War]]. The Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, [[Gaius Marius]]. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.

The [[Second Mithridatic War]] began when Rome tried to annex a province that Mithridates claimed as his own. In the [[Third Mithridatic War]], first [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] and then [[Pompey the Great]] were sent against Mithridates and his [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian]] ally [[Tigranes the Great]].&lt;ref name="classicalworldP363"&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time [[Battle of the Lycus]].&lt;ref name = "Plutarch"&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives'', Pompey&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Rome against the Cilician Pirates}}
The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates,&lt;ref name = "Plutarch"/&gt; largely from [[Cilicia]].&lt;ref name="epitomeB3C6"&gt;Florus, ''The Epitome of Roman history'', Book 3, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The pirates not only strangled shipping lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia. Pompey was nominated as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates.&lt;ref name="classicalworldP363"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Plutarch"/&gt; It took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates and restore communication between Iberia (Spain), Africa, and Italy.

In 77, the senate sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] ("Pompey the Great"), to put down an [[Sertorian War|uprising in Hispania]]. By 71, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], had just put down the [[Spartacus]]-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the ''populares'' party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 108"&gt;Abbott, 108&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to forge an agreement with the ''populares'' party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly rolled back most of Sulla's constitution.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 109"&gt;Abbott, 109&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|A Roman marble bust of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], Musei Capitolini, Rome]]

Around 66, a movement to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 109-110"&gt;Abbott, 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]]. The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 110"&gt;Abbott, 110&lt;/ref&gt; The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome,&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 111"/&gt; and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63. The consul for the year, [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.

The most important result of the Catilinarian conspiracy was that the ''populares'' party became discredited. The prior 70 years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature of the conspiracy, in conjunction with the senate's skill in disrupting it, did a great deal to repair the senate's image.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 111"&gt;Abbott, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triumvirates and end of the Republic (60–27 BC)===

====First Triumvirate (60–50 BC)====
{{Ancient Rome and the fall of the Republic}}
{{Main|First Triumvirate}}
[[File:Pompeius.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Roman marble head of [[Pompey]] (now in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]])]]
In 62, [[Pompey]] returned victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, refused to ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when [[Julius Caesar]] returned from a governorship in Spain in 61, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], established a private agreement, now known as the [[First Triumvirate]]. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 112"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's consular colleague in 59, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], was an extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 112"&gt;Abbott, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] to the tribunate for 58. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 113"&gt;Abbott, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Gallic Wars]]
{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}
During his term as praetor in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's contemporary [[Julius Caesar]] defeated two local tribes in battle.&lt;ref name="livescaesar"&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives'', Caesar&lt;/ref&gt; After his term as consul in 59, he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans).&lt;ref name="livescaesar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his [[Gallic Wars]], fought between 58 and 49.

Caesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 and 57. In 55 and 54 he made [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|two expeditions into Britain]], the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the [[Battle of Alesia]],&lt;ref name="stormingP62"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 62 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands.

Clodius formed armed gangs that terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey's followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by [[Titus Annius Milo]]. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC)|Ahenobarbus]] ran for the consulship in 55 promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years.
Beginning in the summer of 54, a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 114"&gt;Abbott, 114&lt;/ref&gt; This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo.

In 53, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes,&lt;ref name="enemiesP133"&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; he marched his army deep into the desert;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'', p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar. In 51, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.

====Caesar's Civil War and dictatorship (49–44 BC)====
{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}

{{Main|Caesar's Civil War}}

On 1 January 49, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 115"&gt;Abbott, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49, the senate passed a ''senatus consultum ultimum'', which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts.

On 10 January, Caesar with his veteran army crossed the river [[Rubicon]], the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, in violation of Roman laws, and by the spring of 49 swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed. Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''The Civil War'', 81–92 See also: Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 227 See also: Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, ''Rubicon'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.

Pompey's death did not end the civil war, as Caesar's many enemies fought on. In 46 Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately came back to defeat the Pompeian army of [[Metellus Scipio]] in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Hispania. Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the [[Battle of Munda]].

With Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to achieve undisputed control over the government. The powers which he gave himself were later assumed by his imperial successors.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 134"/&gt; His assumption of these powers decreased the authority of Rome's other political institutions.

Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134"&gt;Abbott, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 48, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46, Caesar was given censorial powers,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt; which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900.&lt;ref name = "Abbott, 137"/&gt; This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to them for election, as well as all bills for enactment. Thus, the group became powerless and were unable to oppose him.{{clarify|date=January 2019}}&lt;!-- how did asking for their consent on everything make them powerless?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbott, 138"&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caesar's assassination ====
{{Main|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}
Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law that allowed him to appoint all magistrates, and later all consuls and tribunes. This transformed the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger, a group of senators led by [[Gaius Cassius]] and [[Marcus Brutus]] hatched a conspiracy and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated Caesar]] at a meeting of the Senate on 15 March 44.&lt;ref name="antiquityP170"&gt;Cantor, ''Antiquity'', p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms in favor of the landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation.

The civil wars that followed destroyed what was left of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133"&gt;Abbott, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assassination, Caesar's three most important supporters, [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] (Mark Antony), Caesar's co-consul, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavianus]] (Octavian), Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]], Caesar's ''[[magister equitum]]'', formed an alliance. Known as the [[Second Triumvirate]],&lt;ref name="Goldsworthy, p. 237"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goldsworthy |first=Adrian |title=In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire |date=2003 |isbn=9780297846666 |page=237 |author-link=Adrian Goldsworthy}}&lt;/ref&gt; they held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus did likewise soon afterwards.

}}

Following Philippi, Rome's territories were divided between the triumvirs but the agreement was fragile and could not withstand internal jealousies and ambitions. Antony detested Octavian and spent most of his time in the East, while Lepidus favoured Antony but felt himself obscured by both his colleagues. Following the defeat of the [[Sicilian revolt]], led by [[Sextus Pompey]], a dispute between Lepidus and Octavian regarding the allocation of lands broke out. Octavian accused Lepidus of usurping power in Sicily and of attempted rebellion and, in 36 BC, Lepidus was forced into exile in [[Circeii]] and stripped of all his offices except that of [[Pontifex Maximus]]. His former provinces were awarded to Octavian. 

Antony, meanwhile, married Caesar's lover, [[Cleopatra]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then launched a campaign against Antony.&lt;ref name="antiquityP170"/&gt; Another [[Last war of the Roman Republic|civil war]] subsequently broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war culminated in the latter's [[Battle of Actium|defeat at Actium]] in 31 BC; Octavian's forces would then chase Antony and Cleoptra to [[Battle of Alexandria (30 BC)|Alexandria]], where they would both [[Death of Cleopatra|commit suicide]] in 30 BC.

Octavian was granted a series of special powers including sole "imperium" within the city of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military victory, since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command. In 27 Octavian was granted the use of the names "Augustus", indicating his primary status above all other Romans, "Princeps", which he used to refer to himself as in public, and he adopted the title "Imperator Caesar" making him the first Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name="grandP7"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Luttwak |first=Edward |title=The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century CE to the Third |date=1976 |isbn=9780801818639 |page=7 |author-link=Edward Luttwak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional system==
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Republic|History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
{{further|Elections in the Roman Republic}}
The constitutional history of the Roman Republic began with the revolution which overthrew the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] in 509 BC, and ended with constitutional reforms that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. The Constitution of the Roman Republic was a constantly-evolving, unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, by which the government and its politics operated.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 161"&gt;Byrd, 161&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the history of the Republic, changes in the constitution were driven by [[Conflict of the Orders|conflicts of interest]] between the aristocracy and ordinary citizens.

===Senate===
{{Main|Senate of the Roman Republic}}
The [[Senate of the Roman Republic|senate's]] ultimate authority derived from the esteem and prestige of the senators.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 96"&gt;Byrd, 96&lt;/ref&gt; This esteem and prestige was based on both precedent and custom, as well as the caliber and reputation of the senators. The senate passed decrees, which were called ''senatus consulta''. These were officially "advice" from the senate to a magistrate. In practice, however, they were usually followed by the magistrates.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 44"&gt;Byrd, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. This was due to the senate's explicit power over the state's budget and in military affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bleiken |first1=Jochen |title=Die Verfassung der römischen Republik |date=1995 |publisher=UTB |location=Schöningh |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making. Its members were usually appointed by [[Roman Censors]], who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. During times of military emergency, such as the civil wars of the 1st century, this practice became less prevalent, as the [[Roman Dictator]], [[Triumvir]] or the senate itself would select its members. Towards the end of the Republic, the senate could enact a ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' in times of emergency, instead of appointing a dictator.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Your explanation here}}

===Legislative assemblies===
[[File:Forum Romanum through Arch of Septimius Severus Forum Romanum Rome.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Forum]], the commercial, cultural, religious, and political center of the city and the Republic which housed the various offices and meeting places of the government]]

{{Main|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic}}

The legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called "optimo jure." The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|two types of legislative assemblies]]. The first was the ''comitia'' ("committees"),&lt;ref name="Lintott, 42"&gt;Lintott, 42&lt;/ref&gt; which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the ''concilia'' ("councils"), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo jure.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 251"&gt;Abbott, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens were organized on the basis of centuries and [[Tribe of Rome|tribes]], which would each gather into their own assemblies. The [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Centuries|Comitia Centuriata]] ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had the ''imperium'' powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 257"&gt;Abbott, 257&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.

The assembly of the tribes (i.e., the citizens of Rome), the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic#Assembly of the Tribes|Comitia Tributa]], was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 51"&gt;Lintott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 77"&gt;Taylor, 77&lt;/ref&gt; Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, [[Curule seat|curule]] [[aedile]]s, and military tribunes.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 7"&gt;Taylor, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Plebeian Council&lt;ref name="Abbott, 196"&gt;Abbott, 196&lt;/ref&gt; was identical to the assembly of the tribes, but excluded the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal.

===Magistrates===
{{Main|Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic}}
Each republican magistrate held certain [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic#Powers|constitutional powers]]. Each was assigned a ''provincia'' by the Senate. This was the scope of that particular office holder's authority. It could apply to a geographic area or to a particular responsibility or task.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 101"&gt;Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The powers of a magistrate came from the people of Rome (both plebeians ''and'' patricians).&lt;ref name="Lintott, 95"&gt;Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[imperium]]'' was held by both consuls and praetors. Strictly speaking, it was the authority to command a military force. In reality, however, it carried broad authority in the other public spheres such as diplomacy, and the justice system. In extreme cases, those with the imperium power were able to sentence Roman Citizens to death. All magistrates also had the power of ''coercitio'' (coercion). This was used by magistrates to maintain public order by imposing punishment for crimes.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 97"&gt;Lintott, ''Constitution of the Roman Republic'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power could also be used to obstruct political opponents.

One check on a magistrate's power was called ''Collega'' (collegiality). Each magisterial office would be held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was ''provocatio''. While in Rome, all citizens were protected from coercion, by ''provocatio'', which was an early form of [[due process]]. It was a precursor to ''[[habeas corpus]]''. If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to [[Cursus honorum|wait ten years]] before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their ''imperium'' extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a [[promagistrate]]), without officially holding that office.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 113"&gt;Lintott, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman consul|consuls]] of the Roman Republic were the highest ranking ordinary magistrates. Each served for one year.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, 20&lt;/ref&gt; They retained several elements of the former kingly regalia, such as the ''[[toga praetexta]]'', and the ''[[fasces]]'', which represented the power to inflict physical punishment. Consular powers included the kings' former "power to command" (''[[imperium]]'') and appointment of new senators. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government. They would preside over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 179"&gt;Byrd, 179&lt;/ref&gt; His authority abroad would be nearly absolute. [[Praetor]]s administered civil law&lt;ref name="Byrd, 32"&gt;Byrd, 32&lt;/ref&gt; and commanded provincial armies. Every five years, two [[Roman Censor|censors]] were elected for an 18-month term, during which they would conduct a [[census]]. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate, or purge them from the senate.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 26"&gt;Byrd, 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aediles]] were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The [[quaestor]]s would usually assist the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.

Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were [[sacrosanct]]. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. It was a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to otherwise interfere with him.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 23"&gt;Byrd, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In times of military emergency, a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] would be appointed for a term of six months.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 24"&gt;Byrd, 24&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.

{{Main|Structural history of the Roman military}}
Rome's military secured Rome's territory and borders, and helped to impose tribute on conquered peoples. Rome's armies had a formidable reputation; but Rome also "produced [its] share of incompetents"&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of Rome's greatest enemies, such as [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Hannibal]],&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; to win early battles but lose the war.

===Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)===
{{Main|Phalanx}}
During this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the [[Etruscans]] to the north,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves are believed to have copied [[phalanx formation|their style of warfare]] from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the [[phalanx formation]] into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, [[Servius Tullius]] (ruled 578–534).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Dionysius of Halicarnassus|p=iv. 16–18}}

The phalanx was effective in large, open spaces, but not on the hilly terrain of the central [[Italian peninsula]]. In the 4th century, the Romans replaced it with the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to [[Marcus Furius Camillus]] and placed shortly after the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasion]] of 390; more likely, it was copied from Rome's [[Samnium|Samnite]] enemies to the south,&lt;ref&gt;''Early Roman Armies'', pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Samnite Wars|Second Samnite War]] (326–304).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |title=Rome, The Samnite Wars |publisher=History-world.org |access-date=3 October 2010 |archive-date=14 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014004107/http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipular legion (c. 315–107 BC)===
[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing (centre-right) two Roman foot-soldiers c. 122 BC. Note the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino-style helmets]] with horsehair plume, [[chain mail]] cuirasses with shoulder reinforcement, oval shields with calfskin covers, ''[[gladius]]'' and ''[[pilum]].'']]

During this period, an army formation of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light infantry) was known as a legion. The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience.&lt;ref&gt;Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. They were typically deployed into three discrete lines based on the three [[heavy infantry]] types:

# The first line maniple were the ''[[hastati]]'', leather-armoured infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a bronze helmet adorned with 3 feathers approximately {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two throwing spears.
# The second line were the ''[[principes]]''. They were armed and armoured in the same manner as the hastati, but wore a lighter coat of mail rather than a solid brass breastplate.
# The ''[[triarii]]'' formed the third line. They were the last remnant of the hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured like the ''principes'', with the exception that they carried a lighter spear.&lt;ref name="polybiusB6"&gt;PolybiusB6&lt;/ref&gt;

The three infantry classes&lt;ref name="santosuossoP18"&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.

The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.&lt;ref name="santosuossoP18"/&gt; The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.

Rome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the [[Socii]], such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in ''alae'', or ''wings'', roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.

[[File:Togatus Barberini 2392.PNG|thumb|upright|The "[[Togatus Barberini]]", depicting a Roman senator holding the ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'' ([[effigies]]) of deceased ancestors in his hands; marble, late 1st century BC; head (not belonging): mid 1st century BC]]
A small navy had operated at a fairly low level after about 300, but it was massively upgraded about forty years later, during the [[First Punic War]]. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.&lt;ref name="websterP156"&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 217, near the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]], Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,&lt;ref name="gabbaP9"&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it did not have to do in the past.

The distinction between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)===
{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}
In a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], Roman consul [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 107, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.&lt;ref name="SantosuossoP29"&gt;Santosuosso, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat "acquired a stronger and more elevated position"&lt;ref name="gabbaP25"&gt;Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; within the state.

The legions of the late Republic were almost entirely heavy infantry. The main legionary sub-unit was a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' of approximately 480 infantrymen, further divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuries]] of 80 men each.&lt;ref name="luttwakP14"&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Each century comprised 10 "tent groups" of 8 men. Cavalry were used as scouts and dispatch riders, rather than as battlefield forces.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops.&lt;ref name="luttwakP15"&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The army's most obvious deficiency lay in its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the East, Rome's slow-moving infantry legions were often confronted by fast-moving cavalry-troops, and found themselves at a tactical disadvantage.

''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]''. II.49.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following Rome's subjugation of the Mediterranean, its navy declined in size although it would undergo short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. [[Julius Caesar]] assembled a fleet to cross the [[English Channel]] and invade ''[[Britannia]]''. [[Pompey]] raised a fleet to deal with the [[Cilicia]]n pirates who threatened Rome's Mediterranean trading routes. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.&lt;ref name="websterP156"/&gt;

==Social structure==
{{Main|Social class in ancient Rome}}
Citizen families were headed by the family's oldest male, the ''[[pater familias]]'', who was lawfully entitled to exercise complete authority (''[[patria potestas]]'') over family property and all family members. Brutus, co-founder of the Republic, is supposed to have exercised the extreme form of this right when he executed his own sons for treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship offered legal protection and rights, but citizens who offended Rome's traditional [[Mos maiorum|moral code]] could be declared [[Infamia|infamous]], and lose certain legal and social privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship was also taxable, and undischarged debt was potentially a capital offence. A form of limited, theoretically voluntary slavery (debt bondage, or [[nexum]]) allowed wealthy creditors to negotiate payment of debt through bonded service. Poor, landless citizens of the lowest class (''proletarii'') might contract their sons to a creditor, patron or third party employer to obtain an income, or to pay off family debts. ''Nexum'' was only abolished when slave labour became more readily available, most notably during the Punic wars.&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 238, 379–380, citing Livy, 9. 46. 13–14 for the poorest citizens as ''forensis facto... humillimi'' (the "lowest of the low").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alföldy, Geza, ''The Social History of Rome'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BM GR 1867.5-8.55 - 01.JPG|thumb|An inscribed [[Roman funerary art|funerary relief]] of Aurelius Hermia and his wife Aurelia Philematum, [[Slavery in ancient Rome|former slaves]] who married after their manumission, 80 BC, from a tomb along the [[Via Nomentana]] in Rome]]

Slaves were simultaneously family members and family property. They could be bought, sold, acquired through warfare, or born and raised within their master's household,. They could also buy their freedom with money saved or the offer of future services as a freedman or woman, and their sons could be eligible for citizenship; this degree of social mobility was unusual in the ancient world. Freed slaves and the master who freed them retained certain legal and moral mutual obligations. This was the bottom rung of one of Rome's fundamental social and economic institutions, the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client-patron relationship]]. At the top rung were the senatorial families of the landowning nobility, both patrician and plebeian, bound by shifting allegiances and mutual competition. A plebiscite of 218 forbade senators and their sons to engage in substantial trade or money-lending.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 288–291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flower, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', pp. 173–175; Flower is describing the restrictions placed on Senatorial business activity by the ''plebiscitum Claudianum'' of 218 BC, and related legislation: it may have been intended to reduce opportunity for bribery and corruption, or to help Senators focus exclusively on their tasks in government.&lt;/ref&gt; A wealthy equestrian class emerged, not subject to the same trading constraints as senators.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arms, J. B., "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4238697 Senators' Involvement in Commerce in the Late Republic: Some Ciceronian Evidence]", Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 36, ''The Seaborne Commerce of Ancient Rome: Studies in Archaeology and History'' (1980), pp. 77–89, University of Michigan Press for the American Academy in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizen men and [[Women in ancient Rome|citizen women]] were expected to marry, produce as many children as possible, and improve – or at worst, conserve – their family's wealth, fortune, and public profile. [[Marriage in ancient Rome|Marriage]] offered opportunities for political alliance and social advancement. Patricians usually married in a form known as ''[[confarreatio]]'', which transferred the bride from her father's absolute control or "hand" (''manus'') to that of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrician status could only be inherited through birth; an early [[Twelve Tables|law]], introduced by the reactionary [[Decemviri]] but rescinded in 445, sought to prevent marriages between patricians and plebeians; any resulting offspring may not have been legally recognised.&lt;ref&gt;The plebeian involved in such a marriage would likely have been wealthy: see Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Among ordinary plebeians, different marriage forms offered married women considerable more freedom than their patrician counterparts, until ''manus'' marriage was replaced by ''free marriage'', in which the wife remained under the legal authority of her absent father, not her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 20, 53, 54. Plebeian marriage forms include ''coemptio'' (marriage "by purchase" – a form of dowry), and ''usus'' (marriage recognised through the couple's "habitual cohabitation")&lt;/ref&gt; Infant mortality was high. Towards the end of the Republic, the birthrate began to fall among the elite. Some wealthy, childless citizens resorted to [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]] to provide male heirs for their estates, and to forge political alliances. Adoption was subject to the senate's approval; the notoriously unconventional patrician politician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] had himself and his family adopted into a plebeian clan, so that he could hold a plebeian tribunate.

==Trade and economy==
===Farming===
{{Main|Roman agriculture|Ancient Rome and wine}}
The Republic was created during a time of warfare, economic recession, food shortages, and plebeian debt. In wartime, plebeian farmers were liable to conscription. In peacetime, most depended on whatever cereal crops they could produce on small farming plots, allotted to them by the state, or by patrons. Soil fertility varied from place to place, and natural water sources were unevenly distributed throughout the landscape. In good years, a pleb small-holder might trade a small surplus, to meet his family's needs, or to buy the armatures required for his military service. In other years, crop failure through soil exhaustion, adverse weather, disease or military incursions could lead to poverty, unsupported borrowing, and debt. Nobles invested much of their wealth in ever-larger, more efficient farming units, exploiting a range of soil conditions through mixed farming techniques. As farming was labour-intensive, and military conscription reduced the pool of available manpower, over time the wealthy became ever more reliant upon the increasingly plentiful slave-labour provided by successful military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 265–268, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bannon, pp. 5"&gt;Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118–122, 135, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Large, well managed agricultural estates helped provide for clients and dependents, support an urban family home, and fund the owner's public and military career, in the form of cash for bribes and security for loans. Later Roman moralists idealised farming as an intrinsically noble occupation: [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus#First dictatorship|Cincinnatus]] left off his ploughing reluctantly, to serve as [[Roman dictator|dictator]], and returned once his state duties were done.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, iii. 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 412–413: [[Cato the Elder]] dwelt upon the probably mythical poverty of leading Romans such as [[Manius Curius Dentatus|Manius Dentatus]], and the incorruptible [[Gaius Fabricius Luscinus]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein, Nathan, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20430663 Aristocrats and Agriculture in the Middle and Late Republic]", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 98 (2008), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, land taken by conquest was ''[[ager publicus]]'' (public land). In practise, much of it was exploited by the nobility, using slaves rather than free labour. Rome's expansionist wars and colonisations were at least partly driven by the land-hunger of displaced peasants, who must otherwise join the swelling, dependent population of urban ''plebs''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 265–268.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the second Punic War, Rome added the fertile ''[[ager Campanus]]'', suitable for intense cultivation of vines, olives and cereals. Like the grain-fields of Sicily – seized after the same conflict – it was likely farmed extra-legally by leading landowners, using slave-gangs. A portion of Sicily's grain harvest was sent to Rome as [[tribute]], for redistribution by the ''aediles''.&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lintott, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, p. 55: A later consular investigation into similar land-encroachments is dated to 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The urban ''plebs'' increasingly relied on firstly subsidised, then free grain.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', pp. 328–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esquilino - acquedotto Anio Vetus 1000968.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Aqua Anio Vetus]], a [[Roman aqueduct]] built in 272 BC]]
With the introduction of aqueducts (from 312), suburban market-farms could be supplied with run-off or waste aqueduct water. Perishable commodities such as flowers (for perfumes, and festival garlands), fresh grapes, vegetables and orchard fruits, and small livestock such as pigs and chickens, could be farmed close to municipal and urban markets.&lt;ref name="Bannon, pp. 5"/&gt; In the early 2nd century [[Cato the Elder]] tried to block the illicit tapping of rural aqueducts by the elite, who thus exploited the increased productivity of cheaply bought, formerly "dry" farmland; a law was duly passed, but fines for abuses, and taxes on profits, proved more realistic solutions than an outright ban. Food surpluses, no matter how obtained, kept prices low.&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors'', pp. 5–10; citing Hodge, ''Roman Aqueducts'', p. 219 for Cato's diatribe against the misuse of aqueduct water by [[Lucius Furius Purpureo|L. Furius Purpureus]], consul in 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, p. 619.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with increasing competition from provincial and allied grain suppliers, many Roman farmers turned to more profitable crops, especially grapes for wine production. By the late Republican era, Roman wine had been transformed from an indifferent local product for local consumption, to a major domestic and export commodity, with some renowned, costly and collectable vintages.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein, Nathan, "Aristocrats and Agriculture in the Middle Republic", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 98 (2008), pp. 2–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolet, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, pp. 612–615: up to this time, the Roman elite had favoured Greek imported wine over any of Rome's homegrown versions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman writers have little to say about large-scale stock-breeding, but make passing references to its profitability. Drummond speculates that this focus on agriculture rather than livestock might reflect elite preoccupations with historical grain famines, or long-standing competition between agriculturalists and pastoralists. While agriculture was a seasonal practise, pasturage was a year-round requirement. Some of Republican Rome's early agricultural legislation sought to balance the competing public grazing rights of small farmers, the farming elite, and [[Transhumance|transhumant]] pastoralists, who maintained an ancient right to herd, graze and water their animals between low-lying winter pastures and upland summer pastures. From the early second century, transhumance was practised on a vast scale, as an investment opportunity.&lt;ref name="Drummond, pp. 118"&gt;Drummond, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, pp. 118–122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabba, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 8, pp. 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt; Though meat and hides were valuable by products of stock-raising, cattle were primarily reared to pull carts and ploughs, and sheep were bred for their wool, the mainstay of the Roman clothing industry. Horses, mules and donkeys were bred as civil and military transport. Pigs bred prolifically, and could be raised at little cost by any small farmer with rights to [[pannage]]. Their central dietary role is reflected by their use as sacrificial victims in domestic cults, funerals, and cults to agricultural deities.&lt;ref name="Drummond, pp. 118"/&gt;

The myths surrounding king [[Servius Tullius]] include his divine fathering by a [[Lares|Lar]] of the royal household, or by [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], god of fire; and his love-affair with the goddess [[Fortuna]].&lt;/ref&gt; An Imperial-era source claims that the Republic's first consul, Brutus, effectively abolished human sacrifice to the goddess [[Mother of the Lares|Mania]], instituted by the last king, Tarquinius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius|Macrobius]] describes the woolen figurines (''maniae'') hung at crossroad shrines during the popular [[Compitalia]] festival as substitutions for ancient [[human sacrifice]] once held at the same festival and suppressed by Rome's first consul, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|L. Junius Brutus]]. Whatever the truth regarding this sacrifice and its abolition, the Junii celebrated their ancestor cult during Larentalia rather than the usual [[Parentalia]] even in the 1st century BC; see Taylor, Lilly Ross, "The Mother of the Lares", in ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 29, 3, (July–Sept. 1925), pp. 302 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans acknowledged the existence of [[List of Roman deities|innumerable deities]] who controlled the natural world and human affairs. Every individual, occupation and location had a protective [[Tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|tutelary deity]], or sometimes several. Each was associated with a particular, highly prescriptive form of prayer and sacrifice. Piety (''pietas'') was the correct, dutiful and timely performance of such actions. The well-being of each Roman household was thought to depend on daily cult to its [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] (guardian deities, or spirits), ancestors, and the [[Genius (mythology)|divine generative essence]] embodied within its ''pater familias''. A family which neglected its religious responsibilities could not expect to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, D. G., Roman domestic religion: the evidence of the household shrines, ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'', II, 16, 2, Berlin, 1978, 1557–1591.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-being of the Roman state depended on its state deities, whose opinions and will could be discerned by priests and magistrates, trained in augury, [[Haruspex|haruspicy]], oracles and the interpretation of [[Omen (ancient Rome)|omens]]. Impieties in state religion could produce expressions of divine wrath such as social unrest, wars, famines and epidemics, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitiate]] the political process, render elections null and void, and lead to the abandonment of planned treaties, wars and any government business. Accidental errors could be remedied by repeating the rite correctly, or by an additional sacrifice; outright sacrilege threatened the bonds between the human and divine, and carried the death penalty. As divine retribution was invoked in the lawful swearing of oaths and vows, oath-breakers forfeited their right to divine protection, and might be killed with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 241, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman religious authorities were unconcerned with personal beliefs or privately funded cults, unless they offended natural or divine laws, or undermined the ''mos maiorum'' (roughly, "the way of the ancestors"); the relationship between gods and mortals should be sober, contractual, and of mutual benefit. Undignified grovelling, excessive enthusiasm (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]'') and secretive practises were "weak minded" and morally suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Magical practises were officially banned, as attempts to subvert the will of the gods for personal gain, but were probably common among all classes. Private cult organisations that seemed to threaten Rome's political and priestly hierarchy were investigated by the Senate, with advice from the priestly colleges. The Republic's most notable religious suppression was that of the [[Bacchanalia]], a widespread, unofficial, enthusiastic cult to the Greek wine-god [[Bacchus]]. The cult organisation was ferociously [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppressed]], and its deity was absorbed within the official cult to Rome's own wine-god, [[Liber]].&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, Erich S., "The Bacchanalia affair", in ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, pp. 34 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The official recognition, adoption and supervision of foreign deities and practices, whether [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]], [[Sabines|Sabine]], [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] or [[Magna Graecia|colonial Greek]], had been an important unitary feature in Rome's territorial expansion and dominance since the days of the kings. For example, king [[Servius Tullius]] had established an Aventine temple to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as a Roman focus for the [[Latin League]].&lt;ref name="Rüpke, p. 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beard, North pp. 30-35"/&gt;

The gods were thought to communicate their wrath (''[[ira deorum]]'') through [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigies (unnatural or aberrant phenomena)]]. During the crisis of the [[Second Punic War]] an unprecedented number of reported prodigies were expiated, in more than twenty days of public ritual and sacrifices. In the same period, Rome recruited the [[Cybele|"Trojan" Magna Mater (Great Mother of the Gods)]] to the Roman cause, "Hellenised" the native Roman cult to [[Ceres (mythology)#Ceres and Proserpina|Ceres]]; and took control of the [[Bacchanalia]] festival in Rome and its allied territories. Following Rome's disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the State's most prominent [[Sibylline Books|written oracle]] recommended the living burial of [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|human victims]] in the [[Forum Boarium]] to placate the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 295–298; the discovery of a [[Intersex|hermaphroditic]] four-year-old child was expiated by the state [[haruspex]], who set the child to drown in the sea. Its survival for four years after its birth would have been regarded as extreme dereliction of religious duty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxvii. 37, cited by Halm, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 244; see also Rosenberger, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livy]] describes this "bloodless" human sacrifice as an abhorrent but pious necessity; Rome's eventual victory confirmed the gods' approval.&lt;ref&gt;For Livy's use of prodigies and portents as markers of Roman impiety and military failure, see Feeney, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 138, 139. For prodigies in the context of political decision-making, see Rosenberger, pp. 295–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-Republican era, some leading Romans publicly displayed special, sometimes even intimate relationships with particular deities. For instance, [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed Jupiter as a personal mentor. Some gentes claimed a divine descent, often thanks to a [[false etymology]] of their name; the Caecilii Metelli pretended to descend from Vulcan through his son [[Caeculus]], the [[Mamilii]] from [[Circe]] through her granddaughter Mamilia, the [[Julii Caesares]] and the [[Aemilii]] from Venus through her grandsons [[Iulus]] and Aemylos. In the 1st century, [[Sulla]], [[Pompey]], and Caesar made competing claims for Venus' favour.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, "Caeculus", "Aemilia" and others.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Wiseman, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/642729 Legendary Genealogies in Late-Republican Rome]", ''[[Greece &amp; Rome]]'', Second Series, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Oct. 1974), pp. 153–164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priesthoods===
With the abolition of monarchy, some of its sacral duties were shared by the consuls, while others passed to a Republican ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' (king of the sacred rites"), a patrician "king", elected for life, with great prestige but no executive or kingly powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had no specifically priestly class or caste. As every family's ''pater familias'' was responsible for his family's cult activities, he was effectively the senior priest of his own household. Likewise, most priests of public cult were expected to marry, produce children, and support their families.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Vestal Virgins]] were the major exception. The [[Galli]], mendicant eunuch priets of the [[Magna Mater]], were forbidden Roman citizenship.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Republic the patricians, as "fathers" to the Roman people, claimed the right of seniority to lead and control the state's relationship with the divine. Patrician families, in particular the ''Cornelii'', ''Postumii'' and ''Valerii'', monopolised the leading state priesthoods: the ''[[flamines]]'' of [[Flamen Dialis|Jupiter]], [[Flamen Martialis|Mars]] and [[Flamen Quirinalis|Quirinus]], as well as the ''[[pontifices]]''. The patrician ''[[Flamen Dialis]]'' employed the "greater auspices" (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia maiora|auspicia maiora]]'') to consult with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] on significant matters of State.

Twelve "lesser flaminates" (''Flamines minores''), were open to plebeians, or reserved to them. They included a ''Flamen Cerealis'' in service of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], goddess of grain and growth, and protector of plebeian laws and tribunes.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The beginnings of Rome'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The plebs had their own forms of augury, which they credited to [[Marsyas]], a [[satyr]] or [[Silenus|silen]] in the entourage of Liber, plebeian god of grapes, wine, freedom and male fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres and the Death of Tiberius Gracchus", ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1990), pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; The priesthoods of local urban and rustic [[Compitalia]] street-festivals, dedicated to the [[Lares]] of local communities, were open to freedmen and slaves, to whom "even the heavy-handed Cato recommended liberality during the festival"; so that the slaves, "being softened by this instance of humanity, which has something great and solemn about it, may make themselves more agreeable to their masters and be less sensible of the severity of their condition".&lt;ref&gt;Lott, John. B., ''The Neighborhoods of Augustan Rome,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-82827-9}}, pp. 31, 35, citing Cato, ''On agriculture'', 5.3., and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 4.14.2–4 (excerpt), Trans. Cary, Loeb, Cambridge, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the obverse is [[Apollo]], as written on the monogram behind his head, who also wears the attributes of [[Vejovis]], an obscure deity.

The ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'' (300) gave patricians and plebeians more-or-less equal representation in the augural and pontifical colleges;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; other important priesthoods, such as the [[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Quindecimviri]] ("The Fifteen"), and the ''epulones''&lt;ref&gt;Established in 196 to take over the running of a growing number of [[ludi]] and festivals from the ''pontifices''&lt;/ref&gt; were opened to any member of the senatorial class.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lipka, M., ''Roman Gods: a conceptual approach'', Versnel, H., S., Frankfurter, D., Hahn, J., (Editors), ''Religions in the Graeco-Roman world'', Brill, 2009, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; To restrain the accumulation and potential abuse of priestly powers, each ''gens'' was permitted one priesthood at any given time, and the religious activities of senators were monitored by the [[Roman censor|censors]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Magistrates who held an augurate could claim divine authority for their position and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Auctoritas'' (authority) is etymologically linked to ''augur'': See Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Republic, augury came under the control of the ''pontifices'', whose powers were increasingly woven into the civil and military ''[[cursus honorum]]''. Eventually, the office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' became a ''de facto'' consular prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, A. ''The imperial cult and the development of church order: Concepts and images of authority in paganism and early Christianity before the Age of Cyprian'', Brill, 1999, pp. 19–20, 21–25: citing Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cults may have been exclusively female; for example, the rites of the Good Goddess (''[[Bona Dea]]''). Towards the end of the second Punic War, Rome rewarded priestesses of [[Demeter]] from ''Graeca Magna'' with Roman citizenship for training respectable, leading matrons as''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' of "Greek rites" to Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, Barbette Stanley, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 4, 6–13. {{ISBN|0-292-77693-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every matron of a family (the wife of its [[paterfamilias|''pater familias'']]) had a religious duty to maintain the household fire, which was considered an extension of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta's]] sacred fire, tended in perpetuity by the chaste [[Vestal Virgins]]. The Vestals also made the sacrificial ''[[mola salsa]]'' employed in many State rituals, and represent an essential link between domestic and state religion. Rome's survival was thought to depend on their sacred status and ritual purity. Vestals found guilty of inchastity were "willingly" buried alive, to expiate their offence and avoid the imposition of blood-guilt on those who inflicted the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Cunham, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Mary, "The Sexual Status of Vestal Virgins," ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 70, (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;12–27; and Parker, Holt N. "Why Were the Vestals Virgins? Or the Chastity of Women and the Safety of the Roman State", ''American Journal of Philology'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;125, No.&amp;nbsp;4. (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;563–601.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples and festivals===
{{further|Roman temple|Roman festival|Roman calendar|Fasti}}
[[File:Temple of echo Baiae.JPG|thumb|Inside the "Temple of Mercury" at [[Baiae]], a [[swimming pool]] for a [[Roman bath]], built during the late Roman Republic,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Temple-of-Mercury Baiae, historic site, Italy]". ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''. Accessed 6 June 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; and containing one of the [[List of Roman domes|largest domes]] in the world before the building of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]]]

Rome's major public temples were contained within the city's sacred, augural boundary (''[[pomerium]]''), which had supposedly been marked out by Romulus, with Jupiter's approval. The [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] ("Jupiter, Best and Greatest") stood on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. Among the settled areas outside the ''pomerium'' was the nearby [[Aventine Hill]]. It was traditionally associated with Romulus' unfortunate twin, [[Remus]], and in later history with the Latins, and the Roman ''plebs''. The Aventine seems to have functioned as a place for the introduction of "foreign" deities.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Beginnings of Rome'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In 392, [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] established a temple there to [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Regina]], Etruscan [[Veii]]'s protective goddess. Later introductions include [[Summanus]], c. 278, [[Vortumnus]] c. 264, and at some time before the end of the 3rd century, [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, Eric M., Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule, ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), pp. 4–5. For Camillus and Juno, see Stephen Benko, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' Brill, 2004, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; While Ceres' Aventine temple was most likely built at patrician expense, to mollify the ''plebs'', the patricians brought the [[Magna Mater]] ("Great mother of the Gods") to Rome as their own "Trojan" ancestral goddess, and installed her on the Palatine, along with her distinctively "un-Roman" [[Galli]] priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Roller, Lynn Emrich (1999). ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, pp. 282–285. {{ISBN|0-520-21024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romulus was said to have pitched his augural tent atop the Palatine. Beneath its southern slopes ran the [[Via Sacra|sacred way]], next to the former palace of the kings ([[Regia]]), the [[House of the Vestals]] and [[Temple of Vesta]]. Close by were the [[Lupercal]] shrine and the cave where Romulus and Remus were said to have been suckled by the she-wolf. On the flat area between the Aventine and Palatine was the [[Circus Maximus]], which hosted chariot races and religious games. Its several shrines and temples included those to Rome's indigenous sun god, [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]], the moon-goddess [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the grain-storage god, [[Consus]], and the obscure goddess [[Murcia]]. A temple to [[Hercules]] stood in the [[Forum Boarium]], near the Circus starting gate. Every district (''[[Vicus]]'') of the city had a crossroads shrine to its own protective Lares.

Whereas Republican (and thereafter, Imperial) Romans marked the passage of years with the names of their ruling consuls, their [[Roman calendar|calendars]] marked the anniversaries of religious foundations to particular deities, the days when official business was permitted (''fas''), and those when it was not (''nefas''). The Romans observed an eight-day week; markets were held on the ninth day. Each month was presided over by a particular, usually major deity. The oldest calendars were lunar, structured around the most significant periods in the agricultural cycle, and the religious duties required to yield a good harvest.

===In the military===
[[File:Gaius Julius Caesar, denarius, 44 BC, RRC 480-3.jpg|thumb|Denarius of Caesar, minted just before his murder, in 44 BC. It was the first Roman coin bearing the portrait of a living person. The ''[[lituus]]'' and ''culullus'' depicted behind his head refer to his augurate and pontificate. The reverse with Venus alludes to his claimed descent from the goddess.{{Sfnp|Crawford|1974|pp=487–495}}]]
Before any campaign or battle, Roman commanders took [[auspices]], or [[Haruspex|haruspices]], to seek the gods' opinion regarding the likely outcome. Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective ''virtus'' (roughly, "manly virtue") and divine will. [[Roman triumph|Triumphal generals]] dressed as Jupiter Capitolinus, and laid their victor's laurels at his feet. Religious negligence, or lack of ''virtus'', provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, ''Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, North, Price, ''Religions of Rome'', Vol. I, pp. 44, 59, 60, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Military oaths dedicated the oath-takers life to Rome's gods and people; defeated soldiers were expected to take their own lives, rather than survive as captives. Examples of ''[[devotio]]'', as performed by the [[Decia gens|Decii]] Mures, in which soldiers offered and gave their lives to the ''[[Di inferi]]'' (gods of the underworld) in exchange for Roman victory were celebrated as the highest good.

Some of Republican Rome's leading deities were acquired through military actions. In the earliest years of the Republic, [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] promised Veii's goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion ''([[evocatio]])''. He conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome "with miraculous ease" and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 7, part 2, p. 299, citing Livy xxi. 8–9 and xxii. 3–6. Livy describes this as ''[[wiktionary:evocatio|evocatio]]'' (a "calling forth") initiated by Roman soldiers who snatched the goddess's sacrificial portion during her Veiian rites; the Veiian priest had announced that whoever possessed the sacred entrails would win the coming battle.&lt;/ref&gt; The first known temple to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was built to fulfil a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vow]] made by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Q. Fabius Gurges]] during battle against the [[Samnite Wars#Third Samnite War (298 to 290 BC)|Samnites]].&lt;ref&gt;Eden, P. T., "Venus and the Cabbage" Hermes, 91, (1963) p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, R. ''La Religion romaine de Venus'', BEFAR, Paris, 1954, p. 87, suggests that Venus began as an abstraction of personal qualities, later assuming Aphrodite's attributes.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Rome's disastrous defeat by Carthage in the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] (217), Rome laid siege to [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], a Sicillian ally of Carthage. The city's patron deity, whom the Romans recognised as a warlike version of Venus, was [[Evocatio|"persuaded" to change her allegiance]] and was rewarded with a magnificent temple on the [[Capitoline Hill]], as one of Rome's twelve [[Dii consentes]]. ''Venus Victrix'' was thought to grant her favourites a relatively easy victory, worthy of an [[ovation]] and myrtle crown.&lt;ref&gt;See Mary Beard, ''The Roman Triumph'', The Belknap Press, 2007, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, Henrik H. J., ''Bona Dea, The Sources and a Description of the Cult,'' Études préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire romain, 110, Brill, 1989: citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', Book 23, 152–158, and Book 15, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities, towns and villas==
===City of Rome===
[[File:Servian Wall.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|The ruins of the [[Servian Wall]], built during the 4th century BC, one of the earliest [[ancient Roman defensive walls]]]]

Life in the Roman Republic revolved around the city of Rome, and its [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The most important governing, administrative and religious institutions were concentrated at its heart, on and around the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. The city rapidly outgrew its original sacred boundary (''[[pomerium]]''), and its [[Servian Wall|first city walls]]. Further growth was constrained by an inadequate fresh-water supply. Rome's first [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (312) built during the Punic wars crisis, provided a plentiful, clean supply. The building of further aqueducts led to the city's expansion and the establishment of public baths (''[[thermae]]'') as a central feature of Roman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gargarin, M. and Fantham, E. (editors). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1''. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the earliest likely development of Roman public bathing, see Fagan, Garrett T., ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The city also had several [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Mark Wilson ''Principles of Roman Architecture.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], and many taverns and brothels. Living space was at a premium. Some ordinary citizens and freedmen of middling income might live in modest houses but most of the population lived in apartment blocks ([[Insula (building)|''insulae,'' literally "islands"]]), where the better-off might rent an entire ground floor, and the poorest a single, possibly windowless room at the top, with few or no amenities. Nobles and rich patrons lived in spacious, well-appointed town houses; they were expected to keep "open house" for their peers and clients. A semi-public ''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]'' typically functioned as a meeting-space, and a vehicle for display of wealth, artistic taste, and religious piety. Noble ''atria'' were also display areas for ancestor-masks (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual:" Lott, John. B., ''The Neighborhoods of Augustan Rome,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 1, citing Frank E. Brown, ''Roman Architecture'', (New York, 1961, p. 9. Some Roman ritual includes activities which might be called, in modern terms, religious; some is what might be understood in modern terms as secular – the proper and habitual way of doing things. For Romans, both activities were matters of lawful custom (''[[mos maiorum]]'') rather than religious as opposed to secular.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Roman towns and cities had a [[Roman Forum|forum]] and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. [[Aqueduct (Roman)|Aqueducts]] brought water to urban centres.&lt;ref name="Kevin Greene,"&gt;[[Kevin Greene (archaeologist)|Kevin Greene]], "Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I. Finley Re-Considered", ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 53, No. 1. (February 2000), pp. 29–59 (39)&lt;/ref&gt; Landlords generally resided in cities and left their estates in the care of farm managers.

The basic Roman garment was the Greek-style [[tunic]], worn knee-length and short-sleeved (or sleeveless) for men and boys, and ankle-length and long-sleeved for women and girls. The [[toga]] was distinctively Roman. It was thought to have begun during the early [[Roman kingdom]], as a plain woolen "shepherd's wrap", worn by both sexes, all classes, and all occupations, including the military.&lt;ref&gt;According to Roman tradition, soldiers had once worn togas to war, hitching them up with what was known as a "Gabine cinch". See Stone, ''The World of Roman Costume'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle to late Republic, citizen women had abandoned it for the less bulky, Greek-style [[stola]], and the military used it only for off-duty ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;An [[equestrian statue]], described during the Imperial era by Pliny the Elder as "ancient", showed the early, legendary Republican heroine [[Cloelia]] on horseback, wearing a toga: see Olson, ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', p. 151 (note 18).&lt;/ref&gt; The toga became a mark of male citizenship, a statement of social degree.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, Caroline, "[[doi:10.1093/gr/43.2.204|The Myth of the Toga: Understanding the History of Roman Dress]]", ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 43, No. 2 (Oct. 1996), p. 215: Vout cites Servius, ''In Aenidem'', 1.281 and Nonius, 14.867L for the former wearing of togas by women other than prostitutes and adulteresses.&lt;/ref&gt; Convention also dictated the type, colour and style of ''[[Calceus|calcei]]'' (ankle-boots) appropriate to each level of male citizenship; red for senators, brown with crescent-shaped buckles for [[equites]], and plain tanned for ''plebs''.

The whitest, most voluminous togas were worn by the senatorial class. High ranking magistrates, priests and citizen's children were entitled to a purple-bordered ''[[toga praetexta]]''. [[Roman triumph|Triumphal generals]] wore an all-purple, gold-embroidered [[toga picta]], associated with the image of [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter]] and Rome's former [[King of Rome|kings]] – but only for a single day; Republican mores simultaneously fostered competitive display and [[Sumptuary law|attempted its containment]], to preserve at least a notional equality between peers, and reduce the potential threats of class envy.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Harriet F., ''Ancestor Masks and Aristocratic Power in Roman Culture'', Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 118: "The best model for understanding Roman sumptuary legislation is that of aristocratic self-preservation within a highly competitive society which valued overt display of prestige above all else."&lt;/ref&gt; Togas, however, were impractical for physical activities other than sitting in the theatre, public oratory, and attending the ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|salutiones]]'' ("greeting sessions") of rich patrons. Most Roman citizens, particularly the lower class of plebs, seem to have opted for more comfortable and practical garments, such as tunics and cloaks.

Luxurious and highly coloured clothing had always been available to those who could afford it, particularly women of the leisured classes. There is material evidence for cloth-of-gold ([[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]]) as early as the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, ''The World of Roman Costume'', pp. 62–68.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century, significant quantities of raw [[silk]] was being imported [[Han dynasty|from China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionaries of Civilization: Rome| author=Gabucci, Ada| publisher=University of California Press| year=2005| page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Lex Oppia]]'' (215), which restricted personal expenditure on such luxuries as purple clothing, was repealed in 195, after a mass public protest by wealthy Roman matrons.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, Rawson, Morel, ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. 9, pp. 181–185, 439, 453, 495.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tyrian purple]], as a quasi-sacred colour, was officially reserved for the border of the ''toga praetexta'' and for the solid purple ''toga picta'';&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Mark, ''Colour and Meaning in Ancient Rome'', Cambridge Classical Studies, Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp. 189, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', pp. 28–30; Keith, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; but towards the end of the Republic, the notorious [[Verres]] was wearing a purple ''[[pallium]]'' at all-night parties, not long before his trial, disgrace and exile for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, ''The World of Roman Costume'', pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

For most Romans, even the simplest, cheapest linen or woolen clothing represented a major expense. Worn clothing was passed down the social scale until it fell to rags, and these in turn were used for patchwork.&lt;ref&gt;Vout, Caroline, "The Myth of the Toga: Understanding the History of Roman Dress", ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 43, No. 2 (Oct. 1996), pp. 211, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Wool and linen were the mainstays of Roman clothing, idealised by Roman moralists as simple and frugal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Edmondson, ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Landowners were advised that female slaves not otherwise occupied should be producing homespun woolen cloth, good enough for clothing the better class of slave or supervisor. [[Cato the Elder]] recommended that slaves be given a new cloak and tunic every two years; coarse rustic homespun would likely be "too good" for the lowest class of slave, but not good enough for their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, ''The World of Roman Costume'', p. 70, citing Columella, 12, praef. 9–10, 12.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt; For most women, the carding, combing, spinning and weaving of wool were part of daily housekeeping, either for family use or for sale. In traditionalist, wealthy households, the family's wool-baskets, spindles and looms were positioned in the semi-public reception area (''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]''), where the [[mater familias]] and her [[Pater familias#The Roman familia|familia]] could thus demonstrate their industry and frugality; a largely symbolic and moral activity for those of their class, rather than practical necessity.&lt;ref&gt;In reality, she was the female equivalent of the romanticised citizen-farmer: see Flower, ''Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'', pp. 153, 195–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Republic wore on, its trade, territories and wealth increased. Roman conservatives deplored the apparent erosion of traditional, class-based dress distinctions, and an increasing Roman appetite for luxurious fabrics and exotic "foreign" styles among all classes, including their own. Towards the end of the Republic, the ultra-traditionalist [[Cato the Younger]] publicly protested the self-indulgent greed and ambition of his peers, and the loss of Republican [[Virtus|"manly virtues"]], by wearing a "skimpy" dark woolen toga, without tunic or footwear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]]'s history of Rome finds its strife-torn Late Republic tottering at the edge of chaos; most seem to dress as they like, not as they ought: "For now the Roman people are much mixed with foreigners, there is equal citizenship for freedmen, and slaves dress like their masters. With the exception of the Senators, free citizens and slaves wear the same costume." See Rothfus, MA, "The Gens Togata: Changing Styles and Changing Identities", ''American Journal of Philology'', 2010, p. 1, citing Appian, 2.17.120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and dining===
{{main|Ancient Roman cuisine}}
[[File:Scène de banquet, fresque, Herculanum.jpg|thumb|Banquet scene, [[fresco]], [[Herculaneum]], Italy, c. 50 BC]]
Modern study of the dietary habits during the Republic are hampered by various factors. Few writings have survived, and because different components of their diet are more or less likely to be preserved, the archaeological record cannot be relied on.&lt;ref&gt;Witcher, R.E. (2016) ''Agricultural production in Roman Italy'' [http://dro.dur.ac.uk/20474/1/20474.pdf (see page 8)] from ''A companion to Roman Italy''. (Wiley-Blackwell). Blackwell companions to the ancient world. pp. 459–482.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Elder]]'s ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' includes several recipes and his suggested "Rations for the hands". The list of ingredients includes cheese, honey, poppy seeds, coriander, fennel, cumin, egg, olives, bay leaves, laurel twig, and anise. He gives instructions for kneading bread, making porridge, [[Placenta cake]], brine, various wines, preserving lentils, planting asparagus, curing ham, and fattening geese and squab.&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''De Agri Cultura'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html ch. 74–90], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/G*.html 104–125], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/K*.html 156–157], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/L*.html 158–162].&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Horace]] mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "As for me, olives, [[endive]]s, and smooth [[Althaea (plant)|mallows]] provide sustenance."&lt;ref&gt;"Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea levesque malvae." Horace, ''Odes 1.31.15'', c. 30 BC&lt;/ref&gt; Meat, fish and produce were a part of the Roman diet at all levels of society.&lt;ref&gt;Kron, Geoffrey (2012), Scheidel, W. (ed.), ''Food Production'' [http://web.stanford.edu/~scheidel/CCRE%20Chapter%208%20Supplement.pdf (see p. 8, fn 72)] from ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Economy'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 156–174&lt;/ref&gt;

Romans valued fresh fruit, and had a diverse variety available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kron, Food Production [http://web.stanford.edu/~scheidel/CCRE%20Chapter%208%20Supplement.pdf (see p. 16)]&lt;/ref&gt; Wine was considered the basic drink,&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 46-56"&gt;Phillips pp. 46–56&lt;/ref&gt; consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce.&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 35-45"&gt;Phillips pp. 35–45&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. Accusations of alcoholism were used to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]],&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 57-63"&gt;Phillipa pp. 57–63&lt;/ref&gt; and Cicero's own son Marcus ([[Cicero Minor]]). Even [[Cato the Younger]] was known to be a heavy drinker.&lt;ref&gt;"Af first, he would drink once after supper and then leave the table; but as time went on he would allow himself to drink very generously, so that he often tarried at his wine till early morning." [[Plutarch]], ''Cato the Younger'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and language===
{{Main|Roman school|Latin}}
Rome's original native language was [[early Latin]], the language of the [[Italic peoples|Italic]] [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]]. Most surviving [[Latin literature]] is written in [[Classical Latin]], a highly stylised and polished [[literary language]] which developed from early and vernacular spoken Latin, from the 1st century. Most Latin speakers used [[Vulgar Latin]], which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Following various military conquests in the [[Greek East]], Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system.&lt;ref name="Legacy"&gt;Nanette R. Pacal, "The Legacy of Roman Education (in the Forum)", in ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 79, No. 4. (April–May 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Strenuous, disciplined physical training helped prepare boys of citizen class for their eventual citizenship and a military career. Girls generally received instruction&lt;ref name="Ox"&gt;Oxford Classical Dictionary, Edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, Third Edition. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; from their mothers in the art of spinning, weaving, and sewing.
Schooling in a more formal sense was begun around 200. Education began at the age of around six, and in the next six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking. Effective [[Rhetoric|oratory]] and good Latin were highly valued among the elite, and were essential to a career in law or politics.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Farrell, ''Latin Language and Latin Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74–75; Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
{{Main|Roman Republican art|Latin literature|Music of ancient Rome}}

In the 3rd century, Greek art taken as the spoils of war became popular, and many Roman homes were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toynbee |first=J.M.C. |date=December 1971 |title=Roman Art |journal=The Classical Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=439–442 |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00221331 |jstor=708631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, [[Roman architecture]] was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. &lt;!--The [[Roman concrete]] has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, ''The Architecture of the Roman Empire'', rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Literature===
{{Main|Classical Latin#Republican|Latin Literature#The Age of Cicero|}}
Early Roman literature was influenced heavily by Greek authors. From the mid-Republic, Roman authors followed Greek models, to produce free-verse and verse-form plays and other in Latin; for example, [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote tragedies and comedies. The earliest Latin works to have survived intact are the comedies of [[Plautus]], written during the mid-Republic. Works of well-known, popular playwrights were sometimes commissioned for performance at religious festivals; many of these were [[satyr play]]s, based on Greek models and Greek myths. The poet [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]] may be said to have written the first Roman epic poem, although [[Ennius]] was the first Roman poet to write an epic in an adapted Latin hexameter. However, only fragments of Ennius' epic, the ''[[Annales (Ennius)|Annales]]'', have survived, yet both Naevius and Ennius influenced later Latin epic, especially [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. [[Lucretius]], in his ''[[De rerum natura|On the Nature of Things]]'', explicated the tenets of [[Epicurean]] philosophy.

The politician, poet and philosopher [[Cicero]]'s literary output was remarkably prolific and so influential on contemporary and later literature that the period from 83 BC to 43 BC has been called the "Age of Cicero". His oratory set new standards for centuries, and continue to influence modern speakers, while his philosophical works, which were, for the most part, Cicero's Latin adaptations of Greek Platonic and Epicurean works influenced many later philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zauzmer |first1=Julie |title=Donald Trump, the Cicero of 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2016/11/03/donald-trump-the-cicero-of-2016/ |website=The Washington Post (WP Company LLC) [US] |access-date=4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Miriam |editor1-last=Boardman |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Griffin |editor2-first=Jasper |editor3-last=Murray |editor3-first=Oswyn |title=The Oxford History of the Classical World |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-285236-1 |pages=454–459 |chapter=Cicero and Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent writers of this period include the grammarian and historian of religion [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the politician, general and military commentator [[Julius Caesar]], the historian [[Sallust]] and the love poet [[Catullus]].

===Sports and entertainment===
[[File:Amphitheatre 1 Pompeii.jpg|thumb|The [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii]], built around 70 BC and buried by [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|the eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] 79 AD, once hosted spectacles with [[gladiator]]s.]]
The city of Rome had a place called the [[Campus Martius]] ("Field of Mars"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In the countryside, pastimes included fishing and hunting. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Board games played in Rome included [[dice]] (Tesserae or [[Venus Throw|Tali]]), Roman Chess ([[Ludus latrunculorum|Latrunculi]]), Roman [[Draughts|Checkers]] (Calculi), [[Tic-tac-toe]] (Terni Lapilli), and [[Ludus duodecim scriptorum]] and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon.&lt;ref name="austin-roman1"&gt;Austin, Roland G. "Roman Board Games. I", ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4:10, October 1934. pp. 24–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities included chariot races, and musical and theatrical performances. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
