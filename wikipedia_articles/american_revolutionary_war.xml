The '''American Revolutionary War''' (April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783), also known as the '''Revolutionary War''' or the '''American War of Independence,''' was initiated by delegates from [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] of [[British America]] in [[Continental Congress|Congress]] against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] over their objection to [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament's]] taxation policies and [[No taxation without representation|lack of colonial representation]].{{Efn|The scope of the American Revolutionary War is dated 1775–1783 between the United Colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain; it was fought over the issue of American independence. Engagements took place in [[North America]], the [[Caribbean Sea]], and in the [[North Atlantic]], specifically the [[North Sea]], the [[Irish Sea]], and the [[English Channel]]. Formally, the "American War" was from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by Congress addressed to Great Britain, to the September 1783 British-American [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] to end the American Revolutionary War. Though signed on 2 September, it did not take effect until the day after "at the pleasure" of King George, at the signing of the Anglo-French [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in the palace of Louis XVI; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] followed the French. The Congress was not a signatory to either of these last two.&lt;ref name="9w1sv"&gt;[[#wallaceray2015|Wallace 2015]], "American Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;}} From their founding in the 1600s, the colonies were largely left to govern themselves. The cost of victory in the 1754 to 1763 [[French and Indian War]] and the 1756 to 1763 [[Seven Years' War]] left the British government deeply in debt; the [[The Thirteen Colonies|colonies]], where the war was fought, equipped and populated the British forces there at the cost of millions of their own funds. The [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] provoked colonial opposition and unrest, leading to the 1770 [[Boston Massacre]] and 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]]. When Parliament imposed the [[Intolerable Acts]] in spring 1774 upon [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], twelve colonies sent delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] (September 5 – October 26, 1774) to draft a [[Petition to the King]] and organize a boycott of British goods.{{Efn|The [[colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later. Of interest, the [[Vermont Republic]] was independently established 1777–1791 before its admission to the US. Their [[Green Mountain Boys]] won an early engagement in May 1775 at [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]], and [[Ethan Allen]] later served as a general in the Continental Army.}}

Fighting broke out on 19 April 1775: the British army stationed at Boston was harassed by the Massachusetts militia at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] after destroying colonial Assembly powder stores. In June, the [[Second Continental Congress]] appointed [[George Washington]] to create a [[Continental Army]] and oversee the [[Siege of Boston|capture of Boston]] (April 19, 1775 – March 17, 1776). The [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] sent the [[Olive Branch Petition]] (signed July 8, 1775) to the King and Parliament, both of whom rejected it. In response, they invaded [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|British Quebec]] but were repulsed. In July 1776, Congress unanimously passed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Hopes of a quick settlement were supported by [[Rockingham Whigs|American sympathizers within Parliament]] who opposed [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s "coercion policy" in the colonies. However, after the British were [[Siege of Boston|driven out]] of Boston the new British commander-in-chief, General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|counter-offensive]] and captured New York City. After [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing the Delaware]] Washington engaged and routed Hessian forces at the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the British at the [[Battle of Princeton]]. After British General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] surrendered at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, Howe's 1777–1778 [[Philadelphia campaign]] captured that city. Washington retreated to [[Valley Forge]] during the winter of 1777–1778 where Prussian allied General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|von Steuben]] drilled the largely untrained [[Continental Army]] into an organized fighting unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=How Valley Forge Transformed the Continental Army Into a Fighting Force|url=https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/valley-forge|access-date=2021-07-07|website=HISTORY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] saw the war as a way to create an America economically and militarily dependent on France, not Britain. Although talks on a formal alliance began in late 1776, they proceeded slowly until the Patriot victory at Saratoga in October 1777. Fears Congress might come to an early settlement with Britain resulted in France and the United States signing two treaties in February 1778. The first was a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (France–United States)|commercial treaty]], the second a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]; in return for a French guarantee of American independence, Congress agreed to join the war against Britain and defend the [[French West Indies]]. Although Spain refused to join the Franco-American alliance, in the 1779 [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] they agreed to support France in its [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|global war with Britain]], hoping to regain losses incurred in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/treaty-of-aranjuez-1779/|access-date=2021-07-07|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other fronts in North America, Governor of Spanish Louisiana [[Bernardo de Gálvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston|Bernardo Gálvez]] routed British forces from [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]. The Spanish, along with [[Privateer#United States|American privateers]] supplied the 1779 American conquest of [[Illinois campaign|Western Quebec]] ([[Northwest Territory#British control|later the US Northwest Territory]]).&lt;ref name="k8Ak6"&gt;[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy 2013]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Gálvez then expelled British forces from Mobile during the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]] and the [[siege of Pensacola]], cutting off British military aid to their American Indian allies in the interior southeast. Howe's replacement, General [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]], then mounted a 1778 "[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War#British campaign in the South|Southern strategy]]" from Charleston. After [[Capture of Savannah|capturing Savannah]], defeats at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Cowpens]] forced [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] to retreat to [[Siege of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], where his army was besieged by an allied French and American force. An attempt to resupply the garrison was repulsed by the French navy at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], and Cornwallis surrendered in October 1781.

Although their war with France and Spain continued for another two years, the British fight against the Americans ended with the Battle of Yorktown. The [[North Ministry]] was replaced by [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]], who accepted office on the basis [[George III]] agreed to American independence. Preliminary articles were signed in November 1782, and in April 1783 Congress accepted British terms; these included independence, evacuation of British troops, cession of territory up to the [[Mississippi River]] and navigation to the sea, as well as fishing rights in Newfoundland. On September 3, 1783, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed between Great Britain and the United States, then ratified the following spring.

The [[French and Indian War]] and the wider conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]] ended with the [[Peace of Paris (1763)|1763 Peace of Paris]], which expelled France from [[New France|North America]].&lt;ref name="wtW8l"&gt;[[#calloway2007|Calloway 2007]], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the British rescinded provisions of colonial charters claiming to extend from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]]; the [[Mississippi River]] became the dividing line between British and Spanish possessions in the Americas, with free navigation on it "to the open sea". More American territory changed hands in 1763 than any settlement before or after, destabilizing existing alliances and trade networks, and leading to conflict between settlers and American Indians.&lt;ref name="zEtee"&gt;[[#calloway2007|Calloway 2007]], pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Proclamation Line of 1763]] was intended to refocus colonial expansion north into Nova Scotia or south into Florida while separating American Indians and colonials by restricting settlement in the west. Both sides agreed with the principle but disagreed on where to set the border; keeping the peace required garrisons of regular troops along the frontier, and led to disputes with the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|colonial legislatures]] over who should bear the expense.&lt;ref name="pb2Zp"&gt;[[#calloway2007|Calloway 2007]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation and legislation===

A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building|{{Center|The 1774 [[Boston Tea Party]]&lt;br /&gt;in a sympathetic 19th c. print}}]]

Although directly administered by the Crown, acting through a local Governor, the colonies were largely governed by native-born property owners. While external affairs were managed by [[London]], colonial [[Militia (United States)|militia]] were funded locally but with the ending of the French threat in 1763, the legislatures expected less taxation, not more. At the same time, the huge costs of the Seven Years' War meant [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] expected the colonies to fund their own defense.&lt;ref name="pb2Zp" /&gt; The outcome was a series of disputes as to how these expenses should be paid.&lt;ref name="OcHT1"&gt;[[#bellot|Bellot 1960]], pp. 73–77&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1763 to 1765 [[Grenville ministry]] began by instructing the Royal Navy to stop the trade of smuggled goods and enforce customs duties levied in American ports.&lt;ref name="pb2Zp" /&gt; The most important was the 1733 [[Molasses Act]]; routinely ignored prior to 1763, it had a significant economic impact since 85% of New England rum exports were manufactured from imported molasses. These measures were followed by the [[Sugar Act]] and [[Stamp Act]], which imposed additional taxes on the colonies to pay for defending the western frontier.&lt;ref name="4R8zt"&gt;[[#watsonclark|Watson and Clark 1960]], pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1765, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] formed the [[First Rockingham ministry]], which repealed the Stamp Act and reduced tax on foreign molasses to help the New England economy, but re-asserted Parliamentary authority in the [[Declaratory Act]].&lt;ref name="Leqka"&gt;[[#watsonclark|Watson and Clark 1960]], pp. 116, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this did little to end the discontent; in 1768, a riot started in Boston when the authorities seized the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' on suspicion of smuggling.&lt;ref name="sImY5"&gt;[[#morgan2012|Morgan 2012]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions escalated further in March 1770 when British troops fired on rock-throwing civilians, killing five in what became known as the [[Boston massacre|Boston Massacre]].&lt;ref name="kIDxS"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The Massacre coincided with the partial repeal of the [[Townshend Acts]] by the Tory-based [[North Ministry]], which came to power in January 1770 and remained in office until 1781. North insisted on retaining duty on tea to enshrine Parliament's right to tax the colonies; the amount was minor, but ignored the fact it was that very principle Americans objected to.&lt;ref name="HdjZT"&gt;[[#morgan2012|Morgan 2012]], p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions escalated following the destruction of a customs vessel in the June 1772 [[Gaspee Affair]], then came to a head in 1773. A [[Crisis of 1772|banking crisis]] led to the near-collapse of the [[East India Company]], which dominated the British economy; to support it, Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]], giving it a trading monopoly in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Since most American tea was smuggled by the Dutch, the Act was opposed by those who managed the illegal trade, while being seen as yet another attempt to impose the principle of taxation by Parliament.&lt;ref name="oTpsv"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in December 1773, [[Sons of Liberty|The Sons of Liberty]] protested the Tea Act by disguising themselves as Mohawk Indians and dumping 342 crates of tea into the Boston Harbor. This event would be known as the [[Boston Tea Party]]. In response, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts, also called the [[Intolerable Acts]] by the colonists. While aimed specifically at Massachusetts, many in America and within the Whig opposition considered them a threat to liberty in general; it led to increased sympathy for the Patriot cause locally, as well as in Parliament and the London press.&lt;ref name="t3NFX"&gt;[[#ammerman|Ammerman 1974]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break with the British Crown===
Over the course of the 18th century, the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies#Assembly|elected lower houses]] in the colonial legislatures gradually wrested power from their Royal Governors.&lt;ref name="0pRKw"&gt;[[#olsen1992|Olsen 1992]], pp. 543–544&lt;/ref&gt; Dominated by smaller landowners and merchants, these Assemblies now established ad hoc provincial legislatures, variously called Congresses, Conventions, and Conferences, effectively replacing Royal control. With the exception of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]], twelve colonies sent representatives to the [[First Continental Congress]] to agree on a unified response to the crisis.&lt;ref name="0j3B4"&gt;[[#ferling2003|Ferling 2003]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the delegates feared that an all-out boycott would result in war and sent a [[Petition to the King]] calling for the repeal of the Intolerable Acts.&lt;ref name="BkMNP"&gt;[[#ferling2015|Ferling 2015]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; However, after some debate, on September 17, 1774, Congress endorsed the Massachusetts [[Suffolk Resolves]] and on October 20 passed the [[Continental Association]]; based on a draft prepared by the [[First Virginia Convention]] in August, this instituted [[economic sanctions]] against Britain.&lt;ref name="yBXBu"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

While denying its authority over internal American affairs, a faction led by [[James Duane]] and future Loyalist [[Joseph Galloway]] insisted Congress recognize Parliament's right to regulate colonial trade.&lt;ref name="yBXBu" /&gt; {{Efn|"Resolved, 4. That the foundation of English liberty, and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council: … they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several provincial legislatures, where their right of representation can alone be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal polity, subject only to the negative of their sovereign, …: But, … we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British parliament, as are bonafide, restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members; excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, [without the consent of American subjects]." quoted from the Declarations and Resolves of the First Continental Congress October 14, 1774.}} Expecting concessions by the North administration, Congress authorized the extralegal committees and conventions of the colonial legislatures to enforce the boycott; this succeeded in reducing British imports by 97% from 1774 to 1775.&lt;ref name="RVpda"&gt;[[#kramnick82|Paine, Kramnick (Ed.) 1982]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 9 Parliament declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and instituted a blockade of the colony.&lt;ref name="X94UC"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the [[Restraining Acts 1775|Restraining Acts]] limited colonial trade with the [[British West Indies]] and Britain and barred New England ships from the [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador#Fishing|Newfoundland cod fisheries]].

===Political reactions===
{{Main|Olive Branch Petition|United States Declaration of Independence}}
After the Patriot victory at Concord, moderates in Congress led by [[John Dickinson]] drafted the [[Olive Branch Petition]], offering to accept royal authority in return for George III mediating in the dispute.&lt;ref name="PP6G1"&gt;[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy 2013]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it was immediately followed by the [[Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms]], Colonial Secretary [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Dartmouth]] viewed the offer as insincere; he refused to present the petition to the king, which was therefore rejected in early September.&lt;ref name="NXP0A"&gt;[[#brown41|Brown 1941]], pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt; Although constitutionally correct, since George could not oppose his own government, it disappointed those Americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute, while the hostility of his language annoyed even [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|Loyalist]] members of Congress.&lt;ref name="PP6G1" /&gt; Combined with the [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], issued on August 23 in response to the Battle at Bunker Hill, it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement.&lt;ref name="Wm1UE"&gt;[[#ketchum2014a|Ketchum 2014a]], p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Backed by the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], Parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by 170 votes, fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the Americans towards independence.&lt;ref name="3HdY2"&gt;[[#maier1998|Maier 1998]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of 1774 the collapse of British authority meant both North and George III were convinced war was inevitable.&lt;ref name="fFVBS"&gt;[[#ferling2003|Ferling 2003]], pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; After Boston, Gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements; the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] approved the recruitment of new regiments, while allowing Catholics to enlist for the first time.&lt;ref name="sIPUV"&gt;[[#lecky3|Lecky 1892]], vol. 3, pp. 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; Britain also signed a series of treaties with German states to supply [[Hessian (soldier)|additional troops]].&lt;ref name="r0rPV"&gt;[[#davenport1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 132–144&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year it had an army of over 32,000 men in America, the largest ever sent outside Europe at the time.&lt;ref name="w4iIO"&gt;[[#smithD2012|Smith, D. 2012]], pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Livingston (chancellor)|Livingston]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]-principal author, [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]}}]]

However, the use of German mercenaries and Catholics was opposed by many in Parliament and the Protestant-dominated colonial assemblies; combined with the lack of activity by Gage, it allowed the Patriots to take control of the legislatures.&lt;ref name="IX4x8"&gt;[[#miller1959|Miller, J. 1959]], pp. 410–12&lt;/ref&gt; Support for independence was boosted by [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', which was widely reprinted.&lt;ref name="pQBQ5"&gt;[[#maier1998|Maier 1998]], pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; To draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Congress appointed the [[Committee of Five]], consisting of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Robert Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]].&lt;ref name="5Q4nj"&gt;[[#mccullough2005|McCullough 2005]], pp. 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies as "one people", it simultaneously dissolved political links with Britain, while including a long list of alleged violations of "English rights" committed by George III.&lt;ref name="U69zA"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, Congress voted for independence and published the declaration on July 4,&lt;ref name="R0xyC"&gt;[[#maier1998|Maier 1998]], pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt; which Washington read to his troops in New York City on July 9.&lt;ref name="7tFc1"&gt;[[#fischer2004|Fischer, D. 2004]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the Revolution ceased to be an internal dispute over trade and tax policies and became a civil war. The states as represented in Congress were engaged in a struggle with Britain, but each in turn was split between Patriots and Loyalists.&lt;ref name="IE7Bq"&gt;[[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Patriots generally supported independence from Britain and a new national union in Congress, while Loyalists remained faithful to British rule.

At the onset of the war, the [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] realized defeating Britain required foreign alliances and intelligence-gathering. The [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] was formed for "the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world". From 1775 to 1776, it shared information and built alliances through secret correspondence, as well as employing secret agents in Europe to gather intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications and initiate Patriot propaganda campaigns.&lt;ref name="oh504"&gt;[[#amintelrev|CIA 2007]], "Intelligence Until WWII"&lt;/ref&gt; Paine served as secretary, while [[Silas Deane]] was instrumental in securing French aid in Paris.&lt;ref name="tVHhI"&gt;[[#alexrose|Rose A. 2014]]&amp;nbsp;[2006], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==War breaks out==
As the American Revolutionary War unfolded in North America, there were two principal campaign theaters within the thirteen states, and a smaller but strategically important one [[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|west of the Appalachian Mountains]] to the Mississippi River and north to the Great Lakes. The full-on military campaigning began in the [[Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War|states north of Maryland]], and fighting was most frequent and severest there between 1775 and 1778. Patriots achieved several strategic victories [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War#Early operations, 1775–1778|in the South]], the British lost their first army at Saratoga, and the French entered the war as an American ally.&lt;ref name="EiVQB"&gt;[[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga|expanded Northern theater]] and wintering at [[Valley Forge]], General Washington observed British operations coming out of New York at the 1778 [[Battle of Monmouth]]. He then closed off British initiatives by a series of raids that contained the British army in New York City. The same year, Spanish-supplied Virginia Colonel [[George Rogers Clark]] joined by [[French colonization of the Americas|Francophone settlers]] and their Indian allies conquered [[Province of Quebec|Western Quebec]], the US [[Northwest Territory]].

Starting in 1779, the British initiated a [[George Washington in the American Revolution#British southern strategy|southern strategy]] to begin at [[History of Savannah, Georgia#British colony|Savannah]], gather Loyalist support, and reoccupy Patriot-controlled territory north to [[Chesapeake Colonies|Chesapeake Bay]]. Initially the British were successful, and the Americans lost an entire army at the [[siege of Charleston]], which caused a severe setback for Patriots in the region. But then British maneuvering north led to a combined American and French force cornering a second British army at [[Siege of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]], and their surrender effectively ended the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name="DEcPu" /&gt;

===Early engagements===
On April 14, 1775, Sir [[Thomas Gage]], who was [[Commander-in-Chief, North America]] from 1763 to 1775 and appointed Governor of [[Province of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] in 1774, received orders from Britain to take action against the Patriots. Acting on intelligence, Gage planned to destroy stores of militia ordnance at [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] by way of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] and to capture [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]], considered the two principal instigators of the rebellion. The operation was to commence before midnight on April 19 and surprise the militia while completing their objectives and retreating to Boston before multitudes of patriot militias could respond.&lt;ref name="oSWXd"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icqWN"&gt;Fischer, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|Patriot intelligence]], which [[Paul Revere]] had helped organize, learned of Gage's intentions, and Revere alerted Captain [[John Parker (captain)|John Parker]], commander of the Concord militia.&lt;ref name="Q5xrq"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 129–19&lt;/ref&gt; The first action of the war was a [[Shot heard round the world|brief skirmish at Lexington]], followed by a full-scale battle during the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].

On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress officially assumed command of patriot forces in Boston, giving birth to the Continental Army, which now needed a Commander-in-Chief. To lead Patriot forces surrounding Boston, Congressional leader [[John Adams]] of [[Massachusetts in the American Revolution|Massachusetts]] nominated [[Virginia in the American Revolution|Virginia delegate]] [[George Washington in the American Revolution|George Washington]] for commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]] in June 1775.

Howe feared another battle like Bunker Hill, so he evacuated Boston. The British were permitted to withdraw without further casualties on March 17 (known as [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]]), and they sailed to [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

===British New York counter-offensive===
{{Main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
After regrouping at [[History of Halifax (former city)#The American Revolution|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], William Howe was determined to take the fight to the Americans.&lt;ref name="86AtO"&gt;[[#fischer2004|Fischer, D. 2004]], pp. 78–76&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed for New York in June 1776 and began landing troops on [[Staten Island#18th century and the American Revolution|Staten Island]] near the entrance to [[New York Harbor#Colonial era|New York Harbor]] on July 2.

On August 12, 1776, Patriot [[Thomas Knowlton]] was given orders to form an elite group for reconnaissance and secret missions. [[Knowlton's Rangers]], which included [[Nathan Hale]], became the Army's first intelligence unit.&lt;ref name="mgY85"&gt;[[#johnston1897|Johnston 1897]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|To learn when and where the attack would occur Washington asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn.

The 1776 campaign demonstrated regaining New England would be a prolonged affair, which led to a change in British strategy. This involved isolating the north from the rest of the country by taking control of the [[Hudson River]], allowing them to focus on the south where Loyalist support was believed to be substantial.&lt;ref name="RnTHY"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1776, Howe wrote to the Colonial Secretary [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord Germain]], proposing a limited offensive against Philadelphia, while a second force moved down the Hudson from Canada.&lt;ref name="FD6xX"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Germain received this on February 23, 1777, followed a few days later by a memorandum from Burgoyne, then in London on leave.&lt;ref name="qw8y4"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoyne supplied several alternatives, all of which gave him responsibility for the offensive, with Howe remaining on the defensive. The option selected required him to lead the main force south from [[Montreal]] down the Hudson Valley, while a detachment under [[Barry St. Leger]] moved east from Lake Ontario. The two would meet at [[History of Albany, New York (1664–1784)#1744−American Revolution|Albany]], leaving Howe to decide whether to join them.&lt;ref name="qw8y4" /&gt; Reasonable in principle, this did not account for the logistical difficulties involved and Burgoyne erroneously assumed Howe would remain on the defensive; Germain's failure to make this clear meant he opted to attack [[Philadelphia campaign|Philadelphia]] instead.&lt;ref name="UlroQ"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoyne set out on June 14, 1777, with a mixed force of British regulars, German auxiliaries and Canadian militia, and [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|captured Fort Ticonderoga]] on July 5. As General [[Horatio Gates]] retreated, his troops blocked roads, destroyed bridges, dammed streams, and stripped the area of food.&lt;ref name="KjViH"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 244–249&lt;/ref&gt; This slowed Burgoyne's progress and forced him to send out large foraging expeditions; on one of these, more than 700 British troops were captured at the [[Battle of Bennington]] on August 16.&lt;ref name="BNFDD"&gt;[[#gabriel2012|Gabriel 2012]], p. x&lt;/ref&gt; St Leger moved east and besieged [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|Fort Stanwix]]; despite defeating an American relief force at the [[Battle of Oriskany]] on August 6, he was abandoned by his Indian allies and withdrew to Quebec on August 22.&lt;ref name="SzR6M"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Now isolated and outnumbered by Gates, Burgoyne continued onto Albany rather than retreating to Fort Ticonderoga, reaching [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]] on September 13. He constructed defenses around the town and asked Clinton for support while constructing defenses around the town.&lt;ref name="VbMeB"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 337–339&lt;/ref&gt;

Morale among his troops rapidly declined, and an unsuccessful attempt to break past Gates at the [[Battles of Saratoga#First Saratoga|Battle of Freeman Farms]] on September 19 resulted in 600 British casualties.&lt;ref name="xIkVK"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; When Clinton advised he could not reach them, Burgoyne's subordinates advised retreat; a [[reconnaissance in force]] on October 7 was repulsed by Gates at the [[Battles of Saratoga#Second Saratoga|Battle of Bemis Heights]], forcing them back into Saratoga with heavy losses. By October 11, all hope of escape had vanished; persistent rain reduced the camp to a "squalid hell" of mud and starving cattle, supplies were dangerously low and many of the wounded in agony.&lt;ref name="MRVwq"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; Burgoyne capitulated on October 17; around 6,222 soldiers, including German forces commanded by [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel|General Riedesel]], surrendered their arms before being taken to Boston, where they were to be transported to England.&lt;ref name="G36uo"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 421–424&lt;/ref&gt;

After securing additional supplies, Howe made another attempt on Philadelphia by landing his troops in [[Chesapeake Bay]] on August 24.&lt;ref name="V3zgZ"&gt;[[#stedman1|Stedman 1794, Vol. 1]], pp. 317–319&lt;/ref&gt; He now compounded failure to support Burgoyne by missing repeated opportunities to destroy his opponent, defeating Washington at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, then allowing him to withdraw in good order.&lt;ref name="lgid0"&gt;[[#adams1911|Adams 1911]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; After dispersing an American detachment at [[Battle of Paoli|Paoli]] on September 20, Cornwallis occupied Philadelphia on September 26, with the main force of 9,000 under Howe based just to the north at [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]].&lt;ref name="IMKqn"&gt;[[#ward1952|Ward, C. 1952]], pp. 361–362&lt;/ref&gt; Here they were [[Battle of Germantown|attacked]] by Washington on October 4, but repulsed.&lt;ref name="LEStg"&gt;[[#taffe|Taaffe 2003]], pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent Howe's forces in Philadelphia being resupplied by sea, the Patriots erected [[Fort Mifflin]] and nearby [[Fort Mercer]] on the east and west banks of the Delaware respectively, and placed [[Cheval de frise|obstacles]] in the river south of the city. This was supported by a small flotilla of [[Continental Navy]] ships on the Delaware, supplemented by the [[Pennsylvania State Navy]], commanded by [[John Hazelwood]]. An attempt by the Royal Navy to take the forts in the October 20 to 22 [[Battle of Red Bank]] failed;&lt;ref name="75GN3"&gt;[[#daughan2011|Daughan, 2011]], pp. 148–155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgeorge5"&gt;[[#mcgeorge1905|McGeorge, 1905]], pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt; a second attack captured Fort Mifflin on November 16, while Fort Mercer was abandoned two days later when Cornwallis breached the walls.&lt;ref name="OKOhj"&gt;[[#cadwalader1901|Cadwalader 1901]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; His supply lines secured, Howe tried to tempt Washington into giving battle, but after inconclusive skirmishing at the [[Battle of White Marsh]] from December 5 to 8, he withdrew to Philadelphia for the winter.&lt;ref name="Hlf4h"&gt;[[#cadwalader1901|Cadwalader 1901]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vergennes, Charles Gravier comte de.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|alt=portrait of French Foreign Minister Vergennes|[[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Charles, comte de Vergennes]]&lt;br /&gt;French Foreign Minister negotiated&lt;br /&gt;[[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Franco-American treaties]] Feb 1778]]

Like his predecessors, French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] considered the 1763 Peace a national humiliation and viewed the war as an opportunity to weaken Britain. He initially avoided open conflict, but allowed American ships to take on cargoes in French ports, a technical violation of neutrality.&lt;ref name="RQia1"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Although public opinion favored the American cause, [[Controller-General of Finances|Finance Minister]] [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] argued they did not need French help to gain independence and war was too expensive. Instead, Vergennes persuaded [[Louis XVI]] to secretly fund a [[Roderigue Hortalez and Company|government front company]] to purchase munitions for the Patriots, carried in neutral Dutch ships and imported through [[Sint Eustatius]] in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="7Emll"&gt;[[#jones2002|Jones 2002]], pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Americans opposed a French alliance, fearing to "exchange one tyranny for another", but this changed after a series of military setbacks in early 1776. As France had nothing to gain from the colonies reconciling with Britain, Congress had three choices; making peace on British terms, continuing the struggle on their own, or proclaiming independence, guaranteed by France. Although the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 had wide public support, Adams was among those reluctant to pay the price of an alliance with France, and over 20% of Congressmen voted against it.&lt;ref name="m8HfD"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; Congress agreed to the treaty with reluctance and as the war moved in their favor increasingly lost interest in it.&lt;ref name="Jh722"&gt;[[#chambers1999|Chambers 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silas Deane]] was sent to Paris to begin negotiations with Vergennes, whose key objectives were replacing Britain as the United States' primary commercial and military partner, while securing the [[French West Indies]] from American expansion.&lt;ref name="AxPnm"&gt;[[#chambers2004|Chambers 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; These islands were extremely valuable; in 1772, the value of sugar and coffee produced by [[Saint-Domingue]] on its own exceeded that of all American exports combined.&lt;ref name="XpW61"&gt;[[#eclov2013|Eclov 2013]] pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Talks progressed slowly until October 1777, when British defeat at Saratoga and their apparent willingness to negotiate peace convinced Vergennes only a permanent alliance could prevent the "disaster" of Anglo-American rapprochement. Assurances of formal French support allowed Congress to reject the Carlisle Peace Commission and insist on nothing short of complete independence.&lt;ref name="LV00I"&gt;[[#stockley2001|Stockley 2001]], pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1778, France and the United States signed the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (France–United States)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] regulating trade between the two countries, followed by a defensive military alliance against Britain, the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]. In return for French guarantees of American independence, Congress undertook to defend their interests in the West Indies, while both sides agreed not to make a separate peace; conflict over these provisions would lead to the 1798 to 1800 [[Quasi-War]].&lt;ref name="Jh722" /&gt; [[Charles III of Spain]] was invited to join on the same terms but refused, largely due to concerns over the impact of the Revolution on Spanish colonies in the Americas. Spain had complained on multiple occasions about encroachment by American settlers into [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]], a problem that could only get worse once the United States replaced Britain.&lt;ref name="cLbUe"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Renouf |first=Stephen |title=Spain in the American Revolution |url=https://members.sar.org/media/uploads/pages/309/TJx3jcf0O6up.pdf |access-date=7 December 2020 |website=Spain Society; SAR |publisher=sar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spain ultimately made important contributions to American success, in the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)]], Charles agreed only to support [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|France's war with Britain]] outside America, in return for help in recovering [[Gibraltar]], [[Menorca]] and [[Spanish Florida]].&lt;ref name="1WkNc"&gt;[[#davenport1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; The terms were confidential since several conflicted with American aims; for example, the French claimed exclusive control of the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a non-negotiable for colonies like Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Zpiql"&gt;[[#davenport1917|Davenport 1917]], p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; One less well-known impact of this agreement was the abiding American distrust of 'foreign entanglements'; the US would not sign another treaty until the [[NATO]] agreement in 1949.&lt;ref name="Jh722" /&gt; This was because the US had agreed not to make peace without France, while Aranjuez committed France to keep fighting until Spain recovered Gibraltar, effectively making it a condition of US independence without the knowledge of Congress.&lt;ref name="Sj8Yw"&gt;[[#weeks2013|Weeks 2013]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

To encourage French participation in the struggle for independence, the US representative in Paris, [[Silas Deane]] promised promotion and command positions to any French officer who joined the Continental Army. Although many proved incompetent, one outstanding exception was [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]], whom Congress appointed a major General.&lt;ref name="oss0k"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his military ability, Lafayette showed considerable political skill in building support for Washington among his officers and within Congress, liaising with French army and naval commanders, and promoting the Patriot cause in France.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

When the war started, Britain tried to borrow the Dutch-based [[Scots Brigade]] for service in America, but pro-Patriot sentiment led the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] to refuse.&lt;ref name="REc39"&gt;[[#edler|Edler 2001]]&amp;nbsp;[1911], pp. 28–32&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Republic was no longer a major power, prior to 1774 they still dominated the European carrying trade, and Dutch merchants made large profits shipping French-supplied munitions to the Patriots. This ended when Britain [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|declared war]] in December 1780, a conflict that proved disastrous to the Dutch economy.&lt;ref name="2mejD"&gt;[[#scott1988|Scott 1988]], pp. 572–573&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch were also excluded from the [[First League of Armed Neutrality]], formed by Russia, Sweden and Denmark in March 1780 to protect neutral shipping from being stopped and searched for contraband by Britain and France.&lt;ref name="SHwIx"&gt;[[#grainger2005|Grainger 2005]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government failed to take into account the strength of the American merchant marine and support from European countries, which allowed the colonies to import munitions and continue trading with relative impunity. While well aware of this, the North administration delayed placing the Royal Navy on a war footing for cost reasons; this prevented the institution of an effective blockade and restricted them to ineffectual diplomatic protests.&lt;ref name="vh541"&gt;[[#syrett1998|Syrett 1998]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional British policy was to employ European land-based allies to divert the opposition, a role filled by Prussia in the Seven Years' War; in 1778, they were diplomatically isolated and faced war on multiple fronts.&lt;ref name="30Yfr"&gt;[[#syrett1998|Syrett 1998]], pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, George III had given up on subduing America while Britain had a European war to fight.&lt;ref name="BNJcV"&gt;[[#ferling2013|Ferling 2007]], p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; He did not welcome war with France, but he believed the [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|British victories over France]] in the Seven Years' War as a reason to believe in ultimate victory over France.&lt;ref name="0Xa9K"&gt;[[#syrett1998|Syrett 1998]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Britain could not find a powerful ally among the Great Powers to engage France on the European continent.&lt;ref name="PM5Vx"&gt;[[#scott1990|Scott 1990]], pp. 264–272&lt;/ref&gt; Britain subsequently changed its focus into the Caribbean theater,&lt;ref name="bdwF7"&gt;[[#syrett1998|Syrett 1998]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and diverted major military resources away from America.&lt;ref name="uPqly"&gt;[[#higginbotham1983|Higginbotham 1983]]&amp;nbsp;[1971], pp. 175–188&lt;/ref&gt;

That midnight, the newly installed Clinton continued his retreat to New York.&lt;ref name="ru2b1"&gt;[[#chernow2010|Chernow 2010 (2011)]], p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

A French naval force under Admiral [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing]] was sent to assist Washington; deciding New York was too formidable a target, in August they launched a combined attack on Newport, with General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] commanding land forces.&lt;ref name="2fC9I"&gt;[[#morrissey1997|Morrissey 2004]], pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Battle of Rhode Island]] was indecisive; badly damaged by a storm, the French withdrew to avoid putting their ships at risk.&lt;ref name="hGItT"&gt;[[#daughan2011|Daughan 2011]]&amp;nbsp;[2008], pp. 174–176&lt;/ref&gt; Further activity was limited to British raids on [[Battle of Chestnut Neck|Chestnut Neck]] and [[The Affair at Little Egg Harbor|Little Egg Harbor]] in October.&lt;ref name="aNa6z"&gt;[[#goos|Goos]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The war to the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] was largely confined to skirmishing and raids.

On May 25, 1780, British Colonel Henry Bird [[Bird's invasion of Kentucky|invaded Kentucky]] as part of a wider operation to clear American resistance from Quebec to the Gulf coast. Their Pensacola advance on New Orleans was overcome by Spanish Governor Gálvez's offensive on Mobile. Simultaneous British attacks were repulsed on [[Battle of St. Louis|St. Louis]] by the Spanish Lieutenant Governor [[Fernando de Leyba|de Leyba]], and on the [[Illinois County, Virginia|Virginia county courthouse]] at [[Cahokia, Illinois#History|Cahokia]] by Lieutenant Colonel Clark. The British initiative under Bird from Detroit was ended at the rumored approach of Clark.{{Efn|Bird's expedition numbered 150 British soldiers, several hundred Loyalists, and 700 Shawnee, Wyandot and Ottawa auxiliaries. The force skirted into the eastern regions of Patriot-conquered western Quebec that had been annexed as [[Illinois County, Virginia]]. His target was Virginia militia stationed at [[Fort-on-Shore|Lexington]]. As they approached downriver on the Ohio River, rumor among the Indians spread that the feared Colonel Clark had discovered their approach. Bird's Indians and Loyalists abandoned their mission 90 miles upriver to loot settlements at the [[Licking River (Kentucky)#History|Licking River]]. At the surrender of Ruddles Station, safe passage to families was promised, but 200 were massacred by Indian raiders. Grenier maintains that "The slaughter the Indians and rangers perpetrated was unprecedented".}} The scale of violence in the [[Licking River (Kentucky)#History|Licking River Valley]], such as during the [[Battle of Blue Licks]], was extreme "even for frontier standards".

The "Southern Strategy" was developed by Lord Germain, based on input from London-based Loyalists like Joseph Galloway. They argued it made no sense to fight the Patriots in the north where they were strongest, while the New England economy was reliant on trade with Britain, regardless of who governed it. On the other hand, duties on tobacco made the South far more profitable for Britain, while local support meant securing it required small numbers of regular troops. Victory would leave a truncated United States facing British possessions in the south, Canada to the north, and Ohio on their western border; with the Atlantic seaboard controlled by the Royal Navy, Congress would be forced to agree to terms. However, assumptions about the level of Loyalist support proved wildly optimistic.&lt;ref name="WmAJ5"&gt;[[#pearson1993|Pearson 1993]], pp. 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Germain accordingly ordered [[Augustine Prévost]], the British commander in [[East Florida]], to advance into [[Georgia in the American Revolution#Return of the British Army|Georgia]] in December 1778. [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer, born 1739)|Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell]], an experienced officer taken prisoner earlier in the war before being exchanged for Ethan Allen, [[Capture of Savannah|captured Savannah]] on December 29, 1778. He recruited a Loyalist militia of nearly 1,100, many of whom allegedly joined only after Campbell threatened to confiscate their property.&lt;ref name="oVXIX"&gt;[[#wilson2005|Wilson 2005]], p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Poor motivation and training made them unreliable troops, as demonstrated in their defeat by Patriot militia at the [[Battle of Kettle Creek]] on February 14, 1779, although this was offset by British victory at [[Battle of Brier Creek|Brier Creek]] on March 3.&lt;ref name="eTiqi"&gt;[[#morrill|Morrill 1993]], pp. 46–50&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Prévost launched an abortive assault on Charleston, before retreating to Savannah, an operation notorious for widespread looting by British troops that enraged both Loyalists and Patriots. In October, a joint French and American operation under Admiral [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] and General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] failed to [[Siege of Savannah|recapture Savannah]].&lt;ref name="yBaSD"&gt;[[#wilson2005|Wilson 2005]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Prévost was replaced by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], who assumed responsibility for Germain's strategy; he soon realized estimates of Loyalist support were considerably over-stated, and he needed far larger numbers of regular forces.&lt;ref name="fDcs9"&gt;[[#pearson1993|Pearson 1993]], pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinforced by Clinton, his troops [[Siege of Charleston|captured Charleston]] in May 1780, inflicting the most serious Patriot defeat of the war; over 5,000 prisoners were taken and the Continental Army in the south effectively destroyed. On May 29, Loyalist regular [[Banastre Tarleton]] defeated an American force of 400 at the [[Battle of Waxhaws]]; over 120 were killed, many allegedly after surrendering. Responsibility is disputed, Loyalists claiming Tarleton was shot at while negotiating terms of surrender, but it was later used as a recruiting tool by the Patriots.&lt;ref name="9sQwG"&gt;[[#piecuch2004|Piecuch 2004]], pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton returned to New York, leaving Cornwallis to oversee the south; despite their success, the two men left barely on speaking terms, with dire consequences for the future conduct of the war.&lt;ref name="zCa8T"&gt;[[#borick2003|Borick 2003]], pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern strategy depended on local support, but this was undermined by a series of coercive measures. Previously, captured Patriots were sent home after swearing not to take up arms against the king; they were now required to fight their former comrades, while the confiscation of Patriot-owned plantations led formerly neutral "[[grandee]]s" to side with them.&lt;ref name="UE0Rz"&gt;[[#gordon|Gordon and Keegan 2007]], pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Skirmishes at [[Battle of Williamson's Plantation|Williamson's Plantation]], Cedar Springs, [[Battle of Rocky Mount|Rocky Mount]], and [[Battle of Hanging Rock|Hanging Rock]] signaled widespread resistance to the new oaths throughout South Carolina.&lt;ref name="eJXda"&gt;[[#gordon|Gordon and Keegan 2007]], pp. 88–92&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, Congress appointed General [[Horatio Gates]] commander in the south; he was defeated at the [[Battle of Camden]] on August 16, leaving Cornwallis free to enter North Carolina.&lt;ref name="CR0we"&gt;[[#rankin|Rankin 2011]]&amp;nbsp;[1996], p.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite battlefield success, the British could not control the countryside and Patriot attacks continued; before moving north, Cornwallis sent Loyalist militia under Major [[Patrick Ferguson]] to cover his left flank, leaving their forces too far apart to provide mutual support.&lt;ref name="P43ob"&gt;[[#buchanan97|Buchanan 1997]], p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, Ferguson was defeated at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], dispersing organized Loyalist resistance in the region.&lt;ref name="6Dbvn"&gt;[[#Ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 459–461&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Cornwallis continued into North Carolina hoping for Loyalist support, while Washington replaced Gates with General [[Nathanael Greene]] in December 1780.&lt;ref name="MsfX6"&gt;[[#buchanan97|Buchanan 1997]], p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene divided his army, leading his main force southeast pursued by Cornwallis; a detachment was sent southwest under [[Daniel Morgan]], who defeated Tarleton's [[British Legion (American Revolution)|British Legion]] at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, nearly eliminating it as a fighting force.&lt;ref name="Y8Aqz"&gt;[[#golway2005|Golway 2005]], pp. 238–242&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriots now held the initiative in the south, with the exception of a [[Raid of Richmond|raid on Richmond]] led by Benedict Arnold in January 1781.&lt;ref name="kFdPt"&gt;[[#peterson1975|Peterson 1975]]&amp;nbsp;[1970], pp. 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; Greene led Cornwallis on a series of countermarches around North Carolina; by early March, the British were exhausted and short of supplies and Greene felt strong enough to fight the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] on March 15. Although victorious, Cornwallis suffered heavy casualties and retreated to [[Wilmington, North Carolina#Revolutionary era|Wilmington, North Carolina]] seeking supplies and reinforcements.&lt;ref name="NcMDc"&gt;[[#buchanan97|Buchanan 1997]], p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patriots now controlled most of the Carolinas and Georgia outside the coastal areas; after a minor reversal at the [[Battle of Hobkirk's Hill]], they recaptured [[Siege of Fort Watson|Fort Watson]] and [[Siege of Fort Motte|Fort Motte]] on April 15.&lt;ref name="Sfu2K"&gt;[[#fgreene1913|Greene, F. 1913]], pp. 234–237&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, Brigadier General [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]] captured [[Siege of Augusta|Augusta]], leaving the British in Georgia confined to Charleston and Savannah.&lt;ref name="ei9uo"&gt;[[#reynolds2012|Reynolds 2012]], pp. 255–277&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption Loyalists would do most of the fighting left the British short of troops and battlefield victories came at the cost of losses they could not replace. Despite halting Greene's advance at the [[Battle of Eutaw Springs]] on September 8, Cornwallis withdrew to Charleston with little to show for his campaign.&lt;ref name="Mn9U7"&gt;[[#pancake1985|Pancake 1985]], p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spain joined France's war against Britain in 1779, [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|their treaty]] specifically excluded Spanish military action in North America. However, from the beginning of the war, [[Bernardo de Gálvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston|Bernardo de Gálvez]], the [[List of colonial governors of Louisiana|Governor of Spanish Louisiana]], allowed the Americans to import supplies and munitions into [[History of New Orleans#Spanish interregnum|New Orleans]], then ship them to [[History of Pittsburgh#Gateway to the West (1763–1799)|Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="sDaXP"&gt;[[#narrett2015|Narrett 2015]], p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; This provided an alternative transportation route for the Continental Army, bypassing the British blockade of the Atlantic Coast.&lt;ref name="T3jCI"&gt;[[#chavez|Chavez 2002]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade was organized by [[Oliver Pollock]], a successful merchant in Havana and New Orleans who was appointed US "commercial agent".&lt;ref name="vSMcK"&gt;[[#narrett2015|Narrett 2015]], p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; It also helped support the American [[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|campaign in the west]]; in the 1778 [[Illinois campaign]], militia under General [[George Rogers Clark]] cleared the British from what was then part of [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]], creating [[Illinois County, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Xrfxx"&gt;[[#butterfield|Butterfield 1903]], pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite official neutrality, Gálvez initiated offensive operations against British outposts.&lt;ref name="lGgZh"&gt;[[#chavez|Chávez 2002]], p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; First, he cleared British garrisons in [[History of Baton Rouge, Louisiana#1763–1779: British period|Baton Rouge]], [[History of Louisiana#Spanish interregnum (1763–1803)|Louisiana]], [[Fort Bute]], and [[History of Natchez, Mississippi#Colonial history (1716–1783)|Natchez]], [[History of Mississippi#European colonial period|Mississippi]], and captured five forts.&lt;ref name="zQHJI"&gt;[[#carlos|Don Jaun Carlos I 1979]], speech&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Gálvez opened navigation on the Mississippi River north to the American settlement in Pittsburg.&lt;ref name="ipFTR"&gt;[[#Deane2018|Deane 2018]], "Spanish New Orleans helped America"&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton spent most of 1781 based in New York City; he failed to construct a coherent operational strategy, partly due to his difficult relationship with Admiral [[Marriot Arbuthnot]].&lt;ref name="ap5wX"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; In Charleston, Cornwallis independently developed an aggressive plan for a campaign in Virginia, which he hoped would isolate Greene's army in the Carolinas and cause the collapse of Patriot resistance in the South. This was approved by Lord Germain in London, but neither of them informed Clinton.&lt;ref name="mnb58"&gt;[[#ketchum2014b|Ketchum 2014b]], pp. 423, 520&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] now discussed their options; the former wanted to attack New York, the latter Virginia, where Cornwallis' forces were less well-established and thus easier to defeat.&lt;ref name="xzQbp"&gt;[[#ketchum2014b|Ketchum 2014b]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Washington eventually gave way and Lafayette took a combined Franco-American force into Virginia,&lt;ref name="bsnMy"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 526–529&lt;/ref&gt; but Clinton misinterpreted his movements as preparations for an attack on New York. Concerned by this threat, he instructed Cornwallis to establish a fortified sea base where the Royal Navy could evacuate his troops to help defend New York.&lt;ref name="b3QwE"&gt;[[#grainger2005|Grainger 2005]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lafayette entered Virginia, Cornwallis complied with Clinton's orders and withdrew to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], where he constructed strong defenses and awaited evacuation.&lt;ref name="SkAo5"&gt;[[#taylor2016|Taylor 2016]], pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement by the Spanish navy to defend the French West Indies allowed Admiral [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|de Grasse]] to relocate to the Atlantic seaboard, a move Arbuthnot did not anticipate.&lt;ref name="ap5wX" /&gt; This provided Lafayette naval support, while the failure of previous combined operations at Newport and Savannah meant their co-ordination was planned more carefully.&lt;ref name="6XKWu"&gt;[[#dull1975|Dull 2015]]&amp;nbsp;[1975], pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; Despite repeated urging from his subordinates, Cornwallis made no attempt to engage Lafayette before he could establish siege lines.&lt;ref name="jzAf8"&gt;[[#ketchum2014b|Ketchum 2014b]], p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Even worse, expecting to be withdrawn within a few days he abandoned the outer defenses, which were promptly occupied by the besiegers and hastened British defeat.&lt;ref name="4QJnx"&gt;[[#lengel2005|Lengel 2005]], p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, a British fleet under [[Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves|Thomas Graves]] left New York for Yorktown.&lt;ref name="xdltf"&gt;[[#middleton2014|Middleton 2014]], pp. 29–43&lt;/ref&gt; After landing troops and munitions for the besiegers on August 30, de Grasse had remained in Chesapeake Bay and intercepted him on September 5; although the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] was indecisive in terms of losses, Graves was forced to retreat, leaving Cornwallis isolated.&lt;ref name="pTsmW"&gt;[[#black1992|Black 1992]], p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; An attempted breakout over the York River at [[Gloucester County, Virginia#Gloucester County formation and divisions|Gloucester Point]] failed due to bad weather.&lt;ref name="0d9W7"&gt;[[#dale2005|Dale 2005]], pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Under heavy bombardment with dwindling supplies, Cornwallis felt his situation was hopeless and on October 16 sent emissaries to Washington to negotiate surrender; after twelve hours of negotiations, these were finalized the next day.&lt;ref name="g66wL"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 534–535&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for defeat was the subject of fierce public debate between Cornwallis, Clinton and Germain. Despite criticism from his junior officers, Cornwallis retained the confidence of his peers and later held a series of senior government positions; Clinton ultimately took most of the blame and spent the rest of his life in obscurity.&lt;ref name="irWjD"&gt;[[#middleton2014|Middleton 2014]], pp. 370–372&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to Yorktown, American forces were assigned to supervise the armistice between Washington and Clinton made to facilitate British departure following the January 1782 law of Parliament forbidding any further British offensive action in North America. British-American negotiations in Paris led to preliminaries signed November 1782 acknowledging US independence. The enacted Congressional war aim for British withdrawal from its North American claims to be ceded to the US was completed for the coastal cities in stages.&lt;ref name="OtLkf"&gt;[[#ferling2003|Ferling 2003]], pp. 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, Generals Greene and Wayne loosely invested the withdrawing British at Savanna and Charleston. There they observed the British finally taking off their regulars from Charleston December 14, 1782.&lt;ref name="FF82B"&gt;[[#fiske1902|Fiske 1902]], p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalist provincial militias of whites and free blacks, as well as Loyalists with their slaves were transported in a relocation to Nova Scotia and the British Caribbean.{{efn|In Nova Scotia, a province that had been a Massachusetts county in the 1600s, British settlement of freed black Loyalists from the American Revolutionary War secured its Canadian claim there.

At that time, Congress decommissioned the regiments of Washington's Continental Army and began issuing land grants to veterans in the Northwest Territories for their war service. The last of the British occupation of New York City ended on November 25, 1783 with the departure of Clinton's replacement, General Sir [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]].&lt;ref name="Xx5DW"&gt;[[#fleming2006|Fleming 2006]], p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

To win their insurrection, the Americans needed to outlast the British will to continue the fight. To restore the empire, the British had to defeat the Continental Army in the early months, and compel the Congress to dissolve itself.&lt;ref name="I7Xou"&gt;[[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Terry M. Mays identifies three separate types of warfare, the first being a colonial conflict in which objections to Imperial trade regulation were as significant as taxation policy. The second was a civil war with all thirteen states split between Patriots, Loyalists and those who preferred to remain neutral. Particularly in the south, many battles were fought between Patriots and Loyalists with no British involvement, leading to divisions that continued after independence was achieved.&lt;ref name="StQAE"&gt;[[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The third element was a global war between France, Spain, the Dutch Republic and Britain, with America as one of a number of different theaters.&lt;ref name="StQAE" /&gt; After entering the war in 1778, France provided the Americans money, weapons, soldiers, and naval assistance, while French troops fought under US command in North America. While Spain did not formally join the war in America, they provided access to the Mississippi River and by capturing British possessions on the Gulf of Mexico denied bases to the Royal Navy, as well as retaking [[Menorca]] and besieging [[Gibraltar]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="ONzWM"&gt;[[#davenport1917|Davenport 1917]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Dutch Republic was no longer a major power, prior to 1774 they still dominated the European carrying trade, and Dutch merchants made large profits by shipping French-supplied munitions to the Patriots. This ended when Britain [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|declared war]] in December 1780 and the conflict proved disastrous to their economy.&lt;ref name="72JXk"&gt;[[#Scott|Scott 1988]], pp. 572–573&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch were also excluded from the [[First League of Armed Neutrality]], formed by Russia, Sweden and Denmark in March 1780 to protect neutral shipping from being stopped and searched for contraband by Britain and France.&lt;ref name="SHwIx" /&gt; While of limited effect, these interventions forced the British to divert men and resources away from North America.&lt;ref name="DEcPu" /&gt;

Congress had multiple advantages if the rebellion turned into a protracted war. Their prosperous state populations depended on local production for food and supplies rather than on imports from their mother country that lay six to twelve weeks away by sail. They were spread across most of the North American Atlantic seaboard, stretching 1,000 miles. Most farms were remote from the seaports, and controlling four or five major ports did not give British armies control over the inland areas. Each state had established internal distribution systems.&lt;ref name="lNS5K"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], pp. 36–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Each former colony had a long-established system of local militia, combat-tested in support of British regulars thirteen years before to secure an expanded British Empire. Together they took away French claims in North America west to the Mississippi River in the [[French and Indian War]]. The state legislatures independently funded and controlled their local militias. In the American Revolution, they trained and provided Continental Line regiments to the regular army, each with their own state officer corps.&lt;ref name="lNS5K" /&gt; Motivation was also a major asset: each colonial capital had its own newspapers and printers, and the Patriots had more popular support than the Loyalists. British hoped that the Loyalists would do much of the fighting, but they fought less than expected.&lt;ref name="6bqxv" /&gt;

===Continental Army===

[[File:George Washington, 1776.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|General Washington&lt;br /&gt;commanding the [[Continental Army]]|alt=Formal painting of General George Washington, standing in uniform, as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army]]

When the war began, Congress lacked a professional army or navy, and each colony only maintained local militias. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time and lacked the training and discipline of more experienced soldiers. Local county militias were reluctant to travel far from home and they were unavailable for extended operations.&lt;ref name="JOPiQ"&gt;[[#black2001|Black 2001]]&amp;nbsp;[1991], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate for this, Congress established a regular force known as the Continental Army on June 14, 1775, the origin of the modern [[United States Army]], and appointed Washington as commander-in-chief. However, it suffered significantly from the lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants, offset by a few senior officers.&lt;ref name="4DbAi"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 286–287&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state legislature appointed officers for both county and state militias and their regimental Continental Line officers; although Washington was required to accept Congressional appointments, he was still permitted to choose and command his own generals, such as [[Nathanael Greene]], his chief of artillery, [[Henry Knox]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]], the chief of staff.&lt;ref name="pSJBj"&gt;[[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham 1987]], Chap.3&lt;/ref&gt; One of Washington's most successful recruits to general officer was Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff who wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].&lt;ref name="4DbAi" /&gt; The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war; when properly employed, the combination allowed them to overwhelm smaller British forces, as at Concord, Boston, Bennington, and Saratoga.

Washington designed the overall military strategy of the war in cooperation with Congress, established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs, personally recruited his senior officer corps, and kept the states focused on a common goal.&lt;ref name="l3gHY"&gt;[[#lengel2005|Lengel 2005]], pp. 365–71&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three years until after [[Valley Forge]], the Continental Army was largely supplemented by local state militias. Initially, Washington employed the inexperienced officers and untrained troops in [[Fabian strategy|Fabian strategies]] rather than risk frontal assaults against Britain's professional soldiers and officers.&lt;ref name="UxzJ5"&gt;[[#ellis2004|Ellis 2004]], pp. 92–109&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the entire war, Washington lost more battles than he won, but he never surrendered his troops and maintained a fighting force in the face of British field armies and never gave up fighting for the American cause.&lt;ref name="oBjRC"&gt;[[#alexrose|Rose, A. 2014]]&amp;nbsp;[2006], pp. 258–261&lt;/ref&gt;

By prevailing European standards, the armies in America were relatively small, limited by lack of supplies and logistics; the British in particular were constrained by the difficulty of transporting troops across the Atlantic and dependence on local supplies. Washington never directly commanded more than 17,000 men,&lt;ref name="6Djag"&gt;[[#boatner74|Boatner 1974]], p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; while the combined Franco-American army at Yorktown was only about 19,000.&lt;ref name="mtUen"&gt;[[#duffy1987|Duffy 2005]]&amp;nbsp;[1987], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1776, Patriot forces consisted of 20,000 men, with two-thirds in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militia for the Revolutionary cause over eight years during wartime, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time.&lt;ref name="0HyhO"&gt;[[#crocker|Crocker 2006]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

As a whole, American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuvers, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at [[Siege of Boston|Boston]] (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) were won from trapping the British far from base with a greater number of troops.&lt;ref name="pSJBj" /&gt; Nevertheless, after 1778, Washington's army was transformed into a more disciplined and effective force, mostly by [[Baron von Steuben]]'s training.&lt;ref name="4DbAi" /&gt; Immediately after the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to match the British troops in action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], including a black Rhode Island regiment fending off a British bayonet attack then counter-charging for the first time in Washington's army.&lt;ref name="kgNGc"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; Here Washington came to realize that saving entire towns was not necessary, but preserving his army and keeping the revolutionary spirit alive was more important in the long run. Washington informed [[Henry Laurens]]{{Efn|Laurens was president of the Second Continental Congress at this time.&lt;ref name="6CNkb"&gt;Jillson and Wilson, 1994, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;}} "that the possession of our towns, while we have an army in the field, will avail them little."&lt;ref name="76ZOZ"&gt;[[#chernow2010|Chernow, 2010]], p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Congress was responsible for the war effort and provided supplies to the troops, Washington took it upon himself to pressure the Congress and state legislatures to provide the essentials of war; there was never nearly enough.&lt;ref name="CX4G4"&gt;[[#carp1990|Carp 1990]], p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Congress evolved in its committee oversight and established the Board of War, which included members of the military.&lt;ref name="rBEkF"&gt;[[#harwell2011|Freeman and Harwell (ed.)]], p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Board of War was also a committee ensnared with its own internal procedures, Congress also created the post of Secretary of War, and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] in February 1781 to the position. Washington worked closely with Lincoln to coordinate civilian and military authorities and took charge of training and supplying the army.&lt;ref name="t1m52"&gt;[[#bell2005|Bell 2005]], pp. 3–4"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4DbAi" /&gt;

Congress primarily commissioned privateers to reduce costs and to take advantage of the large proportion of colonial sailors found in the British Empire. Overall, they included 1,700 ships that successfully captured 2,283 enemy ships to damage the British effort and to enrich themselves with the proceeds from the sale of cargo and the ship itself.&lt;ref name="OVxVT"&gt;[[#pike1907|Pike 1907]], "Privateers"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|In what was known as the [[Whaleboat War]], American privateers mainly from New Jersey, Brooklyn and Connecticut attacked and robbed British merchant ships and raided and robbed coastal communities of Long Island reputed to have Loyalist sympathies.&lt;ref name="dqbl5"&gt;[[#philbrick2016|Philbrick 2016]], p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;}} About 55,000 sailors served aboard American privateers during the war.&lt;ref name="mZ9Yi" /&gt;

To begin with, the Americans had no major international allies, as most nation-states watched and waited to see developments unfold in British North America. Over time, the Continental Army acquitted itself well in the face of British regulars and their German auxiliaries known to all European great powers. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]], proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations including France and Spain, and the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War#Background|Dutch Republic]]; the latter moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them.&lt;ref name="zaqGl"&gt;[[#trevelyan1912a|Trevelyan 1912a]], p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisive American victory at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] convinced [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]] to offer the Americans the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (France–United States)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]]. The two nations also agreed to a defensive [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] to protect their trade and also guaranteed American independence from Britain. To engage the United States as a French ally militarily, the treaty was conditioned on Britain initiating a war on France to stop it from trading with the US. Spain and the Dutch Republic were invited to join by both France and the United States in the treaty, but neither made a formal reply.&lt;ref name="yOYGS"&gt;[[#morgan2012|Morgan 2012]]&amp;nbsp;[1956], pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 1778, France declared war on Great Britain, and it invoked the French military alliance with the US, which ensured additional US privateer support for French possessions in the Caribbean.{{Efn|King George III feared that the war's prospects would make it unlikely he could reclaim the North American colonies.&lt;ref name="JuC0w"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; During the later years of the Revolution, the British were drawn into numerous other conflicts about the globe.&lt;ref name="OqppY"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], pp. 405–48&lt;/ref&gt;}} Washington worked closely with the soldiers and navy that France would send to America, primarily through [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] on his staff. French assistance made critical contributions required to defeat General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] at Yorktown in 1781.&lt;ref name="fNRxX"&gt;[[#davis75|Davis 1975]], pp. 203, 303, 391&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The final elements for US victory over Britain and US independence was assured by direct military intervention from France, as well as ongoing French supply and commercial trade over the final three years of the war.&lt;ref name="jPPnA"&gt;[[#higginbotham1983|Higginbotham 1983]]&amp;nbsp;[1971], pp. 188–98&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British military had considerable experience of fighting in North America, most recently during the Seven Years' War which forced France to give up [[New France]] in 1763.&lt;ref name="cdOwo"&gt;[[#cave2004|Cave 2004]], pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; However, in previous conflicts they benefited from local logistics, as well as support from the colonial militia, which was not available in the American Revolutionary War. Reinforcements had to come from Europe, and maintaining large armies over such distances was extremely complex; ships could take three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time they arrived.&lt;ref name="HZaQ9"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], pp. 298, 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the conflict, the colonies were largely autonomous economic and political entities, with no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance.&lt;ref name="Jvdgy"&gt;[[#rosssman2016|Rossman 2016]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that, unlike Europe where the fall of a capital city often ended wars, that in America continued even after the loss of major settlements such as Philadelphia, the seat of Congress, New York and Charleston.&lt;ref name="WTNUb"&gt;[[#curtis1926|Curtis 1926]], pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; British power was reliant on the Royal Navy, whose dominance allowed them to resupply their own expeditionary forces while preventing access to enemy ports. However, the majority of the American population was agrarian, rather than urban; supported by the French navy and blockade runners based in the [[Dutch Caribbean]], their economy was able to survive.&lt;ref name="Pole 2004"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], pp. 42, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical size of the colonies and limited manpower meant the British could not simultaneously conduct military operations and occupy territory without local support. Debate persists over whether their defeat was inevitable; one British statesman described it as "like trying to conquer a map".&lt;ref name="arzue"&gt;[[#curtis1926|Curtis 1926]], p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; While [[John E. Ferling|Ferling]] argues Patriot victory was nothing short of a miracle,&lt;ref name="holEy"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 562–77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Ellis|Ellis]] suggests the odds always favored the Americans, especially after Howe squandered the chance of a decisive British success in 1776, an "opportunity that would never come again".&lt;ref name="MqYnj"&gt;[[#ellis2013|Ellis 2013]], p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; The US military history speculates the additional commitment of 10,000 fresh troops in 1780 would have placed British victory "within the realm of possibility".&lt;ref name="Ma3JT"&gt;[[#stewartR|Stewart, R. 2005]], vol. 4, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Army====
{{Main|British Army during the American Revolutionary War}}{{See also|Loyalist (American Revolution)#Military service}}
[[File:Thomas Gage John Singleton Copley.jpeg|thumb|upright=.8|left|alt=Portrait of the British commander-in-chief, Sir Thomas Gage in dress uniform.|Sir [[Thomas Gage]], British Commander, 1763–1775]]

The expulsion of France from North America in 1763 led to a drastic reduction in British troop levels in the colonies; in 1775, there were only 8,500 regular soldiers among a civilian population of 2.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="0qbek"&gt;[[#clode1869a|Clode 1869]], Vol. 1, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of military resources in the Americas were focused on defending sugar islands in the Caribbean; [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] alone generated more revenue than all thirteen American colonies combined.&lt;ref name="FJWrp"&gt;[[#billias1969|Billias 1969]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the Seven Years' War, the permanent army in Britain was also cut back, which resulted in administrative difficulties when the war began a decade later.&lt;ref name="Y118y"&gt;[[#clayton2014|Clayton 2014]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the war, there were four separate British commanders-in-chief, the first of whom was Thomas Gage; appointed in 1763, his initial focus was establishing British rule in former French areas of Canada. Rightly or wrongly, many in London blamed the revolt on his failure to take firm action earlier, and he was relieved after the heavy losses incurred at Bunker Hill.&lt;ref name="cosou"&gt;[[#nessy|O’Shaunessy 2013]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; His replacement was Sir William Howe, a member of the Whig faction in Parliament who opposed the policy of coercion advocated by Lord North; Cornwallis, who later surrendered at Yorktown, was one of many senior officers who initially refused to serve in North America.&lt;ref name="CZWL2"&gt;[[#ketchum97|Ketchum 1997]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1775 campaign showed the British overestimated the capabilities of their own troops and underestimated the colonial militia, requiring a reassessment of tactics and strategy.&lt;ref name="pWpln"&gt;[[#ketchum2014a|Ketchum 2014a]], p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; However, it allowed the Patriots to take the initiative and British authorities rapidly lost control over every colony.&lt;ref name="57mVs"&gt;[[#miller1959|Miller 1959]], pp. 410–12&lt;/ref&gt; Howe's responsibility is still debated; despite receiving large numbers of reinforcements, Bunker Hill seems to have permanently affected his self-confidence and lack of tactical flexibility meant he often failed to follow up opportunities.&lt;ref name="r4hyC"&gt;[[#fleming2006|Fleming 2006]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his decisions were attributed to supply problems, such as the delay in launching the New York campaign and failure to pursue Washington's beaten army.&lt;ref name="MlUcq"&gt;[[#daviesk1972|Davies, K. 1972]], vol. 12-1776, 5:93, Howe to Germain, June 7 and July 7, 1776&lt;/ref&gt; Having lost the confidence of his subordinates, he was recalled after Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga.&lt;ref name="UkMe5"&gt;[[#nessy|O’Shaunessy 2013]], p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the failure of the Carlisle Commission, British policy changed from treating the Patriots as subjects who needed to be reconciled to enemies who had to be defeated.&lt;ref name="o6DjZ"&gt;[[#hibbert2000|Hibbert 2000]], pp. 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, Howe was replaced by Sir Henry Clinton, appointed instead of Carleton who was considered overly cautious.&lt;ref name="eA9wm"&gt;[[#nessy|O’Shaunessy 2013]], p.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as an expert on tactics and strategy,&lt;ref name="UkMe5" /&gt; like his predecessors Clinton was handicapped by chronic supply issues.&lt;ref name="BZg2c"&gt;[[#daviesk1972|Davies, K. 1972]], vol. 15-1778, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, September 15, 1778&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was largely inactive in 1779 and much of 1780; in October 1780, he warned Germain of "fatal consequences" if matters did not improve.&lt;ref name="GYJyS"&gt;[[#daviesk1972|Davies, K. 1972]], vol. 18-1780, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, October 31, 1780&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Clinton's strategy was compromised by conflict with political superiors in London and his colleagues in North America, especially Admiral [[Mariot Arbuthnot]], replaced in early 1781 by Rodney.&lt;ref name="ap5wX" /&gt; He was neither notified nor consulted when Germain approved Cornwallis' invasion of the south in 1781 and delayed sending him reinforcements believing the bulk of Washington's army was still outside New York City.&lt;ref name="mWJRm"&gt;[[#ketchum2014b|Ketchum 2014b]], pp. 208–210&lt;/ref&gt; After the surrender at Yorktown, Clinton was relieved by Carleton, whose major task was to oversee the evacuation of Loyalists and British troops from Savannah, Charleston, and New York City.&lt;ref name="YZsHH"&gt;[[#cashin|Cashin 2005]], "Revolutionary War in Georgia"&lt;/ref&gt;

====German Troops====
{{Main|Hessian (soldier)}}
[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|left|alt=Portrait of the British commander-in-chief, Sir Henry Clinton in dress uniform.|Sir [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]], British Commander, 1778–1782]]

During the 18th century, all states commonly hired foreign soldiers, especially Britain; during the Seven Years' War, they comprised 10% of the British army and their use caused little debate.&lt;ref name="jSAGZ"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear additional troops were needed to suppress the revolt in America, it was decided to employ mercenaries. There were several reasons for this, including public sympathy for the Patriot cause, an historical reluctance to expand the British army and the time needed to recruit and train new regiments.&lt;ref name="cCTlC"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate source was readily available in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], where many smaller states had a long tradition of renting their armies to the highest bidder. The most important was [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Cassel]], known as "the Mercenary State".&lt;ref name="NNZE8"&gt;[[#showalter2007|Showalter 2007]], "Best armies money could buy"&lt;/ref&gt;

The first supply agreements were signed by the North administration in late 1775; over the next decade, more than 40,000 Germans fought in North America, Gibraltar, South Africa and India, of whom 30,000 served in the American War.&lt;ref name="btSGH"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; Often generically referred to as "Hessians", they included men from many other states, including [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] and [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]].&lt;ref name="srbv4"&gt;[[#fetter1980|Fetter 1980]], p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Henry Clinton recommended recruiting Russian troops whom he rated very highly, having seen them in action against the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Ottomans]]; however, negotiations with [[Catherine the Great]] made little progress.&lt;ref name="IqLsU"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike previous wars their use led to intense political debate in Britain, France, and even Germany, where [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] refused to provide passage through his territories for troops hired for the American war.&lt;ref name="schmidt208-209"&gt;[[#schmidt1958|Schmidt 1958]], pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1776, the agreements were challenged in Parliament by Whigs who objected to "coercion" in general, and the use of foreign soldiers to subdue "British subjects".&lt;ref name="vyLv6"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], pp. 121, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; The debates were covered in detail by American newspapers, which reprinted key speeches and in May 1776 they received copies of the treaties themselves. Provided by British sympathizers, these were smuggled into North America from London by George Merchant, a recently released American prisoner.&lt;ref name="tIwST"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of mercenaries being used in the colonies bolstered support for independence, more so than taxation and other acts combined; the King was accused of declaring war on his own subjects, leading to the idea there were now two separate governments.&lt;ref name="ImWYT"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], pp. 136–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="juHEN"&gt;[[#oshaughnessy2004|O'Saughnessy, 2004]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; By apparently showing Britain was determined to go to war, it made hopes of reconciliation seem naive and hopeless, while the employment of 'foreign mercenaries' became one of the charges levelled against George III in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref name="schmidt208-209" /&gt; The Hessian reputation within Germany for brutality also increased support for the Patriot cause among German-American immigrants.&lt;ref name="taPBr"&gt;[[#baer2015|Baer 2015]], p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of over 150,000 German-Americans meant both sides felt these mercenaries might be persuaded to desert; one reason Clinton suggested employing Russians was that he felt they were less likely to defect. When the first German troops arrived on [[Staten Island]] in August 1776, Congress approved the printing of "handbills" promising land and citizenship to any willing to join the Patriot cause. The British launched a counter-campaign claiming deserters could well be executed for meddling in a war that was not theirs.&lt;ref name="mauch415"&gt;[[#mauch2003|Mauch 2003]], p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Desertion among the Germans occurred throughout the war, with the highest rate of desertion occurring during the time between the surrender at Yorktown and the Treaty of Paris.&lt;ref name="Nf6u9"&gt;[[#atwood2002|Atwood, 2002]], p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; German regiments were central to the British war effort; of the estimated 30,000 sent to America, some 13,000 became casualties.&lt;ref name="bnmql"&gt;[[#lowell84|Lowell 1884]], pp. 20–21, 282–283&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy Loyalists convinced the British government that most of the colonists were sympathetic toward the Crown;&lt;ref name="6cWCe"&gt;[[#ritcheson|Ritcheson 1973]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, British military planners relied on recruiting Loyalists, but had trouble recruiting sufficient numbers as the Patriots had widespread support.&lt;ref name="JOPiQ" /&gt;{{Efn|On militia see Boatner 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;707;&lt;br /&gt;Weigley 1973, ch.&amp;nbsp;2}} Nevertheless, they continued to deceive themselves on their level of American support as late as 1780, a year before hostilities ended.&lt;ref name="5Kbsw"&gt;[[#lecky3|Lecky 1892]]&amp;nbsp;vol. 3, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 25,000 Loyalists fought for the British throughout the war.&lt;ref name="avZkg" /&gt; Although Loyalists constituted about twenty percent of the colonial population,&lt;ref name="Greene p. 235" /&gt; they were concentrated in distinct communities. Many of them lived among large plantation owners in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater region]] and [[South Carolina in the American Revolution#Early conflicts|South Carolina]] who produced cash crops in tobacco and indigo comparable to global markets in Caribbean sugar.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 235" /&gt;[[File:KingsMountain DeathOfFerguson Chappel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=A wounded British officer falls from his horse after being struck by gunfire; another British officer to his rights puts his hands forwards to support the wounded rider; troops skirmish in the background; men lie dead at the riders feet.|[[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution#The British turn to the South|Loyalist militia]] routed by Patriot militia at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|Kings Mountain]] withdrew into South Carolina. Victory raised American morale.]]

When the British began probing the backcountry in 1777–1778, they were faced with a major problem: any significant level of organized Loyalist activity required a continued presence of British regulars.&lt;ref name="Gu69t"&gt;[[#black2001|Black 2001]]&amp;nbsp;[1991], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The available manpower that the British had in America was insufficient to protect Loyalist territory and counter American offensives.&lt;ref name="xeYC7"&gt;[[#black2001|Black 2001]]&amp;nbsp;[1991], pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; The Loyalist militias in the South were constantly defeated by neighboring Patriot militia. The most critical combat between the two partisan militias was at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]]; the Patriot victory irreversibly crippled any further Loyalist militia capability in the South.&lt;ref name="NcMDc" /&gt;

When the early war policy was administered by General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], the Crown's need to maintain Loyalist support prevented it from using the traditional revolt suppression methods.&lt;ref name="m4e3v"&gt;[[#black2001|Black 2001]]&amp;nbsp;[1991], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The British cause suffered when their troops ransacked local homes during an aborted attack on Charleston in 1779 that enraged both Patriots and Loyalists.&lt;ref name="yBaSD" /&gt; After Congress rejected the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] in 1778 and Westminster turned to "hard war" during Clinton's command, neutral colonists in the Carolinas often allied with the Patriots whenever brutal combat broke out between Tories and Whigs.&lt;ref name="dh9oI"&gt;[[#black|Black 2001]]&amp;nbsp;[1991], pp. 14–16; pp. 35, 38; p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Loyalists gained support when Patriots intimidated suspected Tories by destroying property or [[tarring and feathering]].&lt;ref name="4VC7B"&gt;[[#Calhoon1973|Calhoon 1973]], p.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Loyalist militia unit—the [[British Legion (American Revolution)|British Legion]]—provided some of the best troops in British service that it received a commission in the British Army:&lt;!-- Add citation for Babits 1998? --&gt;&lt;ref name="b5poP"&gt;[[#buchanan97|Buchanan 1997]], p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; it was a mixed regiment of 250 [[dragoon]]s and 200 infantry supported by batteries of flying artillery.&lt;ref name="babits"&gt;[[#babits|Babits 2011]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|"British Legion Infantry strength at Cowpens was between 200 and 271 enlisted men". However, this statement is referenced to a note on pp. 175–76, which says, "The British Legion infantry at Cowpens is usually considered to have had about 200–250 men, but returns for the 25 December 1780 muster show only 175. Totals obtained by Cornwallis, dated 15 January, show that the whole legion had 451 men, but approximately 250 were dragoons". There would therefore appear to be no evidence for putting the total strength of the five British Legion light infantry companies at more than 200.&lt;ref name="babits" /&gt;}} It was commanded by [[Banastre Tarleton]] and gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies for "brutality and needless slaughter".&lt;ref name="rankin"&gt;[[#bass|Bass 1957]], pp. 548–550&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1779 the British Legion was one of five regiments that formed the [[American establishment (British army)|American Establishment]].&lt;ref name="w0lDK"&gt;[[#katcher|Katcher 1973]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

Women played various roles during the Revolutionary War; they often accompanied their husbands when permitted to do so. For example, throughout the war [[Martha Washington]] was known to visit and provide aid to her husband George at various American camps,&lt;ref name="NsXgO"&gt;[[#chernow2010|Chernow, 2010]], p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederika Charlotte Riedesel]] documented the [[Saratoga campaign]].&lt;ref name="BFMch"&gt;[[#berkin2005|Berkin 2005]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Women often accompanied armies as [[camp follower]]s to sell goods and perform necessary tasks in hospitals and camps. They were a necessary part of eighteenth-century armies, and numbered in the thousands during the war.&lt;ref name="s5toN"&gt;[[#dunkerly|Dunkerly 2014]], "Camp Followers"&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also assumed military roles: aside from auxiliary tasks like treating the wounded or setting up camp, some dressed as men to directly support combat, fight, or act as spies on both sides of the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name="HUZJR"&gt;[[#howat2017|Howat 2017]], "Women Spies"&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Maria Lane joined her husband in the Army and wore men's clothes by the time the [[Battle of Germantown]] happened. The Virginia General Assembly later cited her bravery: she fought while dressed as a man and "performed extraordinary military services, and received a severe wound at the battle of Germantown ... with the courage of a soldier".&lt;ref name="F5oSv"&gt;[[#womens2009|Historical Essay 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 1777, [[Sybil Ludington]] rode to alert militia forces of Putnam County, New York, and Danbury, Connecticut, to warn them of the British's approach; she has been called the "female Paul Revere".&lt;ref name="om7F0"&gt;[[#hunt2015|Hunt 2015]], pp. 188–222&lt;/ref&gt; A few others [[List of wartime cross-dressers|disguised themselves as men]].

When war began, the population of the Thirteen Colonies included an estimated 500,000 slaves, predominantly used as labor on [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|Southern plantations]].&lt;ref name="517PM"&gt;[[#nash2012|Nash 2012]], p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1775, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the Royal Governor of Virginia, issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] that promised freedom to any Patriot-owned slaves willing to bear arms. Although the announcement helped to fill a temporary manpower shortage, white Loyalist prejudice meant recruits were eventually redirected to non-combatant roles. The Loyalists' motive was to deprive Patriot [[Planter class|planters]] of labor rather than to end slavery; Loyalist-owned slaves were returned.&lt;ref name="CJ6XK"&gt;[[#nash2005|Nash, 2005]], pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1779 [[Philipsburg Proclamation]] issued by Clinton extended the offer of freedom to Patriot-owned slaves throughout the colonies. It persuaded entire families to escape to British lines, many of which were employed on farms to grow food for the army by removing the requirement for military service. While Clinton organized the [[Black Pioneers]], he also ensured fugitive slaves were returned to Loyalist owners with orders that they were not to be punished for their attempted escape.&lt;ref name="DKDsq"&gt;[[#blackcancol|Canada’ Digital Collections]] "Black Loyalists"&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, service as regular soldiers in British units became increasingly common; black Loyalists formed two regiments of the Charleston garrison in 1783.&lt;ref name="bfNHp"&gt;[[#bibko2016|Bibko, 2016]], pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ethiopian Regiment Liberty To Slaves Smock.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Copy of smock issued to [[Black Loyalist]]s in 1776]]

Estimates of the numbers who served the British during the war vary from 25,000 to 50,000, excluding those who escaped during wartime. Thomas Jefferson estimated that Virginia may have lost 30,000 slaves in total escapes.&lt;ref name="zag2G"&gt;[[#bibko2016|Bibko, 2016]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (about 30 percent of the enslaved population) either fled, migrated, or died, which significantly disrupted the plantation economies both during and after the war.&lt;ref name="yRG5O"&gt;[[#kolchin1994|Kolchin 1994]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black Patriot]]s were barred from the Continental Army until Washington convinced Congress in January 1778 that there was no other way to replace losses from disease and desertion. The [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]] formed in February included former slaves whose owners were compensated; however, only 140 of its 225 soldiers were black and recruitment stopped in June 1788.&lt;ref name="Ltvqf"&gt;[[#lanning2012|Lanning 2012]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, around 5,000 African-Americans served in the Continental Army and Navy in a variety of roles, while another 4,000 were employed in Patriot militia units, aboard privateers, or as teamsters, servants, and spies. After the war, a small minority received land grants or Congressional pensions in old age; many others were returned to their masters post-war despite earlier promises of freedom.&lt;ref name="aJJzP"&gt;[[#alexander2010|Alexander 2010]], p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Patriot victory became increasingly likely, the treatment of Black Loyalists became a point of contention; after the surrender of Yorktown in 1781, Washington insisted all escapees be returned but Cornwallis refused. In 1782 and 1783, around 8,000 to 10,000 freed blacks were evacuated by the British from Charleston, Savannah, and New York; some moved onto London, while 3,000 to 4,000 settled in [[Nova Scotia]], where they founded settlements such as [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]].&lt;ref name="Bvc5o"&gt;[[#bibko2016|Bibko, 2016]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; White Loyalists transported 15,000 enslaved blacks to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]]. The free Black Loyalists who migrated to the [[British West Indies]] included regular soldiers from Dunmore's [[Ethiopian Regiment]], and those from Charleston who helped garrison the [[Leeward Islands]].&lt;ref name="bfNHp" /&gt;

===American Indians===
{{Main|Category:Native Americans in the American Revolution}}
Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, and many tribes were divided over how to respond to the conflict. A few tribes were friendly with the colonists, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes who deployed around 1,500 men.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 393"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in July 1776, [[Cherokee]] allies of Britain attacked the short-lived [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] of [[North Carolina Colony|North Carolina]]. Their defeat splintered both Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]], who perpetuated the [[Cherokee–American wars]] against American settlers for decades after hostilities with Britain ended.&lt;ref name="finger2001"&gt;[[#finger2001|Finger 2001]], pp. 43–64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the [[Broad River (Georgia)|Broad River]] in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined [[Thomas Brown (loyalist)|Thomas Brown's]] raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the [[Siege of Savannah]].&lt;ref name="KPNF9"&gt;[[#wardH1999|Ward, H. 1999]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indians were involved in the fight between Britain and Spain on the Gulf Coast and along the British side of the Mississippi River. Thousands of Creeks, [[Chickasaw]]s, and [[Choctaw]]s fought in major battles such as the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]], the [[Battle of Mobile (1781)|Battle of Mobile]], and the [[Siege of Pensacola]].&lt;ref name="npQH7"&gt;[[#o'brien2008|O'Brien 2008]], pp. 123–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the American Revolutionary War, whatever side they took; the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] tribes sided with the British; members of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawks]] fought on both sides; and many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the Americans. To retaliate against raids on American settlement by Loyalists and their Indian allies, the Continental Army dispatched the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on a punitive expedition throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]] sided with the Americans and the British respectively, which further exacerbated the split.&lt;ref name="Q9pmz"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 200–203&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[western theater of the American Revolutionary War]], conflicts between settlers and Indians led to lingering distrust.&lt;ref name="y9yCm"&gt;[[#reidD2017|Reid, D. 2017]], p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], Great Britain ceded control of the disputed lands between the Great Lakes and the [[Ohio River]], but the Indian inhabitants were not a part of the peace negotiations.&lt;ref name="lsicb"&gt;[[#carroll2001|Carroll 2001]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Tribes in the [[Northwest Territory]] joined together as the [[Western Confederacy]] and allied with the British to resist American settlement, and their conflict continued after the Revolutionary War as the [[Northwest Indian War]].&lt;ref name="BnzRx"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]], Prime Minister since 1770, delegated control of the war in North America to [[Lord George Germain]] and the [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Earl of Sandwich]], who was [[First Lord of the Admiralty|head of the Royal Navy]] from 1771 to 1782. Defeat at Saratoga in 1777 made it clear the revolt would not be easily suppressed, especially after the Franco-American alliance of February 1778, and French declaration of war in June. With Spain also expected to join the conflict, the Royal Navy needed to prioritize either the war in America or in Europe; Germain advocated the former, Sandwich the latter.&lt;ref name="Zfq4g"&gt;[[#syrett1998|Syrett 1998]], pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt;

British negotiators now proposed a second peace settlement to Congress.&lt;ref name="P8wnQ"&gt;[[#hibbert2000|Hibbert 2000]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The terms presented by the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] included acceptance of the principle of self-government. Parliament would recognize Congress as the governing body, suspend any objectionable legislation, surrender its right to local colonial taxation, and discuss including American representatives in the House of Commons. In return, all property confiscated from Loyalists would be returned, British debts honored, and locally enforced martial law accepted. However, Congress demanded either immediate recognition of independence or the withdrawal of all British troops; they knew the commission were not authorized to accept these, bringing negotiations to a rapid end.&lt;ref name="EVGwD"&gt;[[#whiteley1996|Whiteley 1996]], p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

When the commissioners returned to London in November 1778, they recommended a change in policy. Sir Henry Clinton, the new British Commander-in-Chief in America, was ordered to stop treating the rebels as enemies, rather than subjects whose loyalty might be regained.&lt;ref name="hibbert161"&gt;[[#hibbert2000|Hibbert 2000]], pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt; Those standing orders would be in effect for three years until Clinton was relieved.&lt;ref name="1s4gQ"&gt;[[#jgreene2008|Greene &amp; Pole 2008]], p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

North backed the Southern strategy hoping to exploit divisions between the mercantile north and slave-owning south, but after Yorktown accepted this policy had failed.&lt;ref name="6mBg1"&gt;[[#hibbert|Hibbert 2008]], p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear the war was lost, although the Royal Navy forced the French to relocate their fleet to the Caribbean in November 1781 and resumed a close blockade of American trade.&lt;ref name="EiC1K"&gt;[[#davisengerman2006|Davis, L. and Engerman 2006]], p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting economic damage and rising inflation meant the US was now eager to end the war, while France was unable to provide further loans; Congress could no longer pay its soldiers.&lt;ref name="q5EIL"&gt;[[#Rappleye2010|Rappleye 2010]], pp. 300–313&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 1782, a Whig motion to end the offensive war in America was carried by 19 votes.&lt;ref name="PpAUy"&gt;[[#namier1985|Namier and Brooke 1985]], p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; North now resigned, obliging the king to invite [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] to form a government; a consistent supporter of the Patriot cause, he made a commitment to US independence a condition of doing so. George III reluctantly accepted and the [[Second Rockingham ministry|new government]] took office on March 27, 1782; however, Rockingham died unexpectedly on July 1, and was replaced by [[Shelburne ministry|Lord Shelburne]] who acknowledged American independence.&lt;ref name="6fSnW"&gt;[[#wardA1925|Ward and Prothero 1925]], p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lord Rockingham, the Whig leader and friend of the American cause was elevated to Prime Minister, Congress consolidated its diplomatic consuls in Europe into a peace delegation at Paris. All were experienced in Congressional leadership. The dean of the delegation was [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania. He had become a celebrity in the French Court, but he was also an Enlightenment scientist with influence in the courts of European great powers in Prussia, England's former ally, and Austria, a Catholic empire like Spain. Since the 1760s he had been an organizer of British American inter-colony cooperation, and then a colonial lobbyist to Parliament in London. [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts had been consul to the Dutch Republic and was a prominent early New England Patriot. [[John Jay]] of New York had been consul to Spain and was a past president of the Continental Congress. As consul to the Dutch Republic, [[Henry Laurens]] of South Carolina had secured a preliminary agreement for a trade agreement. He had been a successor to John Jay as [[President of the Continental Congress|president of Congress]] and with Franklin was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. Although active in the preliminaries, he was not a signer of the conclusive treaty.&lt;ref name="OtLkf" /&gt;

The Whig negotiators for Lord Rockingham and his successor, Prime Minister Lord Shelburne, included long-time friend of Benjamin Franklin from his time in London, [[David Hartley (the Younger)|David Hartley]] and [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]], who had negotiated Laurens' release from the Tower of London.&lt;ref name="OtLkf" /&gt; The Preliminary Peace signed on November 30 met four key Congressional demands: independence, territory up to the Mississippi, navigation rights into the Gulf of Mexico, and fishing rights in Newfoundland.&lt;ref name="OtLkf" /&gt;

British strategy was to strengthen the US sufficiently to prevent France from regaining a foothold in North America, and they had little interest in these proposals.&lt;ref name="6HMUl"&gt;[[#Black2011|Black 2011]], pp. 117–18&lt;/ref&gt; However, divisions between their opponents allowed them to negotiate separately with each to improve their overall position, starting with the American delegation in September 1782.&lt;ref name="s8bf9"&gt;[[#Harvey2004|Harvey 2004]], pp. 531–32&lt;/ref&gt; The French and Spanish sought to improve their position by creating the U.S. dependent on them for support against Britain, thus reversing the losses of 1763.&lt;ref name="0XLAe"&gt;[[#cogliano2003|Cogliano 2003]], p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties tried to negotiate a settlement with Britain excluding the Americans; France proposed setting the western boundary of the US along the Appalachians, matching the British [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|1763 Proclamation Line]]. The Spanish suggested additional concessions in the vital Mississippi River Basin, but required the cession of [[Georgia in the American Revolution|Georgia]] in violation of the Franco-American alliance.&lt;ref name="0XLAe" /&gt;

Facing difficulties with Spain over claims involving the Mississippi River, and from France who was still reluctant to agree to American independence until all her demands were met, John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain, and Prime Minister Lord Shelburne, in charge of the British negotiations, agreed.&lt;ref name="iRKom"&gt;[[#morris1965|Morris, 1983]]&amp;nbsp;[1965], pp. 221–323, 331–333&lt;/ref&gt; Key agreements for America in obtaining peace included recognition of United States independence, that she would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada; the granting of fishing rights in the [[Grand Banks]], off the coast of [[Newfoundland]] and in the Gulf of [[Saint Lawrence]]; the United States and Great Britain were to each be given perpetual access to the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name="XAtfM"&gt;[[#dull1975|Dull 1987]]&amp;nbsp;[1975], pp. 144–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dKEt7"&gt;[[#morris1965|Morris, 1983]]&amp;nbsp;[1965], pp. 218–221&lt;/ref&gt;

An Anglo-American Preliminary Peace was formally entered into in November 1782, and Congress endorsed the settlement on April 15, 1783. It announced the achievement of peace with independence; the "conclusive" treaty was signed on September 2, 1783, in Paris, effective the next day September 3, when Britain signed its treaty with France. John Adams, who helped draft the treaty, claimed it represented "one of the most important political events that ever happened on the globe". Ratified respectively by Congress and Parliament, the final versions were exchanged in Paris the following spring.&lt;ref name="9BwsN"&gt;[[#lskaplan1983|Kaplan, L. 1983]], "Treaty of Paris"&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November, the last British troops remaining in the US were evacuated from New York to Halifax.&lt;ref name="Nuhdu"&gt;[[#ketchum2014b|Ketchum 2014b]], p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington expressed astonishment that the Americans had won a war against a leading world power, referring to the American victory as "little short of a standing miracle".&lt;ref name="Ze79i"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between British subjects with the Crown against those with the Congress had lasted over eight years from 1775 to 1783. The last uniformed British troops [[Evacuation Day (New York)|departed]] their last east coast port cities in Savannah, Charleston, and New York City, by November 25, 1783. That marked the end of British occupation in the new United States.&lt;ref name="Bh0N4"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 557–558&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 1783, Washington issued orders that he had long waited to give, that "all acts of hostility" were to cease immediately. That same day, by arrangement with Washington, [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|General Carleton]] issued a similar order to British troops. British troops, however, were not to evacuate until a prisoner of war exchange occurred, an effort that involved much negotiation and would take some seven months to effect.&lt;ref name="zaInj"&gt;[[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], p. 553&lt;/ref&gt;

As directed by a Congressional resolution of May 26, 1783, all non-commissioned officers and enlisted were furloughed "to their homes" until the "definitive treaty of peace", when they would be automatically discharged. The US armies were directly disbanded in the field as of Washington's General Orders on Monday, June 2, 1783.&lt;ref name="clMCt"&gt;[[#armour1941|Armour 1941]], p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; Once the conclusive Treaty of Paris was signed with Britain, Washington resigned as commander-in-chief at Congress, leaving for his Army retirement at Mount Vernon.&lt;ref name="OtLkf" /&gt;

The expanse of territory that was now the United States was ceded from its colonial [[Homeland#Motherland|Mother country]] alone. It included millions of sparsely settled acres south of the [[Great Lakes|Great Lakes Line]] between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. The tentative colonial migration west became a flood during the years of the Revolutionary War. Virginia's Kentucky County counted 150 men in 1775. By 1790 fifteen years later, it numbered over 73,000 and was seeking statehood in the United States.&lt;ref name="0xR4w"&gt;[[#herring2011|Herring 2011]]&amp;nbsp;[2008], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's extended post-war policy for the US continued to try to establish an Indian buffer state below the Great Lakes as late as 1814 during the [[War of 1812]]. The formally acquired western American lands continued to be populated by a dozen or so American Indian tribes that had been British allies for the most part.&lt;ref name="lsicb" /&gt; Though British forts on their lands had been ceded to either the French or the British prior to the creation of the United States,&lt;ref name="KK3Lj"&gt;[[#USCon1795|Treaty of Greenville 1795]], U.S. Congress and "Tribes Northwest of the Ohio River"&lt;/ref&gt; Indians were not referred to in the British cession to the US. While tribes were not consulted by the British for the treaty, in practice the British refused to abandon the forts on territory they formally transferred. Instead, they provisioned military allies for continuing frontier raids and sponsored the [[Northwest Indian War|Northwest Indian War (1785–1795)]]. British sponsorship of local warfare on the United States continued until the Anglo-American [[Jay Treaty]] went into effect.&lt;ref name="CrkMd"&gt;Benn 1993, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|For the thirteen years prior to the Anglo-American commercial [[Jay Treaty]] of 1796 under President [[John Adams]], the British maintained five forts in New York state: two forts at northern Lake Champlain, and three beginning at [[Fort Niagara]] stretching east along Lake Ontario. In the Northwest Territory, they garrisoned [[Fort Detroit]] and [[Fort Michilimackinac]].&lt;ref name="1S547"&gt;[[#herring2011|Herring 2011]]&amp;nbsp;[2008], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}} At the same time, the Spanish also sponsored war within the US by Indian proxies in its Southwest Territory ceded by France to Britain, then Britain to the Americans.&lt;ref name="0xR4w" /&gt;

Of the European powers with American colonies adjacent to the newly created United States, Spain was most threatened by American independence, and it was correspondingly the most hostile to it.{{Efn|There had been native-born Spanish (hidalgo) uprisings in several American colonies during the American revolution, contesting mercantilist reforms of Carlos III that had removed privileges inherited from the Conquistadors among [[encomienda]]s, and they also challenged Jesuit dominance in the Catholic Church there. American ship captains were known to have smuggled banned copies of the Declaration of Independence into Spanish Caribbean ports, provoking Spanish colonial discontent.}} Its territory adjacent to the US was relatively undefended, so Spanish policy developed a combination of initiatives. Spanish soft power diplomatically challenged the British territorial cession west to the Mississippi and the previous northern boundaries of [[Spanish Florida]].&lt;ref name="ImmKb"&gt;[[#herring2011|Herring 2011]]&amp;nbsp;[2008], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; It imposed a high tariff on American goods, then blocked American settler access to the port of New Orleans. Spanish hard power extended war alliances and arms to Southwestern Indians to resist American settlement. A former Continental Army General, [[James Wilkinson]] settled in [[History of Kentucky#Kentucky in the American Revolution (1775–1783)|Kentucky County]] Virginia in 1784, and there he fostered settler secession from Virginia during the Spanish-allied [[Cherokee–American wars|Chickamauga Cherokee war]]. Beginning in 1787, he received pay as Spanish Agent 13, and subsequently expanded his efforts to persuade American settlers west of the Appalachians to secede from the United States, first in the Washington administration, and later again in the Jefferson administration.&lt;ref name="ImmKb" /&gt;

===Casualties and losses===

The total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown. As was typical in wars of the era, diseases such as [[smallpox]] claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a [[1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic]] broke out throughout North America, killing an estimated 130,000 among all its populations during those years.&lt;ref name="3kb8Q" /&gt;{{Efn|In addition to as many as 30% deaths in port cities, and especially high rates among the closely confined prisoner-of-war ships, scholars have reported large numbers lost among the Mexican population, and large percentage losses among the American Indian along trade routes, Atlantic to Pacific, Eskimo to Aztec.}} Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[Variolation|inoculated]] against the disease was one of his most important decisions.&lt;ref name="VcQK9"&gt;[[#ellis2004|Ellis 2004]], p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 70,000 American Patriots died during active military service.&lt;ref name="gNorb"&gt;[[#peckham74|Peckham 1974]], p.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, approximately 6,800 were killed in battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while [[prisoners of war]] of the British, mostly in the [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|prison ships]] in New York Harbor.&lt;ref name="hQzBc"&gt;[[#burrows2008b|Burrows 2008b]], p.{{Page needed|date=May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, it would make the conflict proportionally deadlier than the [[American Civil War]]. Uncertainty arises from the difficulties in accurately calculating the number of those who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone.&lt;ref name="RqnkF" /&gt;}} The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.&lt;ref name="Xwtjh"&gt;[[#chambers1999|Chambers 1999]] p. 849&lt;/ref&gt;

The French suffered 2,112 killed in combat in the United States.&lt;ref name="TO8lQ"&gt;[[#rignault2004|Dawson 2017]], "Frenchmen who died"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Elsewhere around the world, the French lost another approximately 5,000 total dead in conflicts 1778–1784.&lt;ref name="TO8lQ" /&gt;}} The Spanish lost a total of 124 killed and 247 wounded in West Florida.&lt;ref name="White 2010, Essay"&gt;[[#white2020|White 2010]], "Essay"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|During the same time period in the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], the Dutch suffered around 500 total killed, owing to the minor scale of their conflict with Britain.&lt;ref name="White 2010, Essay" /&gt;}}

A British report in 1781 puts their total Army deaths at 6,046 in North America (1775–1779).&lt;ref name="3kb8Q" /&gt;{{Efn|British returns in 1783 listed 43,633 rank and file deaths across the [[British Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="VdGXi"&gt;[[#Burke1785|Burke 1785]], p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first three years of the Anglo-French War (1778), British list 9,372 soldiers killed in battle across the Americas; and 3,326 in the West Indies (1778–1780).&lt;ref name="3kb8Q" /&gt; In 1784, a British lieutenant compiled a detailed list of 205 British officers killed in action during British conflicts outside of North America, encompassing Europe, the Caribbean and the East Indies.&lt;ref name="g1sff"&gt;[[#inman|Inman 1903]], pp. 203–205&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolations based upon this list puts British Army losses in the area of at least 4,000 killed or died of wounds outside of its North American engagements.&lt;ref name="RqnkF" /&gt;}} Approximately 7,774 [[Germans in the American Revolution#Auxiliaries hired by Britain|Germans]] died in British service in addition to 4,888 deserters; of the former, it is estimated 1,800 were killed in combat.&lt;ref name="RqnkF" /&gt;{{Efn|Around 171,000 [[sailors]] served in the [[Royal Navy]] during British conflicts worldwide 1775–1784; approximately a quarter of whom had been [[impressment|pressed]] into service.

===Legacy===

The American Revolution established the United States with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments. The United States has the world's oldest written constitution, and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the US Constitution, often word-for-word in places. It inspired the French, Haitian, Latin American Revolutions, and others into the modern era.&lt;ref name="Xqvd2"&gt;[[#bailyn2007|Bailyn, 2007]], pp. 35, 134–49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United States one dollar bill, reverse.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|U.S. motto ''Novus Ordo Seclorum'', "A New Age Now Begins"&lt;ref name="McDonald, Forrest pp. 6"&gt;McDonald, Forrest. ''Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution,'' pp. 6–7, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7006-0284-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The U.S. motto "A New Age Now Begins" is a paraphrase from [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet [[Common Sense]], "We have it in our power to begin the world over again."&lt;ref name="McDonald, Forrest pp. 6" /&gt;}}]]

Although the Revolution eliminated many forms of inequality, it did little to change the status of women, despite the role they played in winning independence. Most significantly, it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in [[American Civil War|civil war]]. While many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some, yet denying it to others, the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition too great a challenge. Between 1774 and 1780, many of the states banned the importation of slaves, but the institution itself continued.&lt;ref name="0skc6"&gt;[[#morgan2012|Morgan, 2012]]&amp;nbsp;[1956], pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, Virginia passed a law permitting manumission and over the next eight years more than 10,000 slaves were given their freedom.&lt;ref name="DggJY"&gt;[[#morgan2012|Morgan, 2012]]&amp;nbsp;[1956], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; With support from Benjamin Franklin, in 1790 the [[Quakers]] petitioned Congress to abolish slavery;&lt;ref name="7lwwd"&gt;[[#middlekauff1982|Middlekauff, 2007]]&amp;nbsp;[1982], p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; the number of abolitionist movements greatly increased, and by 1804 all the northern states had outlawed it.&lt;ref name="wneY7"&gt;[[#wood1992|Wood, 1992]], pp. 3–8, 186–7&lt;/ref&gt; However, even many like Adams who viewed slavery as a 'foul contagion' opposed the 1790 petition as a threat to the Union.&lt;ref name="OmK4W"&gt;[[#wood2017|Wood, 2017]], p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808, Jefferson passed legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|banning the importation of slaves]], but allowed the domestic slave trade to continue, arguing the federal government had no right to regulate individual states.&lt;ref name="7YOzX"&gt;[[#wood2017|Wood, 2017]], p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
A large historiography concerns the reasons the Americans revolted and successfully broke away.&lt;ref name="g6SJo"&gt;Paul David Nelson, "British Conduct of the American Revolutionary War: A Review of Interpretations." ''Journal of American History'' 65.3 (1978): 623-653. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1901416 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Patriots", an insulting term used by the British that was proudly adopted by the Americans, stressed the constitutional rights of Englishmen, especially "[[No taxation without representation]]." Historians since the 1960s have emphasized that the Patriot constitutional argument was made possible by the emergence of a sense of American nationalism that united all 13 colonies. In turn, that nationalism was rooted in a [[republicanism in the United States|Republican value system]] that demanded consent of the governed and opposed aristocratic control.&lt;ref name="fcrPt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tyrrell | first1 = Ian | year = 1999 | title = Making Nations/Making States: American Historians in the Context of Empire | journal = Journal of American History | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 1015–1044 | jstor=2568604| doi = 10.2307/2568604}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain itself, republicanism was a fringe view since it challenged the aristocratic control of the British political system. Political power was not controlled by an aristocracy or nobility in the 13 colonies, and instead, the colonial political system was based on the winners of free elections, which were open to the majority of white men. In the analysis of the coming of the Revolution, historians in recent decades have mostly used one of three approaches.&lt;ref name="ZBA7A"&gt;Robin Winks, ed. ''Historiography'' (1999) 5:95&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atlantic history]] view places the American story in a broader context, including revolutions in France and Haiti. It tends to reintegrate the historiographies of the American Revolution and the British Empire.&lt;ref name="ZJ2KF"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cogliano | first1 = Francis D. | year = 2010 | title = Revisiting the American Revolution | journal = History Compass | volume = 8 | issue = 8| pages = 951–963 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2010.00705.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWA5Z"&gt;Eliga H.

The "[[new social history]]" approach looks at community social structure to find cleavages that were magnified into colonial cleavages.

The ideological approach that centers on republicanism in the United States.&lt;ref name="Uo7j4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Kennedy|author2=Lizabeth Cohen|title=American Pageant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ6aBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156|year=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=156|isbn=9781305537422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republicanism dictated there would be no royalty, aristocracy or national church but allowed for continuation of the British common law, which American lawyers and jurists understood and approved and used in their everyday practice. Historians have examined how the rising American legal profession adopted British common law to incorporate republicanism by selective revision of legal customs and by introducing more choices for courts.&lt;ref name="dd44y"&gt;Ellen Holmes Pearson. "Revising Custom, Embracing Choice: Early American Legal Scholars and the Republicanization of the Common Law", in Gould and Onuf, eds. ''Empire and Nation: The American Revolution in the Atlantic World'' (2005) pp. 93–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5N3hK"&gt;[[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], ''Rise of the Legal Profession in America'' (1965) vol 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemorations of the Revolutionary War==
After the first U.S. postage stamp was issued in 1849 the U.S. Post Office frequently issued commemorative stamps celebrating the various people and events of the Revolutionary War. However, it would be more than 140 years after the Revolution before any stamp commemorating that war was ever issued. The first such stamp was the 'Liberty Bell' issue of 1926.&lt;ref name="ULvJk"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Houseman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhB5tAEACAAJ |title=Scott 2019 Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers |last2=Kloetzel |publisher=Amos Media Company |year=2019 |isbn=9780894875595 |quote=Stamps listed in chronological order}}&lt;/ref&gt;
