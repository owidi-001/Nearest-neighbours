== History ==
[[File:Trinity University Banner.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Trinity University Banner]]
[[Cumberland Presbyterian Church|Cumberland Presbyterian]]s founded Trinity in 1869 in [[Tehuacana, Texas]],  from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that had lost significant enrollment during the [[Texas in the Civil War|Civil War]]. [[John Boyd (Texas Congressman)|John Boyd]], who had served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] from 1836 to 1845 and in the [[Texas Senate]] from 1862 to 1863, donated 1,100 acres of land and financial assistance to establish the new university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Cecil, Jr. |last=Harper |title=BOYD, JOHN |encyclopedia=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbo59 |date=2010-06-12 |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |access-date=2014-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elizabeth LeNoir |last=Jennett |title=Biographical Directory of the Texan Conventions and Congresses, 1832-1845 |date=1942 |pages=54–55 |url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/members/bios/Bio_Directory_Texas_Convs_Congresses_1832-1845.pdf#page=49 |access-date=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trinity University San Antonio 7-73.jpg|250px|thumb|Trinity University in [[San Antonio]]]]
[[File:Second Trinity University Campus 1.JPG|250px|thumb|Former Trinity University campus in [[Waxahachie, Texas]]]]
Believing that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to [[Waxahachie, Texas]]. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church]]. The [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university's viability.

Meanwhile, in 1942, the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist]]-affiliated [[University of San Antonio]] was failing. San Antonio community leaders, who wished to maintain a [[Protestant]]-affiliated college in the city, approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University]]). For the next decade, the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near-west side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military [[barracks]] and [[quonset hut]]s to house students and to provide library and classroom space.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/trinity-history |title=Trinity University History |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Trinity acquired a former [[limestone]] [[quarry]] for a new campus and hired Texas [[architect]] [[O'Neil Ford]] to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.

When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Yet, under the leadership of Dr. James W. Laurie, the university's 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature.  Dr. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity's endowment, largely funded by the [[James A. Chapman|James A. and Leta M. Chapman]] Charitable Trust of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Donald E. |last=Everett |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbt32| title=TRINITY UNIVERSITY |encyclopedia=The Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association |date=2010-06-15 |access-date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogersandbell.com/Trusts.aspx |title=Chapman Charitable Trusts - Preserving the Legacy of the Chapman Trusts |website=Rogers and Bell |access-date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus on its “University on the Hill” location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio. In 1969, Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent university with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a "historically connected" member of the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]].

Trinity's growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie's successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under Dr. Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master's programs offered from more than 20 to four. Also, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617073736/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 June 2012|title=Trinity University stakes its future on recruiting intelligence 04/05/1987 - Archives - Chron.com - Houston Chronicle|date=17 June 2012|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgaard's successor, [[John R. Brazil]], focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The "Campaign for Trinity University", which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US$200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the campaign raised $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |date=2009-09-25 |title=Trinity University’s Capital Campaign Totals $205.9 Million |publisher=Trinity University |access-date=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222024740/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |archive-date=February 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Brazil served as Trinity's president through January 2010. Upon announcement of his retirement, the board of trustees awarded him its Distinguished Service Award, Trinity's most prestigious honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090123brazilretire.htm |title=Trinity University President Announces Retirement in 2010 |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-01-23 |access-date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dennis A. Ahlburg]] served as president from January 2010 to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090925_ahlburg.htm |title=Trinity University Selects 18th President |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-09-25 |access-date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Ahlburg's presidency, Trinity developed and executed a strategic plan to shape the future of the university. Academically, Trinity refined its curriculum to further define a liberal arts education, developed an entrepreneurship program, and realigned the business program.  Trinity also refocused its marketing to raise the university's national profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 | title=University President to Step Down in 2015 | publisher=Trinity University | date=2014-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, under Ahlburg, Trinity built the Center for Sciences and Innovation, which modernized and combined science facilities to ease collaboration across disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 |title=University President to Step Down in 2015|publisher=Trinity University |date=May 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danny J. Anderson, a Latin American literature scholar and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the [[University of Kansas]], succeeded Ahlburg as president in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/trinity-university-selects-19th-president |title=Trinity University Selects 19th President |publisher=Trinity University |date=2014-12-15 |access-date=2015-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President Michael Fischer served as the interim president.

=== Strategic plan ===
In 2011, Trinity undertook the development of a comprehensive 10-year strategic plan, ''Trinity Tomorrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://strategicplan.trinity.edu/|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Tomorrow |access-date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the long-term sustainability of the university. The board of trustees approved the plan in May 2013, which details four strategic objectives:
*Strengthen opportunities for experiential learning
*Foster productive collisions as a defining characteristic
*Enhance students international engagement and awareness
*Maximize the educational and personal benefits of a residential liberal arts university

and four foundations to achieve them:
*Strengthen market position and improve student recruitment
*Be an innovative leader for excellence in teaching and research
*Improve alumni relations, engagement, and giving
*Build the infrastructure to support a 21st-century university

Administrators have begun enacting the details of the plan with positive outcomes. Among other highlights, Trinity:
*adopted a new curriculum
*increased its marketing locally and nationally 
*launched centers to focus on college success, experiential learning and career preparedness, and international citizenship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/news/trinity-launches-three-strategic-centers|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Launches Three Strategic Centers |access-date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
*launched the Tiger Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/live|website=Trinity University |title=Tiger Network |access-date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase access to campus events via the Internet

=== Academics ===
Trinity offers 47 majors and 59 minors in the traditional [[liberal arts]], business, [[Natural science|sciences]], [[fine arts]], and [[engineering]], and graduate programs in [[accounting]], [[teaching]], [[school psychology]], [[Academic administration|school administration]], and [[health care|health care administration]]&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/fast-facts |title=Fast Facts |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only university in San Antonio to offer a minor in [[creative writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/academics/majors-minors/creative-writing|website=Trinity University|title=Creative Writing|access-date=15 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity stresses close interaction between students and faculty members across all disciplines, with a 9:1 student/faculty ratio. The full-time faculty numbers 228, 98% of whom hold a [[Ph.D]]. or other terminal degree in their field.  About 47% of the student body has studied abroad in over 35 countries.

All undergraduates must demonstrate proficiency across a broad range of academic disciplines, regardless of major. At its core, the Common Curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inside.trinity.edu/student-success/advising/common-curriculum |website=Inside Trinity |title=Common Curriculum |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the liberal arts foundation for all undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity. The Common Curriculum consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x28972.xml |title=Courses of Study 2013-14 |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First-Year Experience (FYE) Program'''''
Starting in fall 2015, all first-year students must complete a 6-credit hour course in their first semester that meets five days a week. The FYE consists of a writing workshop, discussion seminar, and a common day where everyone from the different sections meet for guest speakers, student conferences, or library sessions to assist students in the research process.

'''''Foreign Language, Computer, and Mathematics Skills'''''
*Foreign Languages 
Trinity students must reach a minimum level of competence corresponding to that attained after successful completion of the first semester of the second year of college foreign language study. An international baccalaureate course at higher level with a 6 or 7 or an AP language test score of 3 or higher will suffice in most cases.  
*Computer Skills
Students must be able to use computers to collect, organize, analyze and communicate information in an academic environment. Students who do not pass a test demonstrating these competencies must fulfill this requirement by completing an approved course built around these criteria.
*Mathematics 
Trinity requires completion of three years of high school mathematics, including either trigonometry or precalculus, for admission as a first-year student. While there is no further requirement, all students are urged to undertake further study of mathematics at Trinity.

40 percent of students attend graduate school immediately after earning their bachelor's, and 65 percent of all students attend within five years of graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121033620/http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf |date=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the Office of Institutional Research indicated that Trinity has made considerable progress in the number of graduates going on to earn doctoral degrees. Of students earning a bachelor's between 1982 and 1986, 2.9% went on to earn doctorates; of those earning a bachelor's between 1997 and 2001, 8.5% had. Trinity improved its ranking in this category from 328th to 38th among other colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x402.xml |website=Trinity University |title=Office of Institutional Research |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek life ===

Trinity hosts fourteen Greek organizations, seven fraternities and seven sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inside.trinity.edu/get-involved/fraternity-sorority-life |website=Trinity University |title=Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life |access-date=August 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' estimates that 14% of men and 19% of women were members, or about 17% of total undergraduate enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/trinity-university-3647 |title=Trinity University |website=U.S. News College Compass |publisher=U.S. News and World Report |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current fraternities and sororities are as follows:

'''Fraternities:'''

* Triniteers

'''Sororities:'''
* Alpha Chi Lambda
* Chi Beta Epsilon
* Gamma Chi Delta
* Phi Delta Kappa

* Zeta Chi

On occasion, fraternities and sororities have been mired in conflict at Trinity. In 1991, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Trinity had discontinued campus Greek organizations right to pledge new members as a result of being in violation of the university's alcohol use policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Campus Life: Trinity; Fraternity Charter Is Taken Away In Drinking Case |date=1991-03-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/03/nyregion/campus-life-trinity-fraternity-charter-is-taken-away-in-drinking-case.html |access-date=2012-07-17 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, two fraternities and two sororities had their charters temporarily revoked for hazing violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Aly |last=Mithani |url=http://www.trinitonian.com/2012/04/27/panel-stands-tough/ |title=Panel stands tough |newspaper=Trinitonian |date=2012-04-27 |access-date=2014-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501075308/http://www.trinitonian.com/2012/04/27/panel-stands-tough/ |archive-date=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; These violations were said to have taken place over many years.&lt;ref name="trinitonian.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Puckett |url=http://www.trinitonian.com/2012/04/13/greek-saga-continues/ |title=Greek saga continues |newspaper=Trinitonian |date=2012-04-13 |access-date=2014-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416175704/http://www.trinitonian.com/2012/04/13/greek-saga-continues/ |archive-date=2012-04-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lloyd |first=Jennifer R. |title=Trinity suspends frats for hazing, behavior |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/education/article/Trinity-suspends-frats-for-hazing-behavior-3456169.php |work=San Antonio Express-News |date=2012-04-03 |access-date=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Trinity Tigers}}
[[File:Trinity university football lettermen 1915.jpg|right|thumb|Men's football team, 1915]]The '''Trinity Tigers''' is [[List of U.S. college team nicknames|the nickname for]] the sports teams of Trinity University. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and the [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCAC).&lt;ref name="athletics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/index.htm |title=Athletics |work=Trinity.edu |publisher=Trinity University |access-date=2007-10-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029001416/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/index.htm |archive-date=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school mascot is LeeRoy, a [[Bengal tiger]].  In the 1950s, LeeRoy was an actual tiger who was brought to sporting events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://trinity.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p3005coll2&amp;CISOPTR=126&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=12 | title=Lee Roy the  Tiger | work=Trinity Digital Collection | publisher=Trinity University | access-date=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today LeeRoy is portrayed by a student wearing a tiger suit.

Trinity fields strong teams, evidenced by its finishes in the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] (NACDA) Learfield Directors' Cup, which recognizes the strength of athletic programs by division. Since the Directors' Cup inception in 1995, Trinity has finished in the top 10 on five occasions out of over 400 [[NCAA Division III|Division Ill]] programs; it finished 31st in 2017-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2017-18/misc_non_event/May31overallDIII_final.pdf |title=Directors' Cup Division III Final Standings|website=NACDA |date=2018-05-31 |access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity has historically had a strong [[tennis]] program. In 1963, Al G. Hill, Jr, grandson of oilman H L Hunt, entered as a Freshman Tennis Player.  When he graduated in 1967 as Tiger Captain, the College Tennis Courts were named after him. Under the tutelage of Coach Clarence Mabry, Trinity Player [[Chuck McKinley]] won the Wimbledon Singles Championship in 1963 and was rated the #1 men's Singles Player in the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time Magazine |title=One for the Yanks |date=1963-07-12 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940309,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222074713/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940309,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |access-date=2015-06-13 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; With partner [[Dennis Ralston]], McKinley won the US Men's Doubles Championship in 1961, 1963, and 1964. McKinley and Ralston also played all of the matches while winning the Davis Cup for the US in 1963.  All of these accomplishments occurred while McKinley was a Trinity undergraduate.

In 1970, as a freshman at Trinity, [[Brian Gottfried]] won the [[United States Tennis Association|USTA]] boys 18s Singles Championship, as well as the Doubles Championship with [[Sandy Mayer|Alexander Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ustaboys.com/tournament/past_winners.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100637/http://ustaboys.com/tournament/past_winners.php|archive-date=2007-09-29|access-date=24 April 2014|title=USTA Boys 18 &amp; 16: Past Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 Trinity won the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Hall_of_Fame/stockton.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205070944/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Hall_of_Fame/stockton.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger Captain that year, [[Dick Stockton]], won the NCAA Men's Singles Championship.

As a result, the SCAC will no longer offer football as a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitytigers.com/sports/fball/2015-16/releases/151118_fball_saa_affiliate|title=Trinity to Join SAA as Affiliate Member in Football|date=18 November 2015|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the Trinity Baseball Team won the Division III College World Series in a best-of-three format, beating [[Keystone College]] 14-6 in game 1 and 10-7 in game 2.
