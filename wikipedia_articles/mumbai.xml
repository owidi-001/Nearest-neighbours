== Etymology ==

A resident of Mumbai is called ''Mumbaikar'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], in which the suffix ''kar'' means a ''resident of''. The term had been in use for quite some time but it gained popularity after the official name change to Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Mumbaikar" /&gt; Older terms such as ''Bombayite'' are also in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Vir Sanghvi |title=The Angry Bombay-ite |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/the-angry-bombay-ite/story-0bQZZ6gJQxGeVyotqUVGIO.html |access-date=15 April 2019 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=2 April 2006|author-link=Vir Sanghvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3 Mumbaikars Who Are Changing The City All By Themselves |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/the-better-india/3-mumbaikars-who-are-changing-the-city-all-by-themselves_a_21477899/ |website=[[HuffPost]] |access-date=15 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of [[seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]]: [[Isle of Bombay]], [[Parel]], [[Mazagaon]], [[Mahim]], [[Colaba]], [[Worli]], and [[Old Woman's Island]] (also known as ''Little Colaba'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farooqui|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited.

[[File:Hajiali.jpg|thumb|The [[Haji Ali Dargah]] was built in 1431, when Mumbai was under the rule of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]].]]
[[Bhima of Mahikavati|King Bhimdev]] founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in ''Mahikawati'' (present day [[Mahim]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dwivedi|Mehrotra|2001|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pathare Prabhu]]s, among the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to ''Mahikawati'' from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev.&lt;ref name="prabhu"&gt;{{harvnb|Maharashtra|2004|p=1703|Ref=prabhu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Delhi Sultanate]] annexed the islands in 1347–48 and controlled it until 1407.

The islands were later governed by the independent [[Gujarat Sultanate]], which was established in 1407.

According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of [[Vasai|Bassein]] and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese.

From 1782 onwards, the city was reshaped with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the [[seven islands of Bombay]] into a single amalgamated mass by way of a [[causeway]] called the [[Hornby Vellard]], which was completed by 1784.&lt;ref name="Dwivedi 2001 28" /&gt; In 1817, the British East India Company under [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] defeated [[Baji Rao II]], the last of the Maratha ''Peshwa'' in the [[Battle of Khadki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naravane|2007|pp=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his defeat, almost the whole of the [[Deccan Plateau]] came under British suzerainty, and was incorporated into the Bombay Presidency.

After India's independence in 1947, the territory of the [[Bombay Presidency]] retained by India was restructured into [[Bombay State]]. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state. Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Census of India|1961|p=23|Ref=cent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1950, Municipal limits of Bombay were expanded by merging the [[Mumbai suburban district|Bombay Suburban District]] and [[Mumbai city district|Bombay City]] to form the Greater Bombay Municipal Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbaisuburban.gov.in/html/administrative_setup.htm|title=Administration|access-date=6 November 2008|publisher=[[Mumbai Suburban District]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121000427/http://mumbaisuburban.gov.in/html/administrative_setup.htm|archive-date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samyukta Maharashtra movement]] to create a separate Maharashtra state including Bombay was at its height in the 1950s. In the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'' discussions in 1955, the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 1960s saw the rise of regionalist politics in Bombay, with the formation of the [[Shiv Sena]] on 19 June 1966, under the leadership of [[Bal Thackeray|Balasaheb Thackeray]] out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalisation of the native [[Marathi people]] in Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gogate|first1=Sudha|title=The Emergence of Regionalism in Mumbai|year=2014|publisher=Popular Prakashan Pvt.

Mumbai suffers from the same major urbanisation problems seen in many fast growing cities in [[developing countries]]: widespread poverty and unemployment, poor public health and poor civic and educational standards for a large section of the population. With available land at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. Many of them live in close proximity to bus or train stations although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Datta|Jones|1999|loc=Low-Income Households and the Housing Problem in Mumbai, pp. 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharavi]], Asia's second largest [[slum]] (if [[Karachi]]'s [[Orangi|Orangi Town]] is counted as a single slum)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Marc|title=Dharavi: Mumbai's Shadow City|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/dharavi-mumbai-slum/jacobson-text|website=[[National Geographic Magazine]]|date=May 2007|access-date=28 April 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318083827/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/dharavi-mumbai-slum/jacobson-text|archive-date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in central Mumbai and houses between 800,000 and one million people&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in {{convert|2.39|km2|2|abbr=out}}, making it one of the most densely populated areas on Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.newschool.edu/epsm/2012/05/24/dharavi-mumbai/ |title=Dharavi, Mumbai &amp;#124; Sustainable Milano |publisher=Blogs.newschool.edu |date=24 May 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111004143/http://blogs.newschool.edu/epsm/2012/05/24/dharavi-mumbai/ |archive-date=11 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a population density of at least 334,728 persons per square kilometre.&lt;ref name="Town"&gt;{{cite web |title=District Census Handbook -MUMBAI SUBURBAN |url=https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/27/2722_PART_A_DCHB_MUMBAI%20SUBURBAN.pdf |publisher=Directorate of Census Operation Maharashtra |access-date=20 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumbai's culture is a blend of traditional festivals, food, music, and theatres. The city offers a cosmopolitan and diverse lifestyle with a variety of food, entertainment, and night life, available in a form and abundance comparable to that in other world capitals. Mumbai's history as a major trading centre has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions, and cuisines coexisting in the city. This unique blend of cultures is due to the migration of people from all over India since the British period.
