{{Periods in US history}}
The '''American Civil War''' (April 12, 1861 – May 9, 1865, also known by [[Names of the American Civil War|other names]]) was a [[civil war]] in the [[United States]] fought between [[Union (American Civil War)|northern and Pacific states]] ("the Union" or "the North") and [[southern United States|southern states]] that voted to [[secession|secede]] and form the [[Confederate States of America]] ("the Confederacy" or "the South").{{Efn|A formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] was never issued by either the [[United States Congress]] nor the [[Congress of the Confederate States]], as their legal positions were such that it was unnecessary.}} The central [[Origins of the American Civil War|cause of the war]] was the status of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], especially the expansion of slavery into newly acquired land after the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American War]]. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, four million of the 32 million Americans (nearly 13%) were [[African Americans|black]] slaves, mostly in the South.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=9}}

The practice of [[slavery in the United States]] was one of the key political issues of the 19th century; [[Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War|decades of political unrest over slavery led up to the war]]. [[Secession in the United States|Disunion]] came after [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|November 1860 presidential election]] on an anti-slavery expansion platform. An initial seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave states]] declared their secession from the country to form the Confederacy. After Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy, [[Crittenden Compromise|efforts at compromise]] failed and both sides prepared for war. Fighting broke out in April 1861 when the Confederate army attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]], just over a month after [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]]. An additional four slave states joined the Confederacy in the following two months. 

The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states (out of the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861), and asserted claims to two more. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on "[[King Cotton]]" that they would intervene,&lt;ref&gt;Yearns, Wilfred Buck. ''The Confederate Congress''. University of Georgia Press, 1960, 2010, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; but none did. The Confederate States of America were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the federal government were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} Large volunteer and conscription armies were raised; four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued.

During 1861–1862 in the war's [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], the Union made significant permanent gains, though in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], the conflict was inconclusive. In September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy by summer 1862, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] in 1864 to Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month [[Siege of Petersburg]], gateway to the Confederate capitol of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

The war [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|effectively ended]] on April 9, 1865, when Confederate General Lee [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]] to Union General Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], after abandoning Petersburg. Confederate generals throughout the Southern states followed suit, the last surrender on land occurring on June 23.  At the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy [[Conclusion of the American Civil War#Capture of Jefferson Davis (May 10, 1865)|collapsed]], slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved Black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the [[Reconstruction era]] in a partially successful attempt to rebuild the country and grant [[civil rights]] to freed slaves.

The Civil War is one of the most studied and [[Bibliography of the American Civil War|written about]] episodes in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]], and remains the subject of cultural and [[Historiographic issues about the American Civil War|historiographical debate]]. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]. The American Civil War was among the earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]]. Railroads, the [[telegraph]], steamships, [[Ironclad warship|iron-clad]] ships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. In total the war left between 620,000 and 750,000 soldiers dead,&lt;ref name="hacker" /&gt; along with an undetermined number of [[civilian casualties|civilians]],{{refn|name=Casualties|group=lower-alpha|A novel way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307–48}}}} as well as President Lincoln who [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|was assassinated]] just five days after Lee's surrender. The Civil War remains the deadliest military conflict in American history,{{Efn|Assuming Union and Confederate casualties are counted together – more Americans were killed in [[World War II]] than in either the Union or Confederate Armies if their casualty totals are counted separately.}} and accounted for more American military deaths than all other wars combined until the [[Vietnam War]].{{Efn|At least until approximately the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Civil War Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts|title=Civil War Facts|date =August 16, 2011|website=American Battlefield Trust|publisher=American Battlefield Trust|access-date=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation, and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and subsequent conflicts.

The causes of secession were complex and have been controversial since the war began, but most academic scholars&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;slavery as the central cause of the war. [[James C. Bradford]] wrote that the issue has been further complicated by [[Historical negationism|historical revisionists]], who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Bradford]], ''A Companion to American Military History'' (2010), vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the [[Timeline of United States history (1820–1859)#1850s|1850s]]. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was determined to prevent any spread of slavery to newly formed states, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, Lincoln, won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]]. After Lincoln won, many Southern leaders felt that disunion was their only option, fearing that the loss of representation would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=w_2odcYG-swC|page=99}}|title=The Road to Disunion: Volume II: Secessionists Triumphant, 1854–1861|last=Freehling|first=William W.|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-983991-9|language=en|pages= 9–24}} {{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=X_JGtAEACAAJ|page=111}}|title=Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress: 1789-1988|last=Martis|first=Kenneth C.|date=1989|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Books For Young Readers|isbn=978-0-02-920170-1| pages= 111–115}} and {{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=rQSYk-LWTxcC|page=18}}|title=Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War|last=Foner|first=Eric|date=October 2, 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972708-7|language=en |pages= 18–20, 21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Coates|first1=Ta-Nehisi|title=What This Cruel War Was Over|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/what-this-cruel-war-was-over/396482/|access-date=December 21, 2016|magazine=The Atlantic|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{Further|Slave Power}}

Slavery was the main cause of disunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|last=Gallagher|first=Gary|title=Remembering the Civil War|event=Sesquicentennial of the Start of the Civil War|date=February 21, 2011|location=Miller Center of Public Affairs UV|publisher=C-Span|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?298125-1/remembering-civil-war|access-date=August 29, 2017|language=en|quote=Issues related to the institution of slavery precipitated secession... It was not states' rights. It was not a tariff. It was not unhappiness with manner and customs that led to secession and eventually to war. It was a cluster of issues profoundly dividing the nation along a fault line delineated by the institution of slavery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=vii–viii}} Slavery had been a controversial issue during the framing of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], but had been left unsettled.&lt;ref&gt;Keith L. Dougherty, and Jac C. Heckelman. "Voting on slavery at the Constitutional Convention." ''Public Choice'' 136.3–4 (2008): 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of slavery had confounded the nation since its inception, and increasingly separated the United States into a slaveholding South and a free North. The issue was exacerbated by the rapid territorial expansion of the country, which repeatedly brought to the fore the issue of whether new territory should be slaveholding or free. The issue had dominated politics for decades leading up to the war. Key attempts to solve the issue included the [[Missouri Compromise]] and the [[Compromise of 1850]], but these only postponed an inevitable showdown over slavery.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=7-8}}

===Abolitionists===
{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}
[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by Harriet Beecher Stowe, aroused public opinion about the evils of slavery. According to legend, when Lincoln was introduced to her at the White House, his first words were, "So this is the little lady who started this Great War."&lt;ref&gt;, "[https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/harriet-beecher-stowe-little-lady-started-civil-war/ Harriet Beecher Stowe: The Little Lady Who Started the Civil War]".

The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] – those advocating the end of slavery – were very active in the decades leading up to the Civil War. They traced their philosophical roots back to the [[Puritans]], who strongly believed that slavery was morally wrong. One of the early Puritan writings on this subject was ''The Selling of Joseph,'' by [[Samuel Sewall]] in 1700. In it, Sewall condemned slavery and the slave trade and refuted many of the era's typical justifications for slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Sewall, Samuel. ''The Selling of Joseph,'' pp. 1–3, Bartholomew Green &amp; John Allen, Boston, Massachusetts, 1700.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough, David p. 132-3"&gt;McCullough, David. ''John Adams,'' p. 132-3, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, New York, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-81363-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Revolution]] and the cause of liberty added tremendous impetus to the abolitionist cause. Slavery, which had been around for thousands of years, was considered "normal" and was not a significant issue of public debate prior to the Revolution. The Revolution changed that and made it into an issue that had to be addressed. As a result, during and shortly after the Revolution, the northern states quickly started outlawing slavery. Even in southern states, laws were changed to limit slavery and facilitate [[manumission]]. The amount of indentured servitude (temporary slavery) dropped dramatically throughout the country. An [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] sailed through Congress with little opposition. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] supported it, and it went into effect on January 1, 1808. [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[James Madison]] each helped found manumission societies. Influenced by the Revolution, many individual slave owners, such as [[George Washington]], freed their slaves, often in their wills. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population in the upper South increased from less than 1 percent to nearly 10 percent between 1790 and 1810 as a result of these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ketcham, Ralph.

"By 1775, inspired by those 'self-evident' truths which were to be expressed by the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a considerable number of colonists felt that the time had come to end slavery and give the free Negroes some fruits of liberty. This sentiment, added to economic considerations, led to the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery in six northern states, while there was a swelling flood of private manumissions in the South. Little actual gain was made by the free Negro even in this period, and by the turn of the century, the downward trend had begun again. Thereafter the only important change in that trend before the Civil War was that after 1831 the decline in the status of the free Negro became more precipitate."&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the [[Northwest Territory]] as "free soil" – no slavery – by [[Manasseh Cutler]] and [[Rufus Putnam]] (who both came from Puritan New England) would also prove crucial. This territory (which became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota) doubled the size of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

In the decades leading up to the Civil War, abolitionists, such as [[Theodore Parker]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], repeatedly used the Puritan heritage of the country to bolster their cause. The most radical anti-slavery newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]],'' invoked the Puritans and Puritan values over a thousand times. Parker, in urging New England Congressmen to support the abolition of slavery, wrote that "The son of the Puritan ... is sent to Congress to stand up for Truth and Right..."&lt;ref&gt;Gradert, Kenyon. ''Puritan Spirits in the Abolitionist Imagination,'' pp. 1–3, 14–5, 24, 29–30, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, and London, 2020. {{ISBN|978-0-226-69402-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele. ''Theodore Parker,'' pp. 206, 208–9, 210, The Beacon Press, Boston, Massachusetts, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature served as a means to spread the message to common folks. Key works included ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]'', the [[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave|''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass'']], ''[[American Slavery as It Is]]'', and the most important: ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', the best selling book of the 19th century aside from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Anderson|first=Mic|date=|title=8 Influential Abolitionist Texts|url=https://www.britannica.com/list/8-influential-abolitionist-texts|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-07|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=38}}&lt;ref name="GailSmith"&gt;"The Sentimental Novel: The Example of Harriet Beecher Stowe" by Gail K.

By 1840 more than 15,000 people were members of abolitionist societies in the United States. Abolitionism in the United States became a popular expression of [[moralism]], and led directly to the Civil War. In churches, conventions and newspapers, reformers promoted an absolute and immediate rejection of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Young People's Encyclopedia of the United States|last=Shapiro|first=William E.|date=1993|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=1-56294-514-9|location=Brookfield, Conn.|oclc=30932823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Robins |first=R.G. |title=A.J. Tomlinson: Plainfolk Modernist |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-988317-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for abolition among the religious was not universal though. As the war approached, even the main denominations split along political lines, forming rival southern and northern churches. For example, [[Baptists]] split into the [[Northern Baptists]] and [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]] over the issue of slavery in 1845.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 2018|title=Report on Slavery and Racism in the History of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|url=http://www.sbts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Racism-and-the-Legacy-of-Slavery-Report-v4.pdf#page=6|access-date=July 29, 2019|publisher=Southern Baptist Theological Seminary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abolitionist sentiment was not strictly religious or moral in origin. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] became increasingly opposed to slavery because they saw it as inherently against the ideals of capitalism and the free market. Whig leader [[William H. Seward]] (who would serve in Lincoln's cabinet) proclaimed that there was an "irrepressible conflict" between slavery and free labor, and that slavery had left the South backward and undeveloped.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=39}} As the Whig party dissolved in the 1850s, the mantle of abolition fell to its newly formed successor, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].{{Sfn|Donald|1995|p=188-189}}

===Territorial crisis===
{{Further|Slave states and free states}}
[[Manifest destiny]] heightened the conflict over slavery, as each new territory acquired had to face the thorny question of whether to allow or disallow the "peculiar institution".{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=41-46}} Between 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest. At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49–50}}

The [[Mexican–American War]] and its aftermath was a key territorial event in the leadup to the war.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=49-77}} As the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] finalized the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190–93}} Prophetically, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that "Mexico will poison us", referring to the ensuing divisions around whether the newly conquered lands would end up slave or free.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=51}} Northern "free soil" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following [[California]] were all free: [[Minnesota]] (1858), [[Oregon]] (1859), and [[Kansas]] (1861). In the Southern states, the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13–14}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: "The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself."{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}

By 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories, and they all claimed they were sanctioned by the Constitution, implicitly or explicitly.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|pp=19–21}} The first of these "conservative" theories, represented by the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], argued that the [[Missouri Compromise]] apportionment of territory north for free soil and south for slavery should become a Constitutional mandate. The [[Crittenden Compromise]] of 1860 was an expression of this view.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=20}}

The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance—that slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 at the discretion of Congress;{{sfn|Russell|1966|p=468–69}} thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The ill-fated [[Wilmot Proviso]] announced this position in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Eff8PJuBt5IC}}|title=American Law and the Constitutional Order: Historical Perspectives|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=69|issue=2|pages=327–352|editor-last=Friedman|editor-first=Lawrence Meir|editor-last2=Scheiber|editor-first2=Harry N.|date=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02527-1|language=en|last=Bestor |first=Arthur |chapter=The American Civil War as a Constitutional Crisis |jstor=1844986|doi=10.2307/1844986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Proviso was a pivotal moment in national politics, as it was the first time slavery had become a major congressional issue based on sectionalism, instead of party lines. Its bipartisan support by northern Democrats and Whigs, and bipartisan opposition by southerners was a dark omen of coming divisions.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=52-54}}

Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] proclaimed the doctrine of territorial or "popular" sovereignty—which asserted that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to establish or disestablish slavery as a purely local matter.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|pp=21–23}} The [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854 legislated this doctrine.{{sfn|Johannsen|1973|p=406}} In the Kansas Territory, years of [[Bleeding Kansas|pro and anti-slavery violence]] and political conflict erupted; the congressional House of Representatives voted to admit Kansas as a free state in early 1860, but its admission did not pass the Senate until January 1861, after the departure of Southern senators.&lt;ref name=Politics&gt;{{cite web|title=Territorial Politics and Government |url=http://www.territorialkansasonline.org/~imlskto/cgi-bin/index.php?SCREEN=pol_govt&amp;option=more |publisher=Territorial Kansas Online: University of Kansas and Kansas Historical Society| access-date=July 10, 2014}}Finteg&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth theory was advocated by Mississippi Senator [[Jefferson Davis]],{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=21}} one of state sovereignty ("states' rights"),{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=23}} also known as the "Calhoun doctrine",{{sfn|Varon|2008|p=58}} named after the South Carolinian political theorist and statesman [[John C. Calhoun]].{{sfn|Russell|1966|p=470}} Rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the federal union under the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=23–24}} "States' rights" was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=7}} As historian Thomas L. Krannawitter points out, the "Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of Federal power."{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=232}}&lt;ref&gt;Gara, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;190&lt;/ref&gt; These four doctrines comprised the dominant ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery, the territories, and the U.S. Constitution before the 1860 presidential election.{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=24–25}}

===States' rights===
The South argued that just as each state had decided to join the Union, a state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time. Northerners (including pro-slavery President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], who said they were setting up a perpetual union.&lt;ref name="Forrest McDonald 2002" /&gt;

The consensus among historians is that the Civil War was not fought about states' rights.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Flanagin|first=Jake|title=For the last time, the American Civil War was not about states' rights|url=https://qz.com/378533/for-the-last-time-the-american-civil-war-was-not-about-states-rights/|access-date=2021-06-12|website=Quartz|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

{{quote|While [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|one or more of these interpretations]] remain popular among the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the states'-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, states' rights for what purpose? States' rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=3–9}}}}

Before the Civil War, the Southern states used federal powers in enforcing and extending slavery at the national level, with the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|decision]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-07-03|title=States' Rights, the Slave Power Conspiracy, and the Causes of the Civil War|url=https://concerninghistory.org/general/states-rights-the-slave-power-conspiracy-and-the-cause-of-the-civil-war/|access-date=2021-06-12|website=Concerning History|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faction that pushed for secession often infringed on states' rights. Because of the overrepresentation of pro-slavery factions in the federal government, many Northerners, even non-abolitionists, feared the [[Slave Power]] conspiracy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some Northern states resisted the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Historian [[Eric Foner]] stated the act "could hardly have been designed to arouse greater opposition in the North. It overrode numerous state and local laws and legal procedures and 'commanded' individual citizens to assist, when called upon, in capturing runaways." He continues, "It certainly did not reveal, on the part of slaveholders, sensitivity to states’ rights."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=When the South Wasn't a Fan of States' Rights|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/underground-railroad-states-rights-114536|access-date=2021-06-12|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Paul Finkelman]] "the southern states mostly complained that the northern states were asserting their states’ rights and that the national government was not powerful enough to counter these northern claims."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|date=2015-06-24|title=States' Rights, Southern Hypocrisy, and the Crisis of the Union|url=https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol45/iss2/5|journal=Akron Law Review|volume=45|issue=2|issn=0002-371X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate constitution also "federally" required slavery to be legal in all Confederate states and claimed territories.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McCurry|first=Stephanie|date=2020-06-21|title=The Confederacy Was an Antidemocratic, Centralized State|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/confederacy-wasnt-what-you-think/613309/|access-date=2021-06-12|website=The Atlantic|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectionalism===
[[Sectionalism]] resulted from the different economies, social structure, customs, and political values of the North and South.&lt;ref name="sectionalism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sectionalism17" /&gt; Regional tensions came to a head during the [[War of 1812]], resulting in the [[Hartford Convention]], which manifested Northern dissatisfaction with a foreign trade embargo that affected the industrial North disproportionately, the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], dilution of Northern power by new states, and a succession of [[Virginia dynasty|Southern presidents]]. Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648–649}}

Historians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the [[economic determinism]] of historian [[Charles A. Beard]] in the 1920s, and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. While socially different, the sections economically benefited each other.&lt;ref name="progressive" /&gt;{{sfn|Woodworth|1996|pp=145, 151, 505, 512, 554, 557, 684}}

===Protectionism===
Owners of slaves preferred low-cost manual labor with no mechanization. Northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while Southern planters demanded free trade.{{sfn|Thornton|Ekelund|2004|p=21}} The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816. The Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.&lt;ref name="taussig" /&gt;{{sfn|Hofstadter|1938|p=50–55}} The tariff issue was a Northern grievance. However, [[neo-Confederate]] writers{{who|date=May 2020}} have claimed it as a Southern grievance. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gray Gunderson, ''Old Gentleman's Convention: The Washington Peace Conference of 1861.'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon L. Wakelyn|title=Southern Pamphlets on Secession, November 1860 – April 1861|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=By6K9VHfWtIC|page=23}}|year=1996|publisher=U. of North Carolina Press|pages=23–30|isbn=978-0-8078-6614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism and honor===
[[File:Marais-massacre.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Marais des Cygnes massacre]] of anti-slavery Kansans, May 19, 1858]]
Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called "Unionists") and those loyal primarily to the Southern region and then the Confederacy.{{sfn|Potter|1962|p=924–50}}

Perceived insults to Southern collective honor included the enormous popularity of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''&lt;ref name="southern" /&gt; and the actions of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in trying to incite a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|rebellion of slaves]] in 1859.&lt;ref name="nationalism" /&gt;

While the South moved towards a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded, and they rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as [[treason]] and would not tolerate it.&lt;ref name="republican18" /&gt; The South ignored the warnings; Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.&lt;ref name="nationalism19" /&gt;

===Lincoln's election===
{{Main|1860 United States presidential election}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln seated, Feb 9, 1864.jpg|thumb|190px|Abraham Lincoln in 1864|alt=Middle aged man with beard sitting]]

The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.{{sfn|Potter|Fehrenbacher|1976|p=485}} Efforts at compromise, including the [[Corwin Amendment]] and the [[Crittenden Compromise]], failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.

According to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9953-7|language=en|page=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of the war==

===Secession crisis===
The election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of [[South Carolina]] to call a state convention to consider secession. Before the war, South Carolina did more than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the right to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] federal laws, and even to secede from the United States. The convention unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted [[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|a secession declaration]]. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. The "cotton states" of [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], Georgia, Louisiana, and [[Texas]] followed suit, seceding in January and February 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1861 {{!}} Time Line of the Civil War|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/articles-and-essays/time-line-of-the-civil-war/1861/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-12|website=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states, those of three—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned the plight of the "slaveholding states" at the hands of Northern abolitionists.

The Southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] of the Constitution. These states agreed to form a new federal government, the [[Confederate States of America]], on February 4, 1861.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=24}} They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [[Dred Scott decision]] was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union "was intended to be perpetual", but that "The power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union" was not among the "enumerated powers granted to Congress".&lt;ref name="ucsb" /&gt; One-quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [[David E.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass projects that had been blocked by Southern senators before the war. These included the [[Morrill Tariff]], land grant colleges (the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]]), a [[Homestead Acts#Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]], a transcontinental railroad (the [[Pacific Railroad Acts]]),&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4608/ |title=Profile Showing the Grades upon the Different Routes Surveyed for the Union Pacific Rail Road Between the Missouri River and the Valley of the Platte River |publisher=[[World Digital Library]] |year=1865 |access-date=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Bank Act]], the authorization of [[United States Note]]s by the [[Legal Tender Act of 1862]], and the ending of [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|slavery in the District of Columbia]]. The [[Revenue Act of 1861]] introduced the [[income tax]] to help finance the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=Abraham Lincoln imposes first federal income tax|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lincoln-imposes-first-federal-income-tax|access-date=2021-06-12|website=HISTORY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 1860, the [[Crittenden Compromise]] was proposed to re-establish the [[Missouri Compromise]] line by constitutionally banning slavery in territories to the north of the line while guaranteeing it to the south. The adoption of this compromise likely would have prevented the secession of every Southern state apart from South Carolina, but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, James Ford.

The Republicans proposed an [[Corwin Amendment|alternative compromise]] to not interfere with slavery where it existed but the South regarded it as insufficient. Nonetheless, the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=234–266}}

[[File:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jefferson Davis]], [[President of the Confederate States of America]] (1861–1865)|alt=Middle-aged man in a goatee posed standing in a suit, vest and bowtie]]

On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as president. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a ''[[Preamble to the United States Constitution|more perfect union]]'' than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession "legally void".&lt;ref name="inaugural" /&gt; He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but said that he would use force to maintain possession of Federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. marshals and judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia, and North Carolina. He stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify the armed revolution during his administration. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union, famously calling on "the mystic chords of memory" binding the two regions.&lt;ref name="inaugural" /&gt;

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties{{which|date=January 2018}} and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.{{sfn|Potter|Fehrenbacher|1976|p=572–73}} Secretary of State [[William H.

===Battle of Fort Sumter===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Fort sumter 1861.jpg|thumb|left|The Confederate "Stars and Bars" flying from Fort Sumter|alt=Flagpole in a ruined building]]
Fort Sumter is located in the middle of the harbor of [[Charleston in the American Civil War|Charleston]], South Carolina. Its garrison had recently moved there to avoid incidents with local militias in the streets of the city. Lincoln told its commander, Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] to hold on until fired upon. Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered the surrender of the fort. Anderson gave a conditional reply that the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. He bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12–13, forcing its capitulation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The attack on Fort Sumter enormously invigorated the North to the defense of American nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The War for the Union: The Improvised War 1861–1862'' (1959), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Great Meeting Union Square.jpg|thumb|Mass meeting in New York City April 20, 1861, to support the Union in the aftermath of Sumter|alt=Engraving of large protest]]

Lincoln called on all the states to send forces to recapture the fort and other federal properties. The scale of the rebellion appeared to be small, so he called for only [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 volunteers]] for 90&amp;nbsp;days.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=274}} In western Missouri, local secessionists seized [[Liberty Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard Louis Conard|title=Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6BPVAAAAMAAJ|page=45}}|year=1901|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 3, 1861, Lincoln called for an additional 42,000 volunteers for a period of three years, which backfired.&lt;ref name="Proclamation 83 – Increasing the Size of the Army and Navy" /&gt; Four states in the middle and upper South had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, but now [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy.

===Attitude of the border states===

[[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]] were slave states that were opposed to both secession and coercing the South. [[West Virginia]] then joined them as an additional border state after it separated from [[Virginia]] and became a state of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1863.

Maryland's territory surrounded the United States' capital of [[Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C.]], and could cut it off from the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/7590/html/0000.html|title=Civil War and the Maryland General Assembly, Maryland State Archives|website=msa.maryland.gov|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had numerous anti-Lincoln officials who tolerated anti-army [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and the burning of bridges, both aimed at hindering the passage of troops to the South. Maryland's legislature voted overwhelmingly (53–13) to stay in the Union, but also rejected hostilities with its southern neighbors, voting to close Maryland's rail lines to prevent them from being used for war.&lt;ref name="Maryland State Archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html|title=Teaching American History in Maryland – Documents for the Classroom: ''Arrest of the Maryland Legislature, 1861''|publisher=Maryland State Archives|year=2005|access-date=February 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111110628/http://teachingamericanhistorymd.net/000001/000000/000017/html/t17.html |archive-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln responded by establishing [[martial law]] and unilaterally suspending [[habeas corpus]] in Maryland, along with sending in militia units from the North.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=284–87}} Lincoln rapidly took control of Maryland and the District of Columbia by seizing many prominent figures, including arresting 1/3 of the members of the [[Maryland General Assembly]] on the day it reconvened.&lt;ref name="Maryland State Archives" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William C. Harris, ''Lincoln and the Border States: Preserving the Union'' (University Press of Kansas, 2011), p. 71,&lt;/ref&gt; All were held without trial, ignoring a ruling by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court [[Roger Taney]], a Maryland native, that only Congress (and not the president) could suspend habeas corpus ([[Ex parte Merryman]]). Federal troops imprisoned a prominent Baltimore newspaper editor, [[Frank Key Howard]], Francis Scott Key's grandson, after he criticized Lincoln in an editorial for ignoring the Supreme Court Chief Justice's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=F.

In Missouri, an [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861–63)|elected convention]] on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state (''see also'': [[Missouri secession]]). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.&lt;ref name="nevins" /&gt;

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces in 1861, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, formed the shadow [[Confederate Government of Kentucky]], inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth and went into exile for good after October 1862.&lt;ref name="nevins26" /&gt;

After Virginia's secession, a [[Restored Government of Virginia|Unionist government]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34 percent approved the statehood bill (96 percent approving).&lt;ref name="Convenience WV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/History/statehood/statehood10.html |title=A State of Convenience, The Creation of West Virginia |publisher=West Virginia Archives &amp; History |access-date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties&lt;ref name="copperhead" /&gt; in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war engaged about 40,000 Federal troops for much of the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=303}}{{sfn|Weigley|2004|p=55}} Congress admitted [[West Virginia]] to the Union on June 20, 1863. West Virginia provided about 20,000–22,000 soldiers to both the Confederacy and the Union.&lt;ref name="charleston" /&gt;

A Unionist secession attempt occurred in [[East Tennessee]], but was suppressed by the Confederacy, which arrested over 3,000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union. They were held without trial.{{sfn|Neely|1993|p=10–11}}

==General features of the war==
{{See also|List of American Civil War battles|Military leadership in the American Civil War}}The Civil War was a contest marked by the ferocity and frequency of battle. Over four years, 237 named battles were fought, as were many more minor actions and skirmishes, which were often characterized by their bitter intensity and high casualties. In his book ''The American Civil War'', John Keegan writes that "The American Civil War was to prove one of the most ferocious wars ever fought". In many cases, without geographic objectives, the only target for each side was the enemy's soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, "The American Civil War", p. 73. Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40 percent of them in Virginia and Tennessee. See Gabor Boritt, ed. ''War Comes Again'' (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobilization===
{{See also|Child soldiers in the American Civil War}}
As the first seven states began organizing a Confederacy in Montgomery, the entire U.S. army numbered 16,000. However, Northern governors had begun to mobilize their militias.&lt;ref&gt;''"With an actual strength of 1,080 officers and 14,926 enlisted men on June 30, 1860, the Regular Army&amp;nbsp;..."''

By May, Jefferson Davis was pushing for 100,000 men under arms for one year or the duration, and that was answered in kind by the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9lAfAQAAIAAJ|page=264}}|title=Abraham Lincoln: A History|last1=Nicolay|first1=John George|last2=Hay|first2=John|date=1890|publisher=Century Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Z2_ZM0dWVrsC|page=308}}|title=The Confederate States of America, 1861—1865: A History of the South|last=Coulter|first=E.

Coulter reports that Alexander Stephens took this to mean Davis wanted unilateral control of a standing army, and from that moment on became his implacable opponent.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law—[[conscription]]—as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt.&lt;ref name="questia" /&gt; The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers.

When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City]] in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the [[Tammany Hall|city's Democratic political machine]], not realizing it made them liable for the draft.&lt;ref name="reconstruct" /&gt; Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their services conscripted.&lt;ref name="murdock" /&gt;

In both the North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular. In the North, some 120,000 men evaded conscription, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 soldiers deserted during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lee Hallock, "The Role of the Community in Civil War Desertion."

From a tiny frontier force in 1860, the Union and Confederate armies had grown into the "largest and most efficient armies in the world" within a few years. European observers at the time dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional, but British historian [[John Keegan]] concluded that each outmatched the French, Prussian and Russian armies of the time, and without the Atlantic, would have threatened any of them with defeat.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=57}}

===Prisoners===
{{Main|American Civil War prison camps}}
At the start of the civil war, a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their army. They were paid, but they were not allowed to perform any military duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Pickenpaugh|title=Captives in Blue: The Civil War Prisons of the Confederacy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pWOfsOceCNUC|page=57}}|year=2013|publisher=University of Alabama Press|pages=57–73|isbn=978-0-8173-1783-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. After that, about 56,000 of the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the war, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the conflict's fatalities.{{sfn|Tucker|Pierpaoli|White|2010|p=1466}}

===Women===
{{See also|Women in the military#United States|Timeline of women in war in the United States, Pre-1945}}

Historian [[Elizabeth D.

[[Mary Edwards Walker]], the only woman ever to receive the [[Medal of Honor]], served in the Union Army and was given the medal for her efforts to treat the wounded during the war.

==Naval tactics==
The small [[Union Navy|U.S. Navy]] of 1861 was rapidly enlarged to 6,000 officers and 45,000 men in 1865, with 671 vessels, having a tonnage of 510,396.{{sfn|Welles|1865|p=152}}{{sfn|Tucker|Pierpaoli|White|2010|p=462}} Its mission was to blockade Confederate ports, take control of the river system, defend against Confederate raiders on the high seas, and be ready for a possible war with the British [[Royal Navy]].{{sfn|Canney|1998|p=?}} Meanwhile, the main riverine war was fought in the West, where a series of major rivers gave access to the Confederate heartland. The U.S. Navy eventually gained control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.

===Modern navy evolves===
[[File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Clashes on the rivers were melees of [[ironclads]], [[Cottonclad warship|cottonclads]], [[gunboats]] and [[Ram (ship)|rams]], complicated by naval mines and [[Fire ship|fire rafts]].|alt=Engraving of naval battle]]The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the [[ironclad warship]]. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=92}} Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating "ram fever" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}}

[[File:Battle of Hampton Roads 3g01752u.jpg|240px|thumb|left| Battle between the ''Monitor'' and ''Merrimack''|alt=Painting of land battle scene in foreground and naval battle with sinking ships in background]]

In addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action.&lt;ref&gt;Myron J. Smith, ''Tinclads in the Civil War: Union Light-Draught Gunboat Operations on Western Waters, 1862–1865'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy experimented with the [[submarine]] {{ship|CSS|Hunley}}, which did not work satisfactorily,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald F. Teaster and Linda and James Treaster Ambrose, ''The Confederate Submarine H. L. Hunley'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and with building an ironclad ship, {{ship|CSS|Virginia}}, which was based on rebuilding a sunken Union ship, {{USS|Merrimack|1855|2}}. On its first foray on March 8, 1862, ''Virginia'' inflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad, {{USS|Monitor}}, arrived to challenge it in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The resulting three-hour [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] was a draw, but it proved that ironclads were effective warships.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=345}} Not long after the battle, the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the ''Virginia'' to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''. Lacking the technology and infrastructure to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. However, this failed as Great Britain had no interest in selling warships to a nation that was at war with a far stronger enemy, and it meant it could sour relations with the [[United States|U.S.]].{{sfn|Fuller|2008|p=36}}

=== Union blockade ===
{{Main|Union blockade}}

Tightening naval blockade, forcing rebels out of Missouri along the Mississippi River, Kentucky Unionists sit on the fence, idled cotton industry illustrated in Georgia.|alt=A cartoon map of the South surrounded by a snake.]]

By early 1861, General [[Winfield Scott]] had devised the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible.{{sfn|Richter|2009|p=49}} Scott argued that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln adopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day volunteers. Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=228}}

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. "King Cotton" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288–89, 296–98}}

==== Blockade runners ====
{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}
[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads. [[Union blockade#South Atlantic Blockading Squadron|South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] off Charleston. Continuous blockade of all major ports was sustained by North's overwhelming war production.|alt=Panoramic view of ships in harbor during battle]]

British investors built small, fast, steam-driven [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Britain through Bermuda, Cuba, and the Bahamas in return for high-priced cotton. Many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out.{{sfn|Stern|1962|pp=224–225}} When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a [[prize of war]] and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British, and they were released.&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Neely, Jr. "The Perils of Running the Blockade: The Influence of International Law in an Era of Total War," ''Civil War History'' (1986) 32#2, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–18 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v032/32.2.neely.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic impact====
The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war. There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.

Most historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Surdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade, so they stopped calling at Confederate ports.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

To fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships in Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war ended, the U.S. government demanded that Britain compensate them for the damage done by the raiders outfitted in British ports. Britain acquiesced to their demand, paying the U.S. $15&amp;nbsp;million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}

==Diplomacy==
{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}

Although the Confederacy hoped that [[United Kingdom and the American Civil War|Britain]] and [[France and the American Civil War|France]] would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546–57}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]], worked to block this and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe turned to Egypt and India for cotton, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}&lt;ref name="nevins73" /&gt;

[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]
[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that "King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and ships to transport weapons.&lt;ref name="nevins73" /&gt;

Lincoln's administration initially failed to appeal to European public opinion. At first, diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, started off much more successful, by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The European aristocracy was "absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014), pp. 8 (quote), 69–70, 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was still a European public with liberal sensibilities, that the U.S. sought to appeal to by building connections with the international press. As early as 1861, many Union diplomats such as [[Carl Schurz]] realized emphasizing the war against slavery was the Union's most effective moral asset in the struggle for public opinion in Europe. Seward was concerned that an overly radical case for reunification would distress the European aristocrats with cotton interests; even so, Seward supported a widespread campaign of public diplomacy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

U.S. [[Ambassador|minister]] to Britain [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept and convinced Britain not to openly challenge the Union blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ({{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}, {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}}, {{ship|CSS|Florida}}, and some others). The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery in Britain created a political liability for British politicians, where the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery movement]] was powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] was possibly to credit for calming down tensions by rewriting {{What|reason=Rewriting what?|date=July 2021}}while his death lead to a malaise that quieted calls for war.{{Clarify|reason=Unfinished,unclear text. Rewritting what?|date=July 2021}}

War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British government considered mediating between the Union and Confederacy, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on what his decision would be.&lt;ref name="approaching" /&gt;

The Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused the British to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Realizing that Washington could not intervene in [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico|Mexico]] as long as the Confederacy controlled Texas, [[French intervention in Mexico|France invaded Mexico]] in 1861. Washington repeatedly protested France's violation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's seizure of Mexico ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}

[[Russian Empire|Russia]] supported the Union, largely due to the view that the U.S. served as a counterbalance to their geopolitical rival, the United Kingdom. In 1863, the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]]'s Baltic and Pacific fleets wintered in the American ports of New York and San Francisco, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Norman E. Saul, Richard D. McKinzie. ''Russian-American Dialogue on Cultural Relations, 1776–1914'' p 95. {{ISBN|0-8262-1097-X}}, 9780826210975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern theater==
[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year|alt=Map of the United States with counties colored]]

{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].

=== Background ===
; Army of the Potomac
Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}

# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.
# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.
# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.
# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.
[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee|alt=Old man with gray beard and military uniform]]
; Army of Northern Virginia

The primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.

When Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.

Lee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, before that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. 
[[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862|alt=Engraving of chaotic battle scene]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.

=== Battles ===
;First Bull Run

In one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas).

[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|[[Stonewall Jackson|"Stonewall" Jackson]] got his nickname at Bull Run.|alt=Middle aged man with large beard in military uniform]]
The Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]], stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, "Stonewall".

; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign
[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan|alt=Man with mustache and military uniform, striking a Napoleon pose]]
Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464–519}}&lt;ref name="terrible" /&gt;{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424–27}}

Also in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&amp;nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Frémont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of "[[foot cavalry]]".

Johnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538–44}}

;Second Bull Run
The [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528–33}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.

;Antietam
[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.|alt=Painting of battlefield scene]]

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538–44}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543–45}} Lee's army checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=557–558}}

;First Fredericksburg
When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=571–74}} on December 13, 1862, when more than 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].
[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Confederate dead overrun at Marye's Heights, reoccupied next day May 4, 1863|alt=Trench with abandoned rifles and dead men]]
;Chancellorsville
Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, his Chancellorsville Campaign proved ineffective and he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=639–45}} Chancellorsville is known as Lee's "perfect battle" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory. Gen. Stonewall Jackson was shot in the arm by accidental friendly fire during the battle and subsequently died of complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EHRDCgAAQBAJ|page=93}}|page=93|title=Stonewall Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign|author=Jonathan A. Noyalas|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|date=December 3, 2010|isbn=978-1-61423-040-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee famously said: "He has lost his left arm, but I have lost my right arm."

The fiercest fighting of the battle—and the second bloodiest day of the Civil War—occurred on May 3 as Lee launched multiple attacks against the Union position at Chancellorsville. That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west. The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the [[Battle of Salem Church]].

;Gettysburg

Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]] during Lee's [[Gettysburg Campaign|second invasion of the North]], in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (July 1 to 3, 1863).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=653–663}} This was the bloodiest battle of the war and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=664}}

==Western theater==
{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
The Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the [[Mississippi River]], including the states of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]], as well as parts of [[Louisiana]].

=== Background ===
; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland
[[File:Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (4228634580).jpg|thumb|160px|Ulysses S. Grant]]
The primary Union forces in the Western theater were the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and the [[Army of the Cumberland]], named for the two rivers, the [[Tennessee River]] and [[Cumberland River]]. After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].

; Army of Tennessee
The primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.

=== Battles ===
;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of "Unconditional Surrender" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.

[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's "Gibraltar of the West" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.

[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]
;Shiloh
At the [[Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed additional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won a decisive victory—the first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over.{{sfn|Frank|Reaves|2003|p= 170}} The Confederates lost [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], considered their finest general before the emergence of Lee.

;Union Navy captures Memphis
[[File:Cgs05255 (9716190703).jpg|thumb|By 1863 the Union controlled large portions of the Western Theater, especially areas surrounding the Mississippi river]]
One of the early Union objectives in the war was the capture of the [[Mississippi River]], to cut the Confederacy in half. The Mississippi River was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], Missouri, and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

In April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] [[Capture of New Orleans|captured New Orleans]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=418–20}} "The key to the river was New Orleans, the South's largest port [and] greatest industrial center."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Naval forces under [[David Farragut|Farragut]] ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans. Confederate forces abandoned the city, giving the Union a critical anchor in the deep South.{{sfn|Symonds|Clipson|2001|p= 92}} which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. [[Battle of Memphis|Memphis fell to Union forces]] on June 6, 1862, and became a key base for further advances south along the Mississippi River. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, prevented Union control of the entire river.

;Perryville
Bragg's second invasion of Kentucky in the [[Confederate Heartland Offensive]] included initial successes such as [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]]'s triumph at the [[Battle of Richmond]] and the capture of the Kentucky capital of Frankfort on September 3, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Kent Masterson |title=The Civil War in Kentucky: Battle for the Bluegrass State |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the [[Battle of Perryville]]. Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of logistical support and lack of infantry recruits for the Confederacy in that state.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=419–20}}

; Stones River
Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in [[Tennessee]], the culmination of the [[Stones River Campaign]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=480–83}}

;Vicksburg
Naval forces assisted Grant in the long, complex [[Vicksburg Campaign]] that resulted in the Confederates surrendering at the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vicksburg]] in July 1863, which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning points]] of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Scott Mangum, "The Vicksburg Campaign: A Study In Joint Operations," ''Parameters: U.S. Army War College'' (1991) 21#3, pp.&amp;nbsp;74–86 [https://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/Articles/1991/1991%20mangum.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127192600/https://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/Articles/1991/1991%20mangum.pdf |date=November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chickamauga
[[File:Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the highest two-day losses]]

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. After Rosecrans' successful [[Tullahoma Campaign]], Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]].

; Third Chattanooga
Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged in the [[Chattanooga Campaign]]. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Third Battle of Chattanooga]],{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=677–80}} eventually causing Longstreet to abandon his [[Knoxville Campaign]] and driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

==Trans-Mississippi theater==
{{details|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}

=== Background ===
The Trans-Mississippi theater refers to military operations west of the Mississippi River, not including the areas bordering the Pacific Ocean.

=== Battles ===
;Missouri
[[File:Wilson's Creek charge of 1st Iowa.jpg|thumb|[[Nathaniel Lyon]] secured St. Louis docks and arsenal, led Union forces to expel Missouri Confederate forces and government.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=100}}]]
The first battle of the Trans-Mississippi theater was the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]]. The Confederates were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=404–05}}

Extensive [[guerrilla warfare]] characterized the trans-Mississippi region, as the Confederacy lacked the troops and the logistics to support regular armies that could challenge Union control.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Martin, ''Third War: Irregular Warfare on the Western Border 1861–1865'' (Combat Studies Institute Leavenworth Paper series, number 23, 2012). See also, Michael Fellman, ''Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri during the Civil War'' (1989). Missouri alone was the scene of over 1,000 engagements between regular units, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands, especially in the recently settled western counties.&lt;/ref&gt; Roving Confederate bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohl|first1=Sarah|year=2004|title=A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri|journal=Prologue|volume=36|issue=1|pages=44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Sons of Liberty" and "Order of the American Knights" attacked pro-Union people, elected officeholders, and unarmed uniformed soldiers. These partisans could not be entirely driven out of the state of Missouri until an entire regular Union infantry division was engaged. By 1864, these violent activities harmed the nationwide anti-war movement organizing against the re-election of Lincoln. Missouri not only stayed in the Union but Lincoln took 70 percent of the vote for re-election.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=270}}

;New Mexico
Numerous small-scale military actions south and west of Missouri sought to control [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|New Mexico Territory]] for the Union. The [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] was the decisive [[battle]] of the [[New Mexico Campaign]]. The Union repulsed Confederate incursions into New Mexico in 1862, and the exiled Arizona government withdrew into Texas. In the Indian Territory, civil war broke out within tribes. About 12,000 Indian warriors fought for the Confederacy and smaller numbers for the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=William H.|year=1991|title=Indian Soldiers for the Gray Army: Confederate Recruitment in Indian Territory|journal=Chronicles of Oklahoma|volume=69|issue=2|pages=134–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent Cherokee was Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]], the last Confederate general to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neet|first1=J. Frederick|last2=Jr|year=1996|title=Stand Watie: Confederate General in the Cherokee Nation|journal=Great Plains Journal|volume=6|issue=1|pages=36–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Texas
After the fall of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] in July 1863, General Kirby Smith in Texas was informed by Jefferson Davis that he could expect no further help from east of the Mississippi River. Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies, he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler, along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy, a virtual "independent fiefdom" in Texas, including railroad construction and international smuggling. The Union, in turn, did not directly engage him.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=220–21}} Its 1864 [[Red River Campaign]] to take Shreveport, Louisiana, was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.

== Lower Seaboard theater ==
{{details|Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War}}

=== Background ===
The Lower Seaboard theater refers to military and naval operations that occurred near the coastal areas of the Southeast (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas) as well as the southern part of the Mississippi River (Port Hudson and south). Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.

=== Battles ===
;South Carolina
One of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches; by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.

;Georgia
Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after repairing it.

;Louisiana
[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb|New Orleans captured.]]
In April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname "Beast".

The following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]] but surrendered after Vicksburg. These two surrenders gave the Union control over the entire Mississippi.

;Florida
Several small skirmishes were fought in Florida, but no major battles. The biggest was the [[Battle of Olustee]] in early 1864.

==Pacific Coast theater==
{{details|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}
The Pacific Coast theater refers to military operations on the Pacific Ocean and in the states and Territories west of the Continental Divide.

==Conquest of Virginia==
[[File:William-Tecumseh-Sherman.jpg|thumb|160px|William Tecumseh Sherman]]
At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said "would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion. This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=U.S. Grant |title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant; Selected Letters |year=1990 |publisher=Library of America |page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsselectedl00gran_0/page/247 247] |isbn=978-0-940450-58-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsselectedl00gran_0/page/247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals [[George Meade]] and Benjamin Butler were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) were to [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|attack the Shenandoah Valley]], General Sherman was to capture Atlanta and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] were to operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]], and Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks was to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Field|title=Petersburg 1864–65: The Longest Siege|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=kLf3Mua-IQwC|page=6}}|year=2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=6|isbn=978-1-4728-0305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|left|These dead soldiers—from [[Richard S. Ewell|Ewell]]'s May 1864 attack at [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]]—delayed Grant's advance on Richmond in the [[Overland Campaign]].]]

=== Grant's Overland Campaign ===
Grant's army set out on the [[Overland Campaign]] intending to draw Lee into a defense of Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.

An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though, unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724–42}}
[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]

=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===
Grant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. vice president and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778–79}}

&lt;/imagemap&gt;
Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=773–76}} Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin–Nashville Campaign]]. Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=812–15}}

Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20 percent of the farms in Georgia in his "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825–30}}

=== The Waterloo of the Confederacy ===
Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called "the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=846–47}}

Initially, Lee did not intend to surrender but planned to regroup at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|village of Appomattox Court House]], where supplies were to be waiting and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded. After [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|an initial battle]], Lee decided that the fight was now hopeless, and surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the [[McLean House (Appomattox, Virginia)|McLean House]].&lt;ref name="appomattox" /&gt; In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]].

On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|was shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Southern sympathizer. Lincoln died early the next morning. Lincoln's vice president, [[Andrew Johnson]], was unharmed as his would-be assassin, [[George Atzerodt]], lost his nerve, so he was immediately sworn in as president. Meanwhile, Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee's surrender reached them.&lt;ref name="surrender" /&gt; On April 26, 1865, the same day [[Boston Corbett]] killed Booth at a tobacco barn, General [[Joseph E.

===Explaining the Union victory===
[[File:Civil war 1861-1865.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Confederate territory losses year by year|alt=A map of the U.S. South showing shrinking territory under rebel control]]
The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for its outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]] are subjects of lingering contention today. The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}

Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=855}} McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.&lt;ref name="confederacy" /&gt;

Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.&lt;ref name="confederacy" /&gt; Lincoln was not a military dictator and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771–72}}

Some scholars argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat.{{sfn|Murray|Bernstein|Knox|1996|p=235}}{{sfn|HeidlerHeidlerColes|2002|p=1207–10}} Civil War historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly: "I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back&amp;nbsp;... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."{{sfn|Ward|1990|p=272}}

A minority view among historians is that the Confederacy lost because, as [[E. Merton Coulter]] put it, "people did not will hard enough and long enough to win."&lt;ref&gt;E. Merton Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America, 1861–1865'' (1950), p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Beringer, Herman Hattaway, Archer Jones and William N. Still Jr, ''Why the South Lost the Civil War'' (1991), ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most historians reject the argument.&lt;ref&gt;see Alan Farmer, [http://www.historytoday.com/alan-farmer/why-was-confederacy-defeated ''History Review'' (2005)], No. 52: 15–20.&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson, after reading thousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism that continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he says most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard.{{sfn|McPherson|1997|pp=169–72}} Historian [[Gary Gallagher]] cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, "The devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired." Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, "yet I see no sign of let-up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out."{{sfn|Gallagher|1999|p=57}}

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.&lt;ref name="WarLeader" /&gt; The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95% effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382–88}}

Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:

{{quote|The North's victory decisively proved the durability of democratic government. Confederate independence, on the other hand, would have established an American model for reactionary politics and race-based repression that would likely have cast an international shadow into the twentieth century and perhaps beyond."&lt;ref&gt;Fergus M. Bordewich, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-cause-of-all-nations-by-don-h-doyle-1423260658 "The World Was Watching: America's Civil War slowly came to be seen as part of a global struggle against oppressive privilege"], ''Wall Street Journal'' (February 7–8, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;}}Scholars have debated what the effects of the war were on political and economic power in the South.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dupont|first1=Brandon|last2=Rosenbloom|first2=Joshua L.|title=The Economic Origins of the Postwar Southern Elite|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=68|pages=119–131|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2017.09.002|year=2018|url=https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/econ_las_pubs/644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing view is that the southern planter elite retained its powerful position in the South.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a 2017 study challenges this, noting that while some Southern elites retained their economic status, the turmoil of the 1860s created greater opportunities for economic mobility in the South than in the North.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The war resulted in at least 1,030,000 casualties (3 percent of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease—and 50,000 civilians.&lt;ref name="StatsWarCost" /&gt; Binghamton University historian J.

Based on 1860 census figures, 8 percent of all white men aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6 percent in the North and 18 percent in the South.{{sfn|Vinovskis|1990|p=7}}&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; About 56,000 soldiers [[American Civil War prison camps|died in prison camps]] during the War.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic" /&gt; An estimated 60,000 men lost limbs in the war.&lt;ref name="NYT TR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Riordan|first=Teresa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/08/business/technology-when-necessity-meets-ingenuity-art-of-restoring-what-s-missing.html|title=When Necessity Meets Ingenuity: Art of Restoring What's Missing|website=The New York Times|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=March 8, 2004|access-date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Union army dead, amounting to 15 percent of the over two million who served, was broken down as follows:&lt;ref name="civilwarhome.com" /&gt;
* 110,070 killed in action (67,000) or died of wounds (43,000).
* 199,790 died of disease (75 percent was due to the war, the remainder would have occurred in civilian life anyway)
* 24,866 died in Confederate prison camps
* 9,058 killed by accidents or drowning
* 15,741 other/unknown deaths
* 359,528 total dead

In addition there were 4,523 deaths in the Navy (2,112 in battle) and 460 in the Marines (148 in battle).&lt;ref name="Official DOD data" /&gt;

Black troops made up 10 percent of the Union death toll, they amounted to 15 percent of disease deaths but less than 3 percent of those killed in battle.&lt;ref name="civilwarhome.com" /&gt; Losses among [[African American]]s were high. In the last year and a half and from all reported casualties, approximately 20 percent of all African Americans enrolled in the military lost their lives during the Civil War. Notably, their mortality rate was significantly higher than white soldiers. While 15.2% of United States Volunteers and just 8.6% of white Regular Army troops died, 20.5% of [[United States Colored Troops]] died.&lt;ref name=Aptheker&gt;Herbert Aptheker, "Negro Casualties in the Civil War", ''The Journal of Negro History'', Vol. 32, No. 1. (January 1947).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|16}}

Confederate records compiled by historian William F. Fox list 74,524 killed and died of wounds and 59,292 died of disease. Including Confederate estimates of battle losses where no records exist would bring the Confederate death toll to 94,000 killed and died of wounds. However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.&lt;ref name="civilwarhome.com" /&gt;

The United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses:&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;

'''Union: 853,838'''
* 110,100 killed in action
* 224,580 disease deaths
* 275,154 wounded in action
* 211,411 captured (including 30,192 who died as POWs)

'''Confederate: 914,660'''
* 94,000 killed in action
* 164,000 disease deaths
* 194,026 wounded in action
* 462,634 captured (including 31,000 who died as POWs)

[[File:Burial of the dead on the Antietam battlefield army.mil-2008-09-10-145638.jpg|thumb|Burying Union dead on the [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] battlefield, 1862]]

While the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. [[Francis Amasa Walker]], superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5% and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.&lt;ref name="recounting"/&gt;

Analyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307–48}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.

Deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Professor James Downs. "Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction". January 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Losses were far higher than during the recent [[Mexican–American War|defeat of Mexico]], which saw roughly thirteen thousand American deaths, including fewer than two thousand killed in battle, between 1846 and 1848. One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Minié ball]]s, and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of [[trench warfare]], a style of fighting that defined much of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Field and Peter Dennis|title=American Civil War Fortifications (2): Land and Field Fortifications|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5QUWAAAAQBAJ|page=4}}|date= 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=4|isbn=978-1-4728-0531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emancipation===

====Slavery as a war issue====
Abolishing slavery was not a Union war goal from the outset, but it quickly became one.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=vii–viii}} Lincoln's initial claims were that preserving the Union was the central goal of the war.{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=74}} In contrast, the South saw itself as fighting to preserve slavery.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=vii–viii}} While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting for slavery, most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]]'s army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], not to abolish slavery.{{sfn|Foner|1981|p=?}} However, as the war dragged on it became clear that slavery was the central factor of the conflict. Lincoln and his cabinet made ending slavery a war goal, which culminated in the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=vii–viii}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lincoln's decision to issue the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] angered both [[Peace Democrats]] ("Copperheads") and [[War Democrats]], but energized most Republicans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;McPherson, pp.&amp;nbsp;506–8.&lt;/ref&gt; By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the [[1862 congressional elections|1862 elections]], but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson. p.&amp;nbsp;686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5&amp;nbsp;million blacks effectively ended in each area when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. The last Confederate slaves were freed on June 19th, 1865, celebrated as the modern holiday of [[Juneteenth]]. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied before the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cathey|first=Libby|date=June 17, 2021|title=Biden signs bill making Juneteenth, marking the end of slavery, a federal holiday|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sign-bill-making-juneteenth-federal-holiday-commemorating/story?id=78335485|access-date=June 17, 2021|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Goldin, "The economics of emancipation."

About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders—until 1865—opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, "If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong." Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=831–37}}}}

During the Civil War, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement and emancipation in the United States was divided. Lincoln's fears of making slavery a war issue were based on a harsh reality: abolition did not enjoy wide support in the west, the territories, and the border states.{{Sfn|Donald|1995|p=417-419}}&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that "to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861. Sentiment among [[German Americans]] was largely anti-slavery especially among [[Forty-Eighters]], resulting in hundreds of thousands of German Americans volunteering to fight for the Union.

At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C. Frémont]] (in Missouri) and [[David Hunter]] (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats. Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, James, in Gabor S. Boritt, ed. ''Lincoln, the War President'', pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; But only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like "our last shriek on the retreat".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen B. Oates|Oates, Stephen B.]], ''Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln laid the groundwork for public support in an open letter published in abolitionist Horace Greeley's newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;"Lincoln Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862".&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862, the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;Pulling, Sr. Anne Francis. "Images of America: Altoona, 2001, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to [[Albert G. Hodges]], Lincoln explained his belief that "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong&amp;nbsp;... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling&amp;nbsp;... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves to fight for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) and Union-controlled regions around New Orleans, Norfolk and elsewhere, were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=SLAVERY in DELAWARE|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/delaware.htm|year=2003|access-date=October 16, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016062740/http://slavenorth.com/delaware.htm| archive-date= October 16, 2007| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the proclamation did not enjoy universal support. It caused much unrest in the Western states, where racist sentiments led to a great fear of abolition. There was some concern that the proclamation would lead to the secession of Western states, and prompted the stationing of Union troops in Illinois in case of rebellion.{{Sfn|Donald|1995|p=417-419}}

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;" James McPherson, The War that Never Goes Away"&lt;/ref&gt; The Emancipation Proclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France.{{sfn|Asante|Mazama|2004|p=82}} By late 1864, Lincoln was playing a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made emancipation universal and permanent.{{sfn|Holzer|Gabbard|2007|p=172–174}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|Northern teachers traveled into the South to provide education and training for the newly freed population.]]
The war had utterly devastated the South, and posed serious questions of how the South would be re-integrated to the Union. The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South. All accumulated investment Confederate bonds were forfeit; most banks and railroads were bankrupt. The income per person in the South dropped to less than 40 percent of that of the North, a condition that lasted until well into the 20th century. Southern influence in the U.S. federal government, previously considered, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; Reconstruction began during the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and it continued until 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Hans L. Trefousse, ''Historical Dictionary of Reconstruction'' (Greenwood, 1991) covers all the main events and leaders.&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the war's aftermath, the most important of which were the three "[[Reconstruction Amendments]]" to the Constitution: the 13th outlawing slavery (1865), the 14th guaranteeing citizenship to slaves (1868) and the 15th ensuring voting rights to slaves (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a "[[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]]" for the ex-Confederate states, and to permanently end slavery—and prevent semi-slavery status.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner's ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) is a brief survey.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865 when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. [[Radical Republicans]] demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. In 1872 the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|"Liberal Republicans"]] argued that the war goals had been achieved and that Reconstruction should end. They ran a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The [[Compromise of 1877]] closed with a national consensus that the Civil War had finally ended.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction'' (2nd edn 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature; the [[Jim Crow]] period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was ushered in.

The Civil War would have a huge impact on American politics in the years to come. Many veterans on both sides were subsequently elected to political office, including five U. S. Presidents: General Ulysses Grant, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], [[James Garfield]], [[Benjamin Harrison]], and [[William McKinley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/presidents-who-were-civil-war-veterans.html | title=Presidents Who Were Civil War Veterans |website=Essential Civil War Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil War is one of the central events in American collective memory. There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war.&lt;ref name="controversy" /&gt; The last theme includes moral evaluations of [[racism]] and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an "[[Empire of Liberty]]" influencing the world.&lt;ref name="american83" /&gt;

Professional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and who write for the general public, rather than the scholarly community. [[Bruce Catton]] and [[Shelby Foote]] are among the best-known writers.{{sfn|Woodworth|1996|p=208}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cushman|first=Stephen|title=Belligerent Muse: Five Northern Writers and How They Shaped Our Understanding of the Civil War|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=95l6BAAAQBAJ|page=5}}|year=2014|pages=5–6|isbn=978-1-4696-1878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practically every major figure in the war, both North and South, has had a serious biographical study.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Ritter and Jon L. Wakelyn, eds., ''Leaders of the American Civil War: A Biographical and Historiographical Dictionary'' (1998) Provide short biographies and valuable historiographical summaries&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lost Cause===
{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}
The memory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|"Lost Cause"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.&lt;ref name="confederacy84" /&gt; Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly "a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|"virulent racism" of the 19th century]], sacrificing black American progress to white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause "a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter" in every instance.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lost Cause myth was formalized by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard, whose ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) spawned "Beardian historiography". The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. Though this interpretation was abandoned by the Beards in the 1940s, and by historians generally by the 1950s, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|orig-year=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=978-0-307-80960-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battlefield preservation===
[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]

The first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga. Soldiers began erecting markers on battlefields beginning with the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but the oldest surviving monument is the [[Hazen Brigade Monument]] near [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], built in the summer of 1863 by soldiers in Union Col. [[William Babcock Hazen|William B. Hazen's]] brigade to mark the spot where they buried their dead following the [[Battle of Stones River]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.murfreesboropost.com/community/hazen-s-monument-a-rare-historic-treasure/article_0498c498-c95b-5569-8d8a-ce0830be17d7.html] Murfreesboro Post, April 27, 2007, "Hazen's Monument a rare, historic treasure." Accessed May 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, the United States government established five Civil War battlefield parks under the jurisdiction of the War Department, beginning with the creation of the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]] in Tennessee and the [[Antietam National Battlefield]] in Maryland in 1890. The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899. In 1933, these five parks and other national monuments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy B. Smith, "The Golden Age of Battlefield Preservation" (2008; The University of Tennessee Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief among modern efforts to preserve Civil War sites has been the [[American Battlefield Trust]], with more than 130 battlefields in 24 states.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Zeller, "Fighting the Second Civil War: A History of Battlefield Preservation and the Emergence of the Civil War Trust," (2017: Knox Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.battlefields.org/preserve/saved-land] [[American Battlefield Trust]] "Saved Land" page.

The American Civil War has been commemorated in many capacities ranging from the reenactment of battles to statues and memorial halls erected, to films being produced, to stamps and coins with Civil War themes being issued, all of which helped to shape public memory. This varied advent occurred in greater proportions on the 100th and 150th anniversary.
&lt;ref name="gallagher" /&gt;
[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such film classics as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), and more recently ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' (2012). [[Ken Burns]]'s PBS television series ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990) is especially well remembered, though criticized for its historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Debate over Ken Burns Civil War doc continues over decades {{!}} The Spokesman-Review|url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/nov/04/debate-over-ken-burns-civil-war-doc-continues-over/|website=spokesman.com|access-date=2020-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why We Need a New Civil War Documentary|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-we-need-new-civil-war-documentary-180971996/|last=Merritt|first=Keri Leigh|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological significance===
Numerous technological innovations during the Civil War had a great impact on 19th-century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest examples of an "[[Industrial warfare|industrial war]]", in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Thomas and David Kennedy: ''The American Pageant'', p. 434. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; New inventions, such as the [[Military railways|train]] and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], delivered soldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dome |first=Steam |year=1974 |title=A Civil War Iron Clad Car |journal=Railroad History |volume=130 |issue=Spring 1974 |pages=51–53 |publisher=The Railway &amp; Locomotive Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rattle Plum, ''The Military Telegraph During the Civil War in the United States'', ed.
