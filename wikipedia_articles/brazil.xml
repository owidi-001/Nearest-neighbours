Brazil was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|numerous tribal nations]] prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], who claimed the area for the [[Portuguese Empire]]. It remained a [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony]] until 1808 when the capital of the empire was [[Transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil|transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. In 1822, Brazil [[Independence of Brazil|achieved independence]] with the creation of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]]. The country [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|became a presidential republic]] in 1889 following a military [[coup d'état]]. An authoritarian [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military junta]] came to power [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|in 1964]] and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil|constitution]], formulated in 1988, defines it as a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[federal republic]].&lt;ref name="Constituição"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Federal Constitution |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |year=1988 |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm |language=pt |access-date=3 June 2008 }} {{cite web |title=Brazilian Federal Constitution |publisher=v-brazil.com |year=2007 |url=http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html |quote=Unofficial translate |access-date=3 June 2008 |archive-date=28 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928070506/http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Brazil}}
The word "Brazil" likely comes from the Portuguese word for [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]], a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.&lt;ref name="Fausto1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Fausto|title=A Concise History of Brazil|url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00faus|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56526-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00faus/page/9 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese, brazilwood is called ''pau-brasil'', with the word ''brasil'' commonly given the etymology "red like an [[ember]]", formed from ''brasa'' ("ember") and the suffix ''-il'' (from ''-iculum'' or ''-ilium'').&lt;ref name="Vincent2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon S.

Around the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Robert M. |title=The History of Brazil |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-4039-6255-3 |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The indigenous population of Brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g. the [[Tupí people|Tupis]], [[Guaraní people|Guaranis]], [[Gê peoples|Gês]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]]). The Tupí people were subdivided into the [[Tupiniquim people|Tupiniquins]] and [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambás]], and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups.{{sfnp|Levine|2003|p=31}}

The land now called Brazil was claimed for the [[Portuguese Empire]] on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name="Boxer, p. 98"&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the [[Tupi–Guarani]] family, and fought among themselves.&lt;ref name="Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;100"&gt;Boxer, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, [[colonization]] effectively began in 1534, when King [[John III of Portugal|John&amp;nbsp;III of Portugal]] divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy Colonies of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27"&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[continental Portugal]], causing [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent João]], in the name of [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]], to move the royal court from [[Lisbon]] to [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213"&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local [[stock exchange]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Marta Barcellos &amp; Simone Azevedo; ''Histórias do Mercado de Capitais no Brasil'' ("Financial Markets' Histories in Brazil") (Portuguese) Campus Elsevier 2011 {{ISBN|85-352-3994-4}} Introduction (by Ney Carvalho), Intro. p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Banco do Brasil|National Bank]], additionally ending the Portuguese [[monopoly]] on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil to other nations.

With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a [[colony]]. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], thus creating a [[pluricontinental]] transatlantic monarchic state.&lt;ref name="Mosher2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey C.

Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the [[Portuguese Cortes]], guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;117–19&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|declaring the country's independence from Portugal]] on 7 September 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;150–153&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first [[Emperor of Brazil]], with the royal title of Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro&amp;nbsp;I]], resulting in the foundation of the [[Empire of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianna, p.&amp;nbsp;418&lt;/ref&gt;

These emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent [[nation state]].{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 2, 2.1 to 2.3}} This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the [[Praieira revolt]] in [[Pernambuco]], was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the [[Dom Pedro II#Early coronation|premature coronation of Pedro II]] in 1841.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999}}

During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery.

Little by little, [[Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil#1st Republican period (1889–1930)|a cycle of general instability]] sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]], supported by most of the military, successfully led the [[Revolution of 1930]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine; Robert M. &amp; Crocitti; John J. ''The Brazil Reader: History, Culture, Politics'', Duke University Press 1999, IV – The Vargas Era&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Benjamin / Haynes, Kate ''A History of Latin America; Volume 2'', Waldsworth Cengage Learning 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;356–57&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their own supporters.&lt;ref&gt;McCann; Frank D.

In the 1930s, three failed attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred. The first was the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in 1932, led by the [[São Paulo (state)|Paulista]] [[oligarchy]]. The second was a [[Brazilian uprising of 1935|Communist uprising]] in November 1935, and the last one a ''putsch'' attempt by [[Brazilian Integralism|local fascists]] in May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;E.

The 1937 ''coup d'état'' resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election, formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] era, which was noted for government brutality and censorship of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, Richard ''Getulio Vargas of Brazil, 1883–1954'' C.

Foreign policy during the Vargas years was marked by the antecedents{{clarify|date=September 2019}} and [[World War II]].

With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy "reinstated" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2004, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Roett; Riordan ''Brazil: Politics in a Patrimonial Society'', GreenWood Publishing Group 1999, pp. 106–08 {{ISBN|0-275-95899-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keen &amp; Haynes 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;361–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Several brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the [[Opposition (politics)|political opposition]] that allowed him to govern without major crises.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–203&lt;/ref&gt; The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;204&lt;/ref&gt; but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]], inaugurated in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubitschek's successor, [[Jânio Quadros]], resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt; His vice-president, [[João Goulart]], assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|deposed in April 1964]] by a coup that resulted in a [[Brazilian military government|military regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;397&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime was intended to be transitory&lt;ref&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp. 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the [[AI-5|Fifth Institutional Act]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="Gaspari p.35"&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA395 395], last paragraph}}&lt;ref&gt;Richard Young, Odile Cisneros "Historical Dictionary of Latin American Literature and Theater" Scare Crow Press 2011, p. 224, 2nd § [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0ZyleoLY5UC&amp;pg=PA224 View on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; inside and outside the country through the infamous "[[Operation Condor]]".&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Burgorgue-Larsen &amp; Amaya Úbeda de Torres "The Inter-American Court of Human Rights: Case Law and Commentary" Oxford University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-19-958878-7}} p. 299 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fQpnBsRWNlYC&amp;pg=PA299 View on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA396 396]}} Despite its brutality, like other [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]], due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA395 395–97]}}

Slowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Burns 1993, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals [[Ernesto Geisel]] and [[Golbery do Couto e Silva]].{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 6 "The military government and the transition to democracy (1964–1984)"}} With the enactment of the [[Amnesty law#Brazil|Amnesty Law]] in 1979, Brazil began a slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999}}

Civilians returned to power in 1985 when [[José Sarney]] assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and [[hyperinflation]] he inherited from the military regime.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989|election in 1989]] of the almost-unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Fernando Collor]], subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;465, 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful [[Plano Real]],&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;311.&lt;/ref&gt; that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Epilogue}}&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;482.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso won the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1994|1994 election]], and [[Brazilian presidential election, 1998|again in 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Operation Car Wash]], the [[Federal Police of Brazil]] has since acted on the deviations and corruption of the PT and allied parties at that time.

The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.&lt;ref name="CIA Geo" /&gt; According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: [[Desert climate|desert]], [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial]], [[tropical climate|tropical]], [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]], [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[Humid subtropical climate|subtropical]]. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|equatorial rainforests]] in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to [[temperate coniferous forest]]s in the south and [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savannas]] in central Brazil.&lt;ref name="BBC Weather"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazil |website=Country Guide |publisher=BBC Weather |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT005220 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208034235/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT005220 |archive-date=8 February 2011 |access-date=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many regions have starkly different [[microclimate]]s.&lt;ref name="Encarta 9"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Natural Regions |encyclopedia=Encarta |publisher=MSN |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554342_2/Brazil.html |access-date=11 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029034943/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554342_2/Brazil.html |archive-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead}} {{Dubious|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- tertiary source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web |title=Temperature in Brazil |publisher=Brazil Travel |url=http://www.v-brazil.com/information/geography/temperature-graphs.html |access-date=11 June 2008 |archive-date=12 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612200827/http://www.v-brazil.com/information/geography/temperature-graphs.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real [[dry season]], but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.&lt;ref name="BBC Weather" /&gt; Temperatures average {{convert|25|°C}},&lt;ref name="BT" /&gt; with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.&lt;ref name="Encarta 9" /&gt;

Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.&lt;ref name="Encarta 9" /&gt; This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.&lt;ref name="BBC Weather" /&gt; In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.&lt;ref name="Rain" /&gt;

The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than {{convert|800|mm|1}} of rain,&lt;ref name="Rain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpatsa.embrapa.br/servicos/dadosmet/cem-anual.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820215606/http://www.cpatsa.embrapa.br/servicos/dadosmet/cem-anual.html|archive-date=20 August 2007|title=Annual averages of Mandacaru Agro-meteorological station|author=Embrapa|language=pt|access-date=21 October 2008|author-link=Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/sa/sa19.htm|title=CPD: South America, Site SA19, Caatinga of North-eastern Brazil, Brazil|publisher=Botany.si.edu|access-date=29 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606055642/http://botany.si.edu/projects/cpd/sa/sa19.htm|archive-date=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought.&lt;ref name="Encarta 9" /&gt; Brazil's 1877–78 ''[[Grande Seca]]'' (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/6/07-1331_article.htm "Drought, Smallpox, and Emergence of Leishmania braziliensis in Northeastern Brazil"].

FAO.&lt;/ref&gt;

South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of São Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year.&lt;ref name="BBC Weather" /&gt; The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding {{convert|18|°C|1}};&lt;ref name="BT" /&gt; winter frosts and [[Snow in Brazil|snowfall]] are not rare in the highest areas.&lt;ref name="BBC Weather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta 9" /&gt;

However, in 2019, when the [[Bolsonaro government]] came to power, the rate of [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest]] increased sharply threatening to reach a tipping point after it the forest will collapse, having severe consequences for the world (see [[Tipping points in the climate system]]) and possibly complicating the trade agreement with the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watts |first1=Jonathan |title=Amazon deforestation accelerating towards unrecoverable 'tipping point' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/amazonian-rainforest-near-unrecoverable-tipping-point |access-date=28 July 2019 |agency=The Guardian |date=25 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2008 GreenPeace article, the natural heritage of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, oil and gas extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, [[Climate change in Brazil|climate change]], fire, and invasive species.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; In many areas of the country, the natural environment is threatened by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Under threat |publisher=Greenpeace |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/forests/south-america/under-threat/ |access-date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape.&lt;ref name="Encarta 11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amazon destruction: six football fields a minute |publisher=Greenpeace |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/amazon-destruction |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405192352/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/amazon-destruction |archive-date=5 April 2008 |access-date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial [[Belo Monte Dam|Belo Monte]] hydroelectric dam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8492577.stm "Brazil grants environmental licence for Belo Monte dam"].

The form of government is a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Federation|federative]] [[republic]], with a [[presidential system]].&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is [[Jair Bolsonaro]]. The previous president, [[Michel Temer]], replaced [[Dilma Rousseff]] after her [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|impeachment]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/americas/brazil-rousseff-impeachment-vote/index.html|title=Brazil's Senate ousts Rousseff in impeachment vote|first1=Catherine E. |last1=Shoichet |first2=Euan |last2=McKirdy|website=CNN|access-date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President appoints the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]], who assist in government.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. Brazil is a [[democracy]], according to the [[Democracy Index]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Democracy Index 2010 |url=http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf|website=eiu.com|access-date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The [[federation]] is set on five fundamental principles:&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; The executive and legislative are organized [[Separation of powers|independently in all three spheres of government]], while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres.

All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100724/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |archive-date=25 July 2011 |title=Embassy of Brazil&amp;nbsp;– Ottawa |quote=Political Institutions&amp;nbsp;– The Executive |access-date=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/brazil_government.html |title=City Mayors |quote=Brazil federal, state and local government |access-date=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The country has more than 40 active political parties, and only one of them defines itself as a right-wing party ([[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]]), with a clear political imbalance. The country has several far-left parties like [[Socialism and Liberty Party|PSOL]], [[Workers' Cause Party|PCO]], [[United Socialist Workers' Party|PSTU]], [[Brazilian Communist Party|PCB]], [[Communist Party of Brazil|PC do B]], left parties like [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]], [[Brazilian Socialist Party|PSB]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|PDT]], [[Green Party (Brazil)|PV]], [[Sustainability Network|Rede]] and [[Solidariedade]] and center-left like [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]], [[Democrats (Brazil)|DEM]], [[Party of National Mobilization|PMN]] and [[Cidadania]]. Ten parties declare themselves as the center: [[Brazilian Democratic Movement|MDB]], [[Liberal Party (Brazil, 2006)|PL]], [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011)|PSD]], [[Christian Labour Party|PTC]], [[Christian Democracy (Brazil)|DC]], [[Republican Party of the Social Order|PROS]], [[Avante (political party)|Avante]], [[Patriota]], [[Podemos (Brazil)|Podemos]] and [[Party of the Brazilian Woman|PMB]]. Five parties declare themselves as center-right: [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|PTB]], [[Progressistas]], [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|PSC]], [[Brazilian Labour Renewal Party|PRTB]] and [[Republicans (Brazil)|Republicanos]]. The only party that claims to be purely liberal, without further consideration, is [[New Party (Brazil)|Novo]]. When asked about their ideological spectrum, Brazilian parties tend to give obtuse and non-conclusive answers on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/republica/apenas-um-partido-se-define-como-de-direita-no-brasil-esquerda-tem-sete/|title=Apenas um partido se define como de direita no Brasil; Esquerda tem sete|website=Gazeta do Povo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of Brazil|Law enforcement in Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}

[[File:Supremo Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|[[Supreme Federal Court of Brazil]] serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country]]

Brazilian law is based on the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Retrieved 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

The legal system is based on the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]], promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.&lt;ref&gt;José Afonso da Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'' (Malheiros, 2004; {{ISBN|85-7420-559-1}}), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|04}}, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'', p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|leis orgânicas}}), which act in a similar way to constitutions.&lt;ref name="DeffentiBarral2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fabiano Deffenti|author2=Welber Oliveira Barral|title=Introduction to Brazilian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ba2J5eD8wYC&amp;pg=PA20|access-date=6 June 2013|year=2011|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=978-90-411-2506-4|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]] allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Court]].

This system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making.

Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; The [[National Public Security Force]] also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/defesa-e-seguranca/2012/05/ordem-publica-e-prioridade-da-forca-nacional-de-seguranca |title=Ordem pública é prioridade da Força Nacional de Segurança |publisher=Portal Brasil |date=29 April 2012 |access-date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|highest rates of homicide of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,brasil-tem-maior-numero-absoluto-de-homicidios-do-mundo,1604827|title=Brasil tem maior número absoluto de homicídios do mundo|publisher=[[O Estado de S.

While in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in [[Alagoas]] it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/uma-pessoa-e-assassinada-a-cada-dez-minutos-no-brasil|title=Os estados com mais homicídios no Brasil|magazine=[[Exame]]|date=11 November 2014|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only [[China]] and the [[United States]]), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2014/06/1465527-brasil-passa-a-russia-e-tem-a-terceira-maior-populacao-carceraria-do-mundo.shtml|title=Brasil passa a Rússia e tem a terceira maior população carcerária do mundo|newspaper=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about 200,000 accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2014/01/brasil-tem-hoje-deficit-de-200-mil-vagas-no-sistema-prisional.html|title=Brasil tem hoje deficit de 200 mil vagas no sistema prisional|publisher=G1|date=15 January 2014|access-date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Regions of Brazil}}
Brazil is a federation composed of 26 [[Federated state|states]], one [[federal district]], and the 5570 [[Municipality|municipalities]].&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt;

The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]]. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called ''[[comarca]]'' (county).

Natural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of [[ecotourism]] with leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as cultural tourism. Among the most popular destinations are the [[Amazon Rainforest]], beaches and dunes in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]], the [[Pantanal]] in the [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Region]], beaches at [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], cultural tourism in [[Minas Gerais]] and business trips to [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="Palhares2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guilherme Lohmann Palhares|title=Tourism in Brazil: Environment, Management and Segments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O91SVF9nH8gC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-67432-4|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the 2015 [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index]] (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level, third in the [[Americas]], after Canada and United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 |publisher=World Economic Forum |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/TT15/WEF_Global_Travel&amp;Tourism_Report_2015.pdf |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TTCI2013"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TT_Competitiveness_Report_2013.pdf|editor1=Jennifer Blanke |editor2=Thea Chiesa |year = 2013 |title = Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013 |publisher = [[World Economic Forum]], Geneva, Switzerland|access-date=14 April 2013}} ''See Table 4, pp. 18–19 and Country/Economy Profile: Brazil, pp. 116–17.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's main competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many [[World Heritage site]]s. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation. Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.&lt;ref name="TTCI2013" /&gt;

Public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area.

Brazil's private institutions tend to be more exclusive and offer better quality education, so many high-income families send their children there. The result is a segregated educational system that reflects extreme income disparities and reinforces social inequality.

The architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Pedro Cabral]] discovered Brazil in 1500. [[Portuguese colonial architecture]] was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Hue, Jorge de Souza (1999). Uma visão da arquitectura colonial no Brasil [A vision of Colonial Architecture in Brazil] (in Portuguese). Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, Charles Ralph (1962). The Golden Age of Brazil, 1695–1750: Growing Pains of a Colonial Society. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century during the time of the [[Empire of Brazil]], Brazil followed European trends and adopted [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with [[Modernist architecture]].

The colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonize Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside. During 19th century Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture. In the 1950s the [[modernist architecture]] was introduced when [[Brasilia]] was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] idealized and built government buildings, churches and civic buildings in the modernist style.&lt;ref name="Guimaraens"&gt;Guimaraens, Cêça de.

The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European and African elements.&lt;ref name="FonsecaWeiner1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Duduka Da Fonseca|author2=Bob Weiner|title=Brazilian Rhythms for Drumset|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuZQUm_hhygC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1991|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=978-0-7692-0987-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European.

[[Brazilian literature]] dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as [[Pêro Vaz de Caminha]], filled with descriptions of [[fauna]], [[flora]] and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA360 360]}}

Brazil produced significant works in [[Romanticism]] – novelists like [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]] and [[José de Alencar]] wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the [[Indianism (arts)|Indigenist]] novels ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[Ubirajara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100730/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/literature.html "Brazilian Literature: An Introduction"].

The Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the [[Belle Époque]]. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as ''Rio the Magnificent'' were made in [[Rio de Janeiro]] to promote tourism in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio the Magnificent (1932)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Q1kITY168|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films ''[[Limite]]'' (1931) and ''[[Ganga Bruta]]'' (1933), the latter being produced by [[Adhemar Gonzaga]] through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/movies/10cinema.html |title=Brazil's Best, Restored and Ready for a 21st-Century Audience |last1=Larry |first1=Rohter |last2= |first2= |date=9 November 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |access-date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1941 unfinished film ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by [[Orson Welles]]; it was originally produced as part of the United States' [[Good Neighbor Policy]] during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.

During the 1960s, the [[Cinema Novo]] movement rose to prominence with directors such as [[Glauber Rocha]], [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]], [[Paulo Cesar Saraceni]] and [[Arnaldo Jabor]]. Rocha's films ''[[Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol]]'' (1964) and ''[[Terra em Transe]]'' (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tose|first1=Juliano|title=Editorial|url=http://www.contracampo.com.br/27/frames.htm|website=Contracampo – revista de cinema|publisher=Revista Contracampo|access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as ''[[O Quatrilho]]'' ([[Fábio Barreto]], 1995), ''[[O Que É Isso, Companheiro?]]'' ([[Bruno Barreto]], 1997) and ''[[Central Station (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' ([[Walter Salles]], 1998), all of which were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], the latter receiving a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] nomination for [[Fernanda Montenegro]].

The theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century. in the 17th and 18th centuries the first dramatists who appeared on the scene of European derivation was for court or private performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brasilescola.uol.com.br/biografia/padre-anchieta.htm Padre Anchieta] ''Brasil Escola''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, dramatic theater gained importance and thickness, whose first representative was [[Luis Carlos Martins Pena]] (1813–1848), capable of describing contemporary reality. Always in this period the comedy of costume and comic production was imposed. Significant, also in the nineteenth century, was also the playwright [[Antônio Gonçalves Dias]].&lt;ref name=teatro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/theater.html |title=Brazilian Theatre: An Introduction |publisher=Ambasciata brasiliana a Ottawa |language=english |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205061026/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/theater.html |archive-date= 5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous operas and orchestras. The Brazilian conductor [[Antônio Carlos Gomes]] became internationally known with operas like ''[[Il Guarany]]''. At the end of the 19th century orchestrated dramaturgias became very popular and were accompanied with songs of famous artists like the conductress [[Chiquinha Gonzaga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.seed.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=196 O Teatro no Brasil] ''Secretaria da Educação do Paraná''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the early 20th century there was the presence of theaters, entrepreneurs and actor companies, but paradoxically the quality of the products staggered, and only in 1940 the Brazilian theater received a boost of renewal thanks to the action of Paschoal Carlos Magno and his student's theater, the comedians group and the Italian actors [[Adolfo Celi]], Ruggero Jacobbi and Aldo Calvo, founders of the ''Teatro Brasileiro de Comedia''. From the 1960s it was attended by a theater dedicated to social and religious issues and to the flourishing of schools of dramatic art. The most prominent authors at this stage were [[Jorge Andrade]] and [[Ariano Suassuna]].&lt;ref name=teatro /&gt;
