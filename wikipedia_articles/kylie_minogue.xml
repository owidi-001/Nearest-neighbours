'''Kylie Ann Minogue''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|OBE|sep=,}} ({{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|n|oʊ|ɡ}}; born 28 May 1968), [[Mononymous person|also known simply as]] '''Kylie''', is an Australian singer, songwriter and actress. Minogue is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time, having sold over 70&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music and fashion, for which she is referred to by the European press as the “[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]” and a style icon. [[List of awards and nominations received by Kylie Minogue|Her accolades]] include a [[Grammy Award]], three [[Brit Awards]] and 17 [[ARIA Music Awards]].

Born and raised in [[Melbourne]], Minogue achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', playing tomboy mechanic [[Charlene Robinson]]. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. By the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including "[[I Should Be So Lucky]]", "[[The Loco-Motion]]", "[[Hand on Your Heart]]", and "[[Better the Devil You Know]]". Taking more creative control over her music, Minogue signed with [[Deconstruction Records]] in 1993 and released ''[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Kylie Minogue]]'' (1994) and ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997), both of which received positive reviews. She returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'', including the number-one hits "[[Spinning Around]]" and "[[On a Night Like This]]". The follow-up, ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Two of its singles, "[[Love at First Sight (Kylie Minogue song)|Love at First Sight]]" and "[[In Your Eyes (Kylie Minogue song)|In Your Eyes]]", became hits but its lead single, "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units. 

Minogue continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as "[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]", "[[2 Hearts (Kylie Minogue song)|2 Hearts]]", "[[All the Lovers]]", "[[Santa Baby#Kylie Minogue version|Santa Baby]]", "[[Timebomb (Kylie Minogue song)|Timebomb]]" and "[[Dancing (Kylie Minogue song)|Dancing]]". With her 2020 album ''[[Disco (Kylie Minogue album)|Disco]]'', she became the first female artist to have a chart-topping album in the UK for five consecutive decades. Minogue made her film debut in ''[[The Delinquents (1989 film)|The Delinquents]]'' (1989) and portrayed [[Cammy]] in ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' (1994). She has also appeared in the films ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), ''[[Jack &amp; Diane (film)|Jack &amp; Diane]]'', ''[[Holy Motors]]'' (2012) and ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]'' (2015). In 2014, she appeared as a judge on the third series of ''[[The Voice UK (series 3)|The Voice UK]]'' and ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]''. Her other ventures include product endorsements, children's books, fashion, and charitable work.

Minogue was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2008 New Year Honours]] for services to music. She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2005, while Minogue was on tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Health Science]] (D.H.Sc.) degree by [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in 2011 for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. At the 2011 [[ARIA Music Awards]], she was inducted by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]].

She would often stay at home reading, sewing and learning to play violin and piano.&lt;ref name="exclaim"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/kylie_minogue_is_the_soccer_of_pop_artists_huge_worldwide_never_caught_on_in_north_america| date=5 June 2018| access-date=18 August 2019|title=Kylie Minogue Is the Soccer of Pop Artists: Huge Worldwide, Never Caught on in North America|work=[[Exclaim!]]| author=Gormely, Ian|url-status=live|archive-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614222529/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/kylie_minogue_is_the_soccer_of_pop_artists_huge_worldwide_never_caught_on_in_north_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they moved to [[Surrey Hills, Victoria]], Minogue went on to [[Camberwell High School]].&lt;ref name="Goddessofthemoment"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lister|first=David|title=Kylie Minogue: Goddess of the moment|work=The Independent|location=London|date=23 February 2002|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/kylie-minogue-goddess-of-the-moment-661725.html|access-date=26 July 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202225506/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/kylie-minogue-goddess-of-the-moment-661725.html|archive-date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her schooling years, Minogue found it difficult to make friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2014|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She got her [[Higher School Certificate (Victoria)|HSC]] (graduated high school) with subjects including Arts and Graphics and English.&lt;ref name="pg36"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2014|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minogue described herself as being of "average intelligence" and "quite modest" during her high school years.&lt;ref name="pg36" /&gt; Growing up, she and her sister Dannii took singing and dancing lessons.&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt;

A ten-year-old Minogue accompanied Dannii to a hearing arranged by the sisters' aunt, Suzette, and, while producers found Dannii too young, [[Alan Hardy (producer)|Alan Hardy]] gave Minogue a minor role in soap opera ''[[The Sullivans]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name=survivor/&gt;&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt; She also appeared in another small role in ''[[Skyways (TV series)|Skyways]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt; In 1985, she was cast in one of the lead roles in ''[[The Henderson Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wearring|first=Miles|title=Kylie's life on screen|work=Herald Sun|date=28 May 2008|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,23769961-10388,00.html|access-date=26 July 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528210458/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0%2C26278%2C23769961-10388%2C00.html|archive-date=28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minogue took time off school to film ''The Henderson Kids'' and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt that she needed the independence to make it into the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name="pg32"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2014|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming, co-star [[Nadine Garner]] labelled Minogue "fragile" after producers yelled at her for forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set.&lt;ref name="pg32" /&gt; Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after producer Alan Hardy felt the need for her character to be "written off".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2014|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, Hardy stated that removing her from the showing "turned out to be the best thing for her".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2014|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a [[demo (music)|demo tape]] for the producers of weekly music programme ''[[Young Talent Time]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Adams|first=Cameron|title=Kylie Minogue&amp;nbsp;– 20 years on|work=Herald Sun|date=2 August 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22171653-2902,00.html|access-date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured Dannii as a regular performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minogue gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast.

''Neighbours'' achieved popularity in the UK, and a [[story arc]] that created a romance between [[Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell|her character]] and the character played by [[Jason Donovan]] culminated in a [[Episode 523 (Neighbours)|wedding episode]] in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20&amp;nbsp;million British viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/facts/since1981/?year=1988&amp;view=top10|title=BARB Since 1981|website=barb.co.uk|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|access-date=21 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312095633/http://www.barb.co.uk/facts/since1981/?year=1988&amp;view=top10|archive-date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Simpson|first=Aislinn|title=Kylie Minogue celebrates 40th birthday|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=27 May 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2036175/Kylie-Minogue-celebrates-40th-birthday.html|access-date=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minogue became the first person to win four [[Logie Award]]s in one year and was the youngest recipient of the "[[Gold Logie]]" as the country's "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Logies|website=televisionau.com|publisher=TelevisionAU|url=http://www.televisionau.com/logies.htm|access-date=26 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minogue's second album, ''[[Enjoy Yourself (Kylie Minogue album)|Enjoy Yourself]]'' was released in October 1989.

Minogue's fourth album, ''[[Let's Get to It]]'' was released in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart.

She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right."&lt;ref name="Shuker164"&gt;Shuker, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Her first ''[[Greatest Hits (Kylie Minogue album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album was released in August 1992.

By 1997, Minogue was in a relationship with French photographer [[Stéphane Sednaoui]], who encouraged her to develop her creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Minogue, pp. 107–112&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by a mutual appreciation of Japanese culture, they created a visual combination of "[[geisha]] and [[manga]] superheroine" for the photographs taken for Minogue's sixth album ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' and the video for "[[German Bold Italic]]", Minogue's collaboration with [[Towa Tei]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Minogue, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; She drew inspiration from the music of artists such as [[Shirley Manson]] and [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], [[Björk]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[U2]], and Japanese pop musicians such as [[Pizzicato Five]] and Towa Tei.&lt;ref name=iprincess&gt;Baker and Minogue, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured collaborations with musicians including [[James Dean Bradfield]] and [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] of the [[Manic Street Preachers]].

==Artistry==
Minogue explained that she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: "I first got into pop music in 1981, I'd say. It was all about [[Prince (singer)|Prince]], [[Adam Ant#Adam and the Ants|Adam + the Ants]], that whole [[New Romantic]] period. Prior to that, it was the [[Jackson 5]], [[Donna Summer]], and my dad's records – [[The Rolling Stones|the Stones]] and [[The Beatles|Beatles]]."&lt;ref name="ThinWhiteDame"/&gt; She would also listen to the records of [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[ABBA]].&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=pjoye/&gt; Minogue claimed that she "wanted to be" Newton-John while growing up.&lt;ref name=pjoye/&gt; Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or [[Madonna]]&amp;nbsp;... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her."&lt;ref name="Goddessofthemoment" /&gt; Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a "product of the [[Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman]] Hit Factory".&lt;ref name="kylie88"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pjoye/&gt; Musician [[Nick Cave]], who worked with Minogue in some occasions, was a major influence on her artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flick|first=Larry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ug4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Minogue Makes Mature Turn on Deconstruction Set|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=110|issue=14|page=18|issn=0006-2510|date=4 April 1998|access-date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''The Guardian'': "He's definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways."&lt;ref name=hann&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/kylie-minogue-on-how-ageing-breast-cancer-and-nick-cave-all-influenced-her-greatest-hits| date=26 April 2018| access-date=18 August 2019| title=Kylie on how ageing, breast cancer and Nick Cave all influenced her greatest hits| work=The Guardian| author=Hann, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her career, Minogue's work was also influenced by [[Cathy Dennis]], [[D Mob]],&lt;ref name=hann/&gt; [[Scritti Politti]],&lt;ref name="ThinWhiteDame"/&gt; [[Björk]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], [[U2]] and [[Pizzicato Five]],&lt;ref name=iprincess/&gt; among others.

Chris True from ''Allmusic'', reviewed her debut ''[[Kylie (album)|Kylie]]'' and found her music "standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum", however he stated that she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist.&lt;ref name="kylie88"/&gt; He said of her third album ''[[Rhythm of Love (Kylie Minogue album)|Rhythm of Love]]'', from the early 1990s, "The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rhythm-of-love-mw0000457557|title=Rhythm of Love – Kylie Minogue|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her third studio album, "She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one." Chris True stated that during her relationship with [[Michael Hutchence]], "her shedding of the near-virginal façade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music."&lt;ref name="allmusicbio"&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093 Kylie Minogue &gt;&gt; Overview]. AllMusic.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Minogue's work on her sixth studio album, ''[[Impossible Princess]]'', her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Minogue, Hodder and Stoughton, 2002. p 111.&lt;/ref&gt; She had written lyrics before, but called them "safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that".&lt;ref&gt;John Walsh. "Lucky in Luck". ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Cinquemani from ''Slant Magazine'' said that the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's ''[[Ray of Light]]''. He said that she took inspiration from "both the Brit-pop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s", saying that "Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks".&lt;ref name="slant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|date=19 November 2003|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/kylie-minogue-impossible-princess/371|title=Kylie Minogue: Impossible Princess|journal=Slant Magazine|access-date=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next effort, ''Light Years'' is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic's Chris True calling it "Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s".&lt;ref name=lightall/&gt; True stated that her eighth album, ''Fever'', "combines the disco-diva comeback of ''Light Years'' with simple dance rhythms".&lt;ref name=albumreviewallmusic&gt;{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Fever – Kylie Minogue|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/fever-mw0000658212|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ninth album, ''Body Language'' was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a "successful" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance.&lt;ref name="allmusicbio" /&gt; Incorporating styles of [[dance music]] with funk, disco and R&amp;B,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/7262|title=Kylie – Body Language|date=12 September 2005|work=NME|access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the album was listed on ''[[Q magazine|Q]]''{{'}}s "Best Albums of 2003".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlists.html#2003|title=Q magazine Recordings Of The Year – 2003|publisher=Rocklist.net. music.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics said Minogue's tenth record ''X'' did not feature enough "consistency" and Chris True called the tracks "cold, calculated dance-pop numbers."&lt;ref name=xall&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/x-mw0000784634|title=X – Kylie Minogue|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Sendra of AllMusic said that her eleventh album ''Aphrodite'' "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" and "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit."

Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not "paid her dues" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="Shuker164" /&gt; Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, "If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go."&lt;ref name="ThinWhiteDame" /&gt;

In 1993, [[Baz Luhrmann]] introduced Minogue to photographer [[Bert Stern]], notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Minogue, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' to the more traditionally sophisticated ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]] has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream [[popular culture|pop culture]] in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Minogue, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected.&lt;ref name="Copley"&gt;Copley, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Her progression from the wholesome "[[girl next door]]" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans.&lt;ref name="Copley" /&gt; Her "Spinning Around" video led to some media outlets referring to her as "SexKylie", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos.&lt;ref name="Copley" /&gt; In September 2002, she was ranked 27 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Sexiest Artists list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-tops-the-list-as-vh1-counts-down-musics-100-sexiest-artists-in-five-hour-five-night-special-premiering-september-23-27-at-1000-pm-etpt-75840192.html|title=Madonna Tops the List as VH1 Counts Down Music's '100 Sexiest Artists'|agency=PR Newswire|date=18 September 2002|access-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606015929/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-tops-the-list-as-vh1-counts-down-musics-100-sexiest-artists-in-five-hour-five-night-special-premiering-september-23-27-at-1000-pm-etpt-75840192.html|archive-date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All-Time by ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Hottest Women of All-Time|url=https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/g19547274/hottest-women-all-time/?slide=38|work=[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]|access-date=15 August 2019|date=22 November 2013|archive-date=15 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815142627/https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/g19547274/hottest-women-all-time/?slide=38|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Baker described her status as a [[sex symbol]] as a "double edged sword", observing that "we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.

Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out. She is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it. She is the gay shorthand for joy."&lt;ref name="KylieandMadonna" /&gt; Kathy McCabe for ''The Telegraph'' noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion,&lt;ref name="KylieandMadonna"&gt;{{Cite news|last=McCabe|first=Kathy|title=Kylie and Madonna strut a similar stage, but are they poles apart?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 November 2007|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/kylie-or-madonna-whos-queen/story-fna7dq6e-1111114952055|access-date=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but concluded, "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet&amp;nbsp;... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force."&lt;ref name="KylieandMadonna" /&gt; Minogue has said of Madonna, "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done",&lt;ref name="lalala58" /&gt; and "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that."&lt;ref name="KylieandMadonna" /&gt;

In March 2010, Minogue was declared by researchers as the "most powerful celebrity in Britain". The study examined how marketers identify celebrity and brand partnerships. Mark Husak, head of Millward Brown's UK media practice, said: "Kylie is widely accepted as an adopted Brit.

She said that she felt "very touched" to have such an "appreciative crowd", and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland and Ellis, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Ellis, Bryony Sutherland.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Ernest Macias said that, by combining "a panache for fabulous fashion" with "her unequivocal disco-pop sound", Minogue  "established herself as a timeless icon."&lt;ref name=ew1/&gt; Paula Joye of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' wrote that "Minogue's fusion of fashion and music has made a huge contribution to the style ''[[zeitgeist]]''."&lt;ref name=pjoye&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/kylie-pop-culture-princess-20111129-1o3vh.html| date=30 November 2011| access-date=15 August 2019| title=Kylie: Pop Culture Princess| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| author=Joye, Paula|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815142956/https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/kylie-pop-culture-princess-20111129-1o3vh.html?js-chunk-not-found-refresh=true|archive-date=15 August 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona MacDonald, from fashion magazine ''Madison'', acknowledged Minogue as "one of the handful of singers recognised around the world by her first name alone.

Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 36 in May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the [[Glastonbury Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Minogue's cancer shock ends tour|publisher=CNN|date=17 May 2005|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/05/17/kylie.cancer/index.html|access-date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where then Prime Minister [[John Howard]] issued a statement of support.&lt;ref name="CNNtreatment"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Kylie begins cancer treatment|date=19 May 2005|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/05/18/kylie.surgery/|publisher=CNN|access-date=9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier [[Steve Bracks]] warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bracks warns paparazzi to back off|work=The Age|location=Australia|date=18 May 2005|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/People/Bracks-warns-paparazzi/2005/05/18/1116361596970.html|access-date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Attard|first=Monica|title=Peter Carrette and Peter Blunden on Kylie Minogue and the media|publisher=ABC Sunday Profile|date=22 May 2005|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1373289.htm|access-date=21 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011101209/http://abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1373289.htm |archive-date=11 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Aiken|first=Kirsten|title=Media Coverage of Kylie Minogue: Circulation or Compassion?|publisher=ABC Radio|date=22 May 2005|url=http://www.abc.net.au/correspondents/content/2004/s1373909.htm|access-date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minogue underwent surgery on 21 May 2005 at Cabrini Hospital in [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]] and commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment soon after.&lt;ref name="CNNtreatment" /&gt; After the surgery, the disease "had no recurrence".&lt;ref name=chemo/&gt; On 8 July 2005, she made her first public appearance after surgery when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.
