'''George Orson Welles''' (May 6, 1915&amp;nbsp;– October 10, 1985) was an American director, actor, screenwriter, and producer who is remembered for his innovative work in radio, theatre, and film. He is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt;

While in his 20s, Welles directed high-profile stage productions for the [[Federal Theatre Project]], including an [[Voodoo Macbeth|adaptation of ''Macbeth'']] with an entirely African American cast and the political musical ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''. In 1937, he and [[John Houseman]] founded the [[Mercury Theatre]], an independent [[repertory theatre]] company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941, including ''[[Caesar (Mercury Theatre)|Caesar]]'' (1937), a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.

In 1938, his radio anthology series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' gave Welles the platform to find international fame as the director and narrator of [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|a radio adaptation]] of [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', which caused some listeners to believe that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was in fact occurring. Although reports of panic were mostly false and overstated,&lt;ref name="McFarland"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |date=2001 |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeWm-zM3NEoC&amp;q=Little%20Green%20Men%2C%20Meowing%20Nuns%20and%20Head-Hunting%20Panics%3A&amp;pg=PA219 |location=Jefferson, N.C. |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-0997-6 |access-date=March 30, 2010 |archive-date=December 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205164458/https://books.google.com/books?id=GeWm-zM3NEoC&amp;q=Little+Green+Men%2C+Meowing+Nuns+and+Head-Hunting+Panics%3A&amp;pg=PA219 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; they rocketed Welles to notoriety.

His first film was ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), which is consistently ranked as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], and which he [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|co-wrote]], produced, directed and starred in as [[Charles Foster Kane]]. Welles released twelve other features, the most acclaimed of which include ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947), ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958), ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'' (1962), ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' (1965), and ''[[F for Fake]]'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1998/06/list-o-mania-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-american-movies/|title=List-o-Mania, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love American Movies|date=June 25, 1998|publisher=Jonathan Rosenbaum|access-date=May 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428194825/http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1998/06/list-o-mania-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-american-movies/|archive-date=April 28, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-chimes-at-midnight-1965 |title=Great Movie: Chimes at Midnight |date=June 4, 2006 |publisher=Roger Ebert |access-date=May 9, 2015 |archive-date=January 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104041851/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-chimes-at-midnight-1965 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; His distinctive directorial style featured layered and [[nonlinear narrative]] forms, uses of [[lighting]] such as [[chiaroscuro]], unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, [[deep focus]] shots, and [[long take]]s.

Welles was an outsider to the [[studio system]] and struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the [[major film studio]]s in [[Hollywood]] and later in life with a variety of independent financiers across [[Europe]], where he spent most of his career. Many of his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. Some, like ''Touch of Evil'', have been painstakingly re-edited from his notes. With a development spanning almost 50 years, Welles's final film, ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'', was released in 2018.

Welles had three marriages, including one with [[Rita Hayworth]], and three children. Known for his [[baritone]] voice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Orson Welles |last=Christley |first=Jaime N. |magazine=[[Senses of Cinema]] |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/welles/ |url-status=live |year=2003 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914000935/http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/welles/ |archive-date=September 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles performed extensively across theatre, radio, and film. He was a lifelong [[magic (illusion)|magician]], noted for presenting [[The Mercury Wonder Show|troop variety shows]] in the war years. In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two [[British Film Institute]] polls among directors and critics.&lt;ref name="BFI Directors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors-directors.html |title=Sight &amp; Sound &amp;#124;Top Ten Poll 2002&amp;nbsp;– The Directors' Top Ten Directors |publisher=BFI |date=September 5, 2006 |access-date=December 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013231353/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors-directors.html |archive-date=October 13, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI Critics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics-directors.html |title=Sight &amp; Sound &amp;#124;Top Ten Poll 2002&amp;nbsp;– The Critics' Top Ten Directors |publisher=BFI |date=September 5, 2006 |access-date=December 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181654/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics-directors.html |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he was included in the list of the 50 greatest Hollywood actors of all time by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/best-actors-hollywoods-golden-age/orson-welles0/|title=The 50 greatest actors from Hollywood's Golden Age|date=June 25, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=November 9, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-date=November 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109191410/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/best-actors-hollywoods-golden-age/orson-welles0/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), and the two of them sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs. Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said goodbye, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them: George Orson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Fred C.|title=George Ade, Warmhearted Satirist|date=1947|publisher=The Bobs-Merrill Company|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=209|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=203979&amp;apid=119503 |title=Orson Welles Biography |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=May 9, 2015 |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510185307/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=203979 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, a pianist, played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to support her son and herself; the oldest Welles boy, "Dickie", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties.

After his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing music. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony in the village of [[Wyoming, New York|Wyoming]] in the [[Finger Lakes Region]] of [[New York State]], established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|8}} There, he played and became friends with the children of the [[Aga Khan III|Aga Khan]], including the 12-year-old [[Prince Aly Khan]]. Then, in what Welles later described as "a hectic period" in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school&lt;ref name="Tarbox"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tarbox |first=Todd |date=2013 |title=Orson Welles and Roger Hill: A Friendship in Three Acts |location=Albany, Georgia |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=978-1-59393-260-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|133}} before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned, they settled in a hotel in [[Grand Detour, Illinois]], that was owned by his father. When the hotel burned down, Welles and his father took to the road again.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|9}}

"During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom," wrote biographer Frank Brady.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|9}}

"In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know," said Roger Hill, who became Welles's teacher and lifelong friend.&lt;ref name="Leaming" /&gt;{{Rp|24}}

Welles briefly attended public school in Madison, Wisconsin, enrolled in the fourth grade.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|9}} On September 15, 1926, he entered the [[Todd Seminary for Boys]],&lt;ref name="Tarbox" /&gt;{{Rp|3|date=April 2014}} an expensive independent school in [[Woodstock, Illinois]], that his older brother, Richard Ives Welles, had attended ten years before until he was expelled for misbehavior.&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;{{Rp|48}} At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an ''ad hoc'' educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NseAVbjgYOMC&amp;q=orson%20welles%20todd%20school&amp;pg=PP11|title=Orson Welles on Shakespeare: The W.P.A. and Mercury Theatre Playscripts|last=France|first=Richard|date=April 15, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97993-6|language=en|access-date=October 8, 2020|archive-date=December 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205164456/https://books.google.com/books?id=NseAVbjgYOMC&amp;q=orson+welles+todd+school&amp;pg=PP11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences," wrote critic Richard France. "He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theatre, the school's own radio station was at his disposal."&lt;ref name="France" /&gt;{{Rp|27}} Welles's first radio experience was on the Todd station, where he performed an adaptation of ''Sherlock Holmes'' that was written by him.&lt;ref name="Heyer"&gt;Heyer, Paul, ''The Medium and the Magician: Orson Welles, the Radio Years 1934–1952''.

On December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had announced to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking. As a result, Orson felt guilty because he believed his father had drunk himself to death because of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orson Welles: A Biography|last = Leaming|first = Barbara|publisher = Viking Adult|year = 1985|isbn = 978-0-670-52895-0|url = https://archive.org/details/orsonwellesbiogr00leam}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian.

== Early career (1931–1935) ==
[[File:Welles-Ireland-1931.jpg|thumb|After graduating, 16-year-old Welles embarked on a painting and sketching tour of Ireland and the [[Aran Islands]], traveling by donkey cart (1931)]]
After his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the [[Gate Theatre]] in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of the Gate, [[Hilton Edwards]], later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave.&lt;ref&gt;[[Micheál Mac Liammóir|Mac Liammóir, Micheál]], ''All For Hecuba: An Irish Theatrical Biography''. London: Methuen &amp; Co.

He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932, Welles performed in [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''The Circle'' at Dublin's [[Abbey Theatre]] and traveled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|327–330}}

Welles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that became immensely successful, first entitled ''Everybody's Shakespeare'' and subsequently, ''The Mercury Shakespeare''. Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the ''Everybody's Shakespeare'' series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-writes-the-introduction-to-everybodys-shakespeare-in-the-north-atlantic/ |title=Orson Welles writes the Introduction to Everybody's Shakespeare in the North Atlantic |date=September 23, 2007 |website=Wellesnet |access-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408210018/http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-writes-the-introduction-to-everybodys-shakespeare-in-the-north-atlantic/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Roger and Hortense Hill invited Welles to a party in Chicago, where Welles met [[Thornton Wilder]]. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet [[Alexander Woollcott]] in New York in order that he be introduced to [[Katharine Cornell]], who was assembling a [[repertory theatre]] company. Cornell's husband, director [[Guthrie McClintic]], immediately put Welles under contract and cast him in three plays.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|46–49|date=April 2014}} ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' and ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'' toured in repertory for 36 weeks beginning in November 1933, with the first of more than 200 performances taking place in Buffalo, New York.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|330–331}}

At the old firehouse in Woodstock, he also shot his first film, an eight-minute short titled, ''[[The Hearts of Age]]''.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|330–331}}

Part of the [[Works Progress Administration]], the [[Federal Theatre Project]] (1935–39) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. It was created as a [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935|relief measure]] to employ artists, writers, directors and theatre workers. Under national director [[Hallie Flanagan]] it was shaped into a truly national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |author-link=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Houseman]], director of the [[Federal Theatre Project#African-American theatre|Negro Theatre Unit]] in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed — "I was so employed I forgot how to sleep" — Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. "Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money ''into'' a Washington project," Welles said.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|11–13}}

The Federal Theatre Project was the ideal environment in which Welles could develop his art.

Outside the scope of the Federal Theatre Project,&lt;ref name="France" /&gt;{{Rp|100}} American composer [[Aaron Copland]] chose Welles to direct ''[[The Second Hurricane]]'' (1937), an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby.

Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects, the show's premiere at the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]] was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to [[New Century Theatre|the Venice]], 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theatre Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, ''The Cradle Will Rock'' began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.

Breaking with the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, ''[[The American Mercury]]''.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;[[Frank Brady (writer)|Brady, Frank]], ''Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1989 {{ISBN|0-684-18982-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|119–120}} Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as [[Joseph Cotten]], [[George Coulouris]], [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], [[Arlene Francis]], [[Martin Gabel]], [[John Hoyt]], [[Norman Lloyd]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Stefan Schnabel]] and [[Hiram Sherman]].

"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater," Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. "When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest."&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eatdrinkfilms.com/2014/07/17/orson-welles-world-and-were-just-living-in-it-a-conversation-with-norman-lloyd/ |title=Orson Welles' World, and We're Just Living in It: A Conversation with Norman Lloyd |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |date=2014 |website=EatDrinkFilms.com |access-date=August 6, 2015 |archive-date=September 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919113159/http://eatdrinkfilms.com/2014/07/17/orson-welles-world-and-were-just-living-in-it-a-conversation-with-norman-lloyd/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with ''[[Caesar (Mercury Theatre)|Caesar]]'', Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''—streamlined into an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as "so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear."&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;{{Rp|108}} The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red.

"By making himself the center of the storytelling process, Welles fostered the impression of self-adulation that was to haunt his career to his dying day", wrote critic [[Andrew Sarris]].

After the theatrical successes of the [[Mercury Theatre]], [[CBS Radio]] invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, initially titled ''First Person Singular'', with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''.&lt;ref name="Museum of Broadcasting" /&gt;{{Rp|12}} The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by [[Bernard Herrmann]].

The Mercury Theatre's [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds'']] by [[H. G. Wells]] October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question.&lt;ref name="McFarland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Getting It Wrong: Ten of the Greatest Misreported Stories in American Journalism |url=https://archive.org/details/gettingitwrongte0000camp |url-access=registration |last=Campbell |first=W.

[[File:Orson-Welles-CBS-Radio-Studio-1938.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' became ''The Campbell Playhouse'' in December 1938]]

Welles's growing fame drew [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air,'' which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship) was picked up by [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell Soup]] and renamed ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnoutloud.com/Catalog/Literature/-/The-Mercury-Theatre-on-the-Air/16905 |title=Learn Out Loud |publisher=Learn Out Loud |access-date=March 30, 2010 |archive-date=February 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211083357/http://www.learnoutloud.com/Catalog/Literature/-/The-Mercury-Theatre-on-the-Air/16905 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and ''The Campbell Playhouse'' began five days later.

Welles began commuting from California to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of ''The Campbell Playhouse'' after signing a film contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|353|date=January 2014}}

After 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|221–226}}

[[RKO Radio Pictures]] president [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George Schaefer]] eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to a filmmaker, much less to one who was untried.

RKO rejected Welles's first two movie proposals, but agreed on the third offer – ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Welles co-wrote, produced and directed the film, and performed the lead role.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;McMahon, Thomas, "Orson Welles", ''Authors &amp; Artists for Young Adults: Vol. 40''. Michigan: Gale Research, 2001 {{ISBN|0787646733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles conceived the project with screenwriter [[Herman J.

After agreeing on the storyline and character, Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of [[John Houseman]]. Welles wrote his own draft,&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|54}} then drastically condensed and rearranged both versions and added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|54}}

Welles's project attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001" /&gt; For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. Filming ''Citizen Kane'' took ten weeks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001" /&gt;

Hearst's newspapers barred all reference to ''Citizen Kane'' and exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community to force RKO to shelve the film.&lt;ref name="Carringer 1985" /&gt;{{Rp|111}} RKO chief [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George Schaefer]] received a cash offer from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s [[Louis B. Mayer]] and other major studio executives if he would destroy the negative and existing prints of the film.&lt;ref name="Carringer 1985" /&gt;{{Rp|112}}

While waiting for ''Citizen Kane'' to be released, Welles produced and directed the original Broadway production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'', a drama written by [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] based on Wright's [[Native Son|novel]]. Starring [[Canada Lee]], the show ran March 24 – June 28, 1941, at the [[St. James Theatre]]. The Mercury Production was the last time Welles and Houseman worked together.&lt;ref name="Bret Wood" /&gt;{{Rp|12}}

''Citizen Kane'' was given a limited release and the film received overwhelming critical praise. It was voted the best picture of 1941 by the [[National Board of Review]] and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]]. The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations but won only for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]], shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. ''Variety'' reported that block voting by screen extras deprived ''Citizen Kane'' of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.&lt;ref name="Carringer 1985" /&gt;{{Rp|117}}

The delay in the film's release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office. After it ran its course theatrically, ''Citizen Kane'' was retired to the vault in 1942. In postwar France, however, the film's reputation grew after it was seen for the first time in 1946.&lt;ref name="Carringer 1985" /&gt;{{Rp|117–118}} In the United States, it began to be re-evaluated after it began to appear on television in 1956.

In late November 1941, Welles was appointed as a [[Goodwill Ambassador|goodwill ambassador]] to [[Latin America]] by [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs|U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures.&lt;ref name="Benamou"&gt;Benamou, Catherine L., ''It's All True: Orson Welles's Pan-American Odyssey''.

The OCIAA sponsored cultural tours to Latin America and appointed goodwill ambassadors including [[George Balanchine]] and the [[American Ballet]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Walt Disney]], [[John Ford]] and [[Rita Hayworth]]. Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it "not unlikely" that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles's acceptance of Whitney's request was "a logical and patently patriotic choice".&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|245–247}}

In addition to working on his ill-fated film project ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'', Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Richard, "It's Not ''Quite'' All True". ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', Volume 39 Number 4, Autumn 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|192}} He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. audiences that [[Getúlio Vargas|President Vargas]] was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|247–249, 328}} Welles worked for more than half a year with no compensation.&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|41, 328}}&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;{{Rp|189}}

Welles's own expectations for the film were modest. "''It's All True'' was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to," he later said. "It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one."&lt;ref name="Leaming" /&gt;{{Rp|253}}

==== ''It's All True'' ====
{{Main|It's All True (film)}}

In July 1941, Welles conceived ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' as an [[Anthology|omnibus]] film mixing documentary and [[docufiction]]&lt;ref name="Leaming" /&gt;{{Rp|221}}&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|27}} in a project that emphasized the [[dignity of labor]] and celebrated the cultural and ethnic diversity of North America.

Mercury Productions purchased the stories for two other segments—"My Friend Bonito" and "The Captain's Chair"—from documentary filmmaker [[Robert J. Flaherty]].&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|33, 326}} Adapted by [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]] and [[John Fante]], "My Friend Bonito" was the only segment of the original ''It's All True'' to go into production.&lt;ref name="South American Cinema" /&gt;{{Rp|109|date=April 2014}} Filming took place in Mexico September–December 1941, with Norman Foster directing under Welles's supervision.&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|311}}

In December 1941, the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] asked Welles to make a film in Brazil that would showcase the [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]] in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;{{Rp|65}} With filming of "My Friend Bonito" about two-thirds complete, Welles decided he could shift the geography of ''It's All True'' and incorporate Flaherty's story into an omnibus film about Latin America—supporting the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration's [[Good Neighbor policy]], which Welles strongly advocated.&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|41, 246}} In this revised concept, "The Story of Jazz" was replaced by the story of [[samba]], a musical form with a comparable history and one that came to fascinate Welles. He also decided to do a ripped-from-the-headlines episode about the epic voyage of four poor Brazilian fishermen, the [[Jangada|jangadeiros]], who had become national heroes. Welles later said this was the most valuable story.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|158–159}}&lt;ref name="Bret Wood" /&gt;{{Rp|15}}

Required to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and finish his acting scenes in ''Journey into Fear''. He ended his lucrative [[The Orson Welles Show (radio series)|CBS radio show]]&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;{{Rp|189}} February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of ''Ambersons'' in Miami with editor [[Robert Wise]].&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|369–370}} Welles recorded the film's narration the night before he left for South America: "I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio—and the end of civilization as we know it."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|115}}

Welles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio on February 8, 1942.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|369–370}} At the time it did not seem that Welles's other film projects would be disrupted, but as film historian Catherine L. Benamou wrote, "the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading—in 'zigs' and 'zags,' rather than in a straight line—to Welles's loss of complete directorial control over both ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and ''It's All True'', the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of ''It's All True''.&lt;ref name="Benamou" /&gt;{{Rp|46}}

In 1942 RKO Pictures underwent major changes under new management. Nelson Rockefeller, the primary backer of the Brazil project, left its board of directors, and Welles's principal sponsor at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. RKO took control of ''Ambersons'' and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles's attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.&lt;ref name="AFI Ambersons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Vincent L.

On October 12, 1942, ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'' presented Welles's radio play, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea'', an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.

"It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas," wrote broadcasting historian [[Erik Barnouw]]. "Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area. The Axis, trying to stir Latin America against Anglo-America, had constantly emphasized the differences between the two. It became the job of American radio to emphasize their common experience and essential unity."&lt;ref name="Barnouw"&gt;[[Erik Barnouw|Barnouw, Erik]] (ed.), ''Radio Drama in Action: 25 Plays of a Changing World''.

''Admiral of the Ocean Sea'', also known as ''Columbus Day'', begins with the words, "Hello Americans"—the title Welles would choose for his own series five weeks later.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|373}}

''[[Hello Americans]]'', a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, ''It's All True''.&lt;ref&gt;Hickerson, Jay, ''The Ultimate History of Network Radio Programming and Guide to All Circulating Shows''. Hamden, Connecticut, second edition December 1992, page 303&lt;/ref&gt; The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, ''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'' (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]-[[Vega Aircraft Corporation|Vega]] Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in [[World War II]]. Welles's shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.&lt;ref name="Museum of Broadcasting" /&gt;{{Rp|64}}

Throughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including ''[[Command Performance (radio series)|Command Performance]]'', ''G.I. Journal'', ''[[Mail Call (radio program)|Mail Call]]'', ''Nazi Eyes on Canada'', ''Stage Door Canteen'' and ''Treasury Star Parade''.

{{Main|The Mercury Wonder Show}}
In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'', ''[[Hello Americans]]'') that Orson Welles created for [[CBS Radio|CBS]] to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part [[circus]] and part [[magic (illusion)|magic show]]. He offered his services as magician and director,&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;Charvet, David, "Orson Welles and The Mercury Wonder Show". ''[[Magic (American magazine)|Magic, An Independent Magazine for Magicians]]'', Volume 2 Number 12, August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}} and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend [[Joseph Cotten]]: ''[[The Mercury Wonder Show]] for Service Men''. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay.&lt;ref name="Genii" /&gt;{{Rp|26}} The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt;

The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's oft-changing [[Selective Service System|draft status]] in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F—unfit for military service—for a variety of medical reasons. "I felt guilty about the war," Welles told biographer [[Barbara Leaming]]. "I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status."&lt;ref name="Leaming Hayworth"&gt;Leaming, Barbara, ''If This Was Happiness: A Biography of Rita Hayworth''. New York: Viking, 1989 {{ISBN|0-670-81978-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|86}} He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;{{Rp|66–67}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://framework.latimes.com/2011/09/28/orson-welles-rejected-by-army/ |title=Orson Welles Rejected by Army (May 6, 1943) |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]], September 28, 2011 |access-date=August 24, 2014 |date=September 28, 2011 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170629/http://framework.latimes.com/2011/09/28/orson-welles-rejected-by-army/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=6392 |title=70 years ago: Orson Welles's patriotism, military service made headlines |publisher=Wellesnet, May 3, 2013 |access-date=August 24, 2014 |date=May 3, 2013 |archive-date=December 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205164505/https://www.wellesnet.com/70-years-ago-orson-welles%e2%80%99-patriotism-military-service-made-headlines/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welles campaigned ardently for Roosevelt in 1944.

In the fall of 1945 Welles began work on ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'' (1946), a [[film noir]] drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic [[New England]] town.

=== ''Around the World'' ===
{{Main|Around the World (musical)}}
In the summer of 1946, Welles moved to New York to direct the Broadway musical ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]'', a stage adaptation of the [[Jules Verne]] novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' with a book by Welles and music by [[Cole Porter]]. Producer [[Mike Todd]], who would later produce the successful [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|1956 film adaptation]], pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]] to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/around-the-world-musical-opened-on-broadway-70-years-ago/ |title=Around the World Musical Opened on Broadway 70 years ago |date=May 27, 2016 |website=Wellesnet |access-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-date=October 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004141900/http://www.wellesnet.com/around-the-world-musical-opened-on-broadway-70-years-ago/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio (1946) ===
In 1946, Welles began two new radio series—''[[The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air]]'' for CBS, and ''[[Orson Welles Commentaries]]'' for ABC. While ''Mercury Summer Theatre'' featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his ''Around the World'' stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. ''Commentaries'' was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his ''New York Post'' column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the [[NAACP]] brought to his attention the case of [[Isaac Woodard]]. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-sought-justice-for-isaac-woodard-70-years-ago/ |title=Orson Welles Sought Justice for Issaac Woodard 70 years ago |last=Teal |first=Mike |date=July 28, 2016 |website=Wellesnet.com |access-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043226/http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-sought-justice-for-isaac-woodard-70-years-ago/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last broadcast of ''Orson Welles Commentaries'' on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles's own radio shows.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|401}}

=== ''The Lady from Shanghai'' ===
{{Main|The Lady from Shanghai}}
The film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]'' was ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', filmed in 1947 for [[Columbia Pictures]]. Intended as a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.
[[File:Lady from Shanghai trailer welles.JPG|thumb|left|''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947)]]
Cohn disliked Welles's [[rough cut]], particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's [[Brechtian]] use of irony and [[black comedy]], especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors (the use of mirrors being a recurrent motif of Welles') has since become a touchstone of [[film noir]]. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.

Although ''The Lady from Shanghai'' was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later, where it is now often regarded as a classic of film noir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-lady-from-shanghai/Film?oid=2552830|title=The Lady From Shanghai|last=Kehr|first=Dave|website=Chicago Reader|language=en|access-date=March 16, 2018|archive-date=March 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316151825/https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-lady-from-shanghai/Film?oid=2552830|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic, followed by greater American acceptance, befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film ''Monsieur Verdoux'', originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.

=== ''Macbeth'' ===
{{Main|Macbeth (1948 film)}}
Prior to 1948, Welles convinced [[Republic Pictures]] to let him direct a [[Macbeth (1948 film)|low-budget version]] of ''[[Macbeth]]'', which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from [[B-movie]] resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a [[collage]] technique and recasting ''Macbeth'' as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the [[Weird Sisters]], who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-''Kane'' Hollywood productions, ''Macbeth'' is stylistically closest to ''Citizen Kane'' in its long takes and deep focus photography.

Republic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''{{'}}s comment that Welles's film "doth foully slaughter Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orson Welles doth foully slaughter Shakespeare in a dialect version of his "Tragedy of Macbeth" — or so sayeth LIFE magazine|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=729|work=Wellesnet|access-date=September 1, 2011|date=June 19, 2009|archive-date=January 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107192608/http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=729|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter [[Richard Wilson (producer)|Richard Wilson]] reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. ''Macbeth'' had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]], who hailed the film's "crude, irreverent power" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting "the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tony|title=Macbeth|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/cteq/macbeth-2/|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|access-date=September 1, 2011|date=February 6, 2006|archive-date=January 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114135546/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/cteq/macbeth-2/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe (1948–1956) ==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}
In Italy he starred as [[Cagliostro]] in the 1948 film ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]''. His co-star, [[Akim Tamiroff]], impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.

The following year, Welles starred as [[Harry Lime]] in [[Carol Reed]]'s ''[[The Third Man]]'', alongside [[Joseph Cotten]], his friend and co-star from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', with a script by [[Graham Greene]] and a memorable score by [[Anton Karas]].

A few years later, British radio producer [[Harry Alan Towers]] would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series ''[[The Adventures of Harry Lime]]''.

Welles appeared as [[Cesare Borgia]] in the 1949 Italian film ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'', with [[Tyrone Power]] and Mercury Theatre alumnus [[Everett Sloane]], and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (again with Tyrone Power).

=== ''Othello'' ===
{{Main|Othello (1951 film)}}
[[File:Othello-Welles-Cloutier.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles and [[Suzanne Cloutier]] in ''[[Othello (1951 film)|Othello]]'' (1951)]]

During this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play ''[[Othello]]''. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on ''[[Othello (1951 film)|Othello]]'', filming on location in [[Italy]] and [[Morocco]]. The film featured Welles's friends, [[Micheál Mac Liammóir]] as [[Iago]] and [[Hilton Edwards]] as [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]]'s father [[Brabantio]]. [[Suzanne Cloutier]] starred as Desdemona and [[The Campbell Playhouse (TV series)|Campbell Playhouse]] alumnus [[Robert Coote]] appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.

Filming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir ''Put Money in Thy Purse''. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a dropout of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored ''Othello'' in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]]'s original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.

In 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the ''Harry Lime'' radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, ''[[The Black Museum]]'', which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in ''[[Trent's Last Case (1952 film)|Trent's Last Case]]'', based on the novel by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]]. In 1953, the [[BBC]] hired Welles to read an hour of selections from [[Walt Whitman]]'s epic poem ''[[Song of Myself]]''. Towers hired Welles again, to play [[Professor Moriarty]] in the radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', starring [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]].

Welles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]'' presentation of ''[[King Lear (1953 TV drama)|King Lear]]'', broadcast live on [[CBS]] October 18, 1953. Directed by [[Peter Brook]], the production costarred [[Natasha Parry]], [[Beatrice Straight]] and [[Arnold Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40866/king-lear/ DVD Talk review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803081939/https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40866/king-lear/ |date=August 3, 2020 }} February 9, 2010 (Retrieved December 29, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of ''[[Three Cases of Murder]]'', co-starring [[Alan Badel]]. [[Herbert Wilcox]] cast Welles as the antagonist in ''[[Trouble in the Glen]]'' opposite [[Margaret Lockwood]], [[Forrest Tucker]] and [[Victor McLaglen]]. Old friend [[John Huston]] cast him as Father Mapple in his [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|1956 film adaptation]] of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', starring [[Gregory Peck]].

=== ''Mr. Arkadin'' ===
{{Main|Mr. Arkadin}}
[[File:Orson Welles.jpg|thumb|175px|upright|Welles in Madrid during filming of ''Mr. Arkadin'' in 1954]]
Welles's next turn as director was the film ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'' (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, [[Louis Dolivet]]. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars [[Robert Arden]], who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, [[Paola Mori]], whose voice was dubbed by actress [[Billie Whitelaw]]; and guest stars [[Akim Tamiroff]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Katina Paxinou]] and [[Mischa Auer]]. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually, five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled ''Confidential Report''. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the [[Munich Film Museum]] oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.

=== Television projects ===
In 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was ''[[Orson Welles' Sketch Book]]'', a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of ''It's All True'' and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was ''[[Around the World with Orson Welles]]'', a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as [[Vienna]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).

During Episode 3 of ''Sketchbook'', Welles makes a deliberate attack on the abuse of police powers around the world. The episode starts with him telling the story of [[Isaac Woodard]], an [[African-American]] veteran of the South Pacific during [[World War II]] being falsely accused by a bus driver of being drunk and disorderly, who then has a policeman remove the man from the bus. Woodard is not arrested right away, but rather he is beaten into unconsciousness nearly to the point of death and when he finally regains consciousness he is permanently blinded. By the time doctors from the US Army located him three weeks later, there was nothing that could be done. Welles assures the audience that he personally saw to it that justice was served to this policeman although he doesn't mention what type of justice was delivered. Welles then goes on to give other examples of police being given more power and authority than is necessary. The title of this episode is "The Police".

In 1956, Welles completed ''[[Portrait of Gina]]''. He left the only copy of it in his room at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]] in Paris. The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered in 1986, after Welles's death.

[[File:Lucille Ball Orson Welles I Love Lucy 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles the magician with Lucille Ball in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (October 15, 1956)]]
In 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theibtaurisblog.com/2012/08/30/orson-welles-and-pan-europeanism-1947-1970/ |title=Orson Welles and pan-Europeanism 1957–1970 |last=Thevoz |first=Seth |publisher=I.B.

He began filming a projected pilot for [[Desilu]], owned by [[Lucille Ball]] and her husband [[Desi Arnaz]], who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was ''[[The Fountain of Youth (film)|The Fountain of Youth]]'', based on a story by [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]]. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958—and won the [[Peabody Award]] for excellence.

Welles guest starred on television shows including ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctva.biz/US/Comedy/Lucy1_ILoveLucy_06_%281956-57%29.htm |title=I Love Lucy (1956–57), 'Lucy Meets Orson Welles' |publisher=The Classic TV Archive |access-date=April 9, 2015 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111153/http://ctva.biz/US/Comedy/Lucy1_ILoveLucy_06_(1956-57).htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On radio, he was narrator of ''Tomorrow'' (October 17, 1956), a [[nuclear holocaust]] drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the [[Federal Civil Defense Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=Tomorrow |title=Tomorrow |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |access-date=September 3, 2014 |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429191604/http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=Tomorrow |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/otr_civildefensewithorsonwelles |title=Tomorrow  |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=September 3, 2014|date=October 17, 1956  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welles's next feature film role was in ''[[Man in the Shadow (American film)|Man in the Shadow]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]] in 1957, starring [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]].

=== ''Touch of Evil'' ===
{{Main|Touch of Evil}}
[[File:Touch-of-Evil-1851-26.jpg|thumb|left|Welles, [[Victor Millan]], [[Joseph Calleia]] and [[Charlton Heston]] in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958)]]
Welles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) [[Charlton Heston]] in the 1958 film ''[[Touch of Evil]]'', based on [[Whit Masterson]]'s novel ''[[Badge of Evil]]''. Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by [[Universal Studios]] at the insistence of Charlton Heston.&lt;ref name="Heston"&gt;[[Charlton Heston|Heston, Charlton]], ''In the Arena: An Autobiography''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, {{ISBN|9780684803944}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|154|date=April 2014}} The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman [[Russell Metty]] (''The Stranger''), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (''Citizen Kane''), and actors [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot.&lt;ref name="Heston" /&gt;{{Rp|175–176|date=April 2014}} Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version—it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.&lt;ref name="Heston" /&gt;{{Rp|175–176|date=April 2014}}

In 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released.

As Universal reworked ''Touch of Evil'', Welles began filming his adaptation of [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in Mexico, starring [[Mischa Auer]] as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as [[Sancho Panza]].

== Return to Europe (1959–1970) ==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Orson Welles - 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|Welles in ''[[Crack in the Mirror]]'' (1960)]]
He continued shooting ''Don Quixote'' in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.
In Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as [[King Saul]] in Richard Pottier's film ''David and Goliath''. In Hong Kong, he co-starred with [[Curt Jürgens]] in [[Lewis Gilbert]]'s film ''[[Ferry to Hong Kong]]''. In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in [[Richard Fleischer]]'s film ''[[Crack in the Mirror]]''. In [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] he starred in [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film ''[[The Tartars]]'' and [[Veljko Bulajić]]'s ''[[Battle of Neretva (film)|Battle of Neretva]]''.

Throughout the 1960s, filming continued on ''Quixote'' on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version of the film he was fully satisfied with and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director [[Jesús Franco]] constructed a film out of the portions of ''Quixote'' left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.

In 1961, Welles directed ''In the Land of Don Quixote'', a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network [[RAI]]. Similar to the ''Around the World with Orson Welles'' series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.

=== ''The Trial'' ===
{{Main|The Trial (1962 film)}}
In 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'', based on [[The Trial|the novel]] by [[Franz Kafka]] and produced by Michael and [[Alexander Salkind]]. The cast included [[Anthony Perkins]] as Josef K, [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Paola Mori]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. While filming exteriors in [[Zagreb]], Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the [[Gare d'Orsay]], at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a "[[Jules Verne]] modernism" and a melancholy sense of "waiting", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm |title=Welles BBC interview |publisher=Wellesnet.com |access-date=March 30, 2010 |archive-date=November 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117061211/http://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; While filming ''The Trial'' Welles met [[Oja Kodar]], who later became his partner and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|428}}

Welles played a film director in ''[[La Ricotta]]'' (1963), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s segment of the ''[[Ro.Go.Pa.G.]]'' movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|516|date=May 2012}} He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', which was completed in 1965.

Filmed in Spain, ''Chimes at Midnight'' was based on Welles's play, ''[[Chimes at Midnight#Five Kings (1939)|Five Kings]]'', in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] (Welles) and his relationship with [[Henry V of England|Prince Hal]] ([[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]]). The cast includes [[John Gielgud]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Fernando Rey]] and [[Margaret Rutherford]]; the film's narration, spoken by [[Ralph Richardson]], is taken from the chronicler [[Raphael Holinshed]].&lt;ref name="Bret Wood" /&gt;{{Rp|249}} Welles held the film in high regard: "It's my favorite picture, yes. If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up."&lt;ref name="Estrin" /&gt;{{Rp|203}}

In 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of ''[[The Immortal Story]]'', by [[Karen Blixen]]. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, [[Roger Coggio]] and [[Norman Eshley]]. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's ''The Heroine'', meant to be a companion piece to ''The Immortal Story'' and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]''—a role for which he won considerable acclaim.

In 1967, Welles began directing ''[[The Deep (1970 film)|The Deep]]'', based on the novel ''[[Dead Calm (novel)|Dead Calm]]'' by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]] and filmed off the shore of [[Yugoslavia]]. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, [[Laurence Harvey]] and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title ''Orson's Bag'', combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with Welles as [[Shylock]]. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving [[The Merchant of Venice (unfinished film)|film]] clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.

In 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The [[Orson Welles Cinema]] remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969, he played a supporting role in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]''. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of ''Don Quixote'' and moved back to America in 1970.

Welles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for [[The Dick Cavett Show|Dick Cavett]], [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Johnny Carson]], [[The Dean Martin Show|Dean Martin]] and [[The Merv Griffin Show|Merv Griffin]].

Welles's primary focus during his final years was ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'', a project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Co-written by Welles and Oja Kodar, it is the story of an aging film director ([[John Huston]]) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Susan Strasberg]], [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]], [[Edmond O'Brien]], [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] was deposed. The legal disputes kept the film in its unfinished state until early 2017 and was finally released in November 2018.

Welles portrayed [[Louis XVIII of France]] in the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy ''[[Start the Revolution Without Me]]'' (1970).

In 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production ''[[Moby Dick—Rehearsed]]''. Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in ''[[Ten Days' Wonder (film)|Ten Days' Wonder]]'', co-starring with [[Anthony Perkins]] and directed by [[Claude Chabrol]] (who reciprocated with a [[bit part]] as himself in ''Other Wind''), based on a detective novel by [[Ellery Queen]]. That same year, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] gave him an [[Academy Honorary Award]] "for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures." Welles pretended to be out of town and sent [[John Huston]] to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. In his speech, Huston criticized the Academy for presenting the award while refusing to support Welles's projects.

In 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of [[Alvin Toffler]]'s 1970 book ''[[Future Shock]]''. Working again for a British producer, Welles played [[Long John Silver]] in director [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]]'s ''[[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1972), an adaptation of the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] novel, which had been the second story broadcast by ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, although his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by [[Robert Rietty]].
[[File:F-for-Fake.jpg|thumb|Orson Welles in ''[[F for Fake]]'' (1974), a [[film essay]] and the last film he completed.]]
In 1973, Welles completed ''[[F for Fake]]'', a personal essay film about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]] and the biographer [[Clifford Irving]]. Based on an existing documentary by [[François Reichenbach]], it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] and [[William Alland]]. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.

Welles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, ''[[Orson Welles' Great Mysteries|Orson Welles's Great Mysteries]]'', during the 1973–74 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|443}} The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of [[Agatha Christie]]'s classic thriller ''[[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|Ten Little Indians]]'' produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included [[Oliver Reed]], [[Elke Sommer]] and [[Herbert Lom]].

In 1975, Welles narrated the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', focusing on [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the [[American Film Institute]] presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director [[John Ford]] and actor [[James Cagney]]). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]''.

In 1976, [[Paramount Television]] purchased the rights for the entire set of [[Rex Stout]]'s [[Nero Wolfe]] stories for Orson Welles.{{efn|Pre-production materials for ''Nero Wolfe'' (1976) are contained in the Orson Welles – Oja Kodar Papers at the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/sclead/umich-scl-welleskodar?byte=6167578;focusrgn=C01;subview=standard;view=reslist |title=Orson Welles – Oja Kodar Papers 1910–1998 (Box 17) |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Special Collections Library |access-date=May 9, 2015 |archive-date=January 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108154420/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/sclead/umich-scl-welleskodar?byte=6167578;focusrgn=C01;subview=standard;view=reslist |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Kleiner"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kleiner |first=Dick |author-link=Dick Kleiner |date=December 30, 1976 |title=No title |newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochte"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lochte |first=Dick |date=January 30, 1977 |title=TV finally tunes in Nero Wolfe |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Liz |author-link=Liz Smith (journalist) |date=March 14, 1977 |title=People |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |quote=Paramount bought the entire set of Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles, who is enjoying a renaissance of popularity in Hollywood and the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but Rex Stout—who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films—turned him down.&lt;ref name="Lochte" /&gt; Paramount planned to begin with an [[Nero Wolfe (film)|ABC-TV movie]] and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series.&lt;ref name="Kleiner" /&gt; [[Frank D.

In 1979, Welles completed his documentary ''[[Filming Othello]]'', which featured Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for ''[[The Orson Welles Show (TV pilot)|The Orson Welles Show]]'' television series, featuring interviews with [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Jim Henson]] and [[Frank Oz]] and guest-starring [[the Muppets]] and [[Angie Dickinson]]. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic ''[[The Secret of Nikola Tesla]]'', and a cameo in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' as Lew Lord.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the [[Paul Masson]] Vineyards,{{efn|Paul Masson's spokesman since 1979, Welles parted company with Paul Masson in 1981, and in 1982 he was replaced by [[John Gielgud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=October 26, 1982 |title=People in the News }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: "We will sell no wine before its time."&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, Gail, "In Advertising, Big Names Mean Big Money."

''[[The New York Times]]'', May 3, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and provided narration on adverts for [[Findus]], though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous [[blooper reel]] of voice recordings, known as the [[Frozen Peas]] reel. He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston. As money ran short, he began directing commercials to make ends meet, including the famous British "Follow the Bear" commercials for [[Hofmeister lager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/21/george-the-bear-hofmeister-lager-facebook-twitter-craft-ale|title=George the bear seeks new followers as Hofmeister lager returns|first=Rob|last=Davies|date=November 21, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 10, 2017|archive-date=March 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325120800/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/21/george-the-bear-hofmeister-lager-facebook-twitter-craft-ale|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Welles hosted the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'', about [[Renaissance]]-era prophet [[Nostradamus]]. In 1982, the BBC broadcast ''The Orson Welles Story'' in the ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as ''With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film''. Welles provided narration for the tracks "Defender" from [[Manowar]]'s 1987 album ''[[Fighting the World]]'' and "Dark Avenger" on their 1982 album, ''[[Battle Hymns (Manowar album)|Battle Hymns]]''. He also recorded the concert introduction for the live performances of Manowar that says, "Ladies and gentlemen, from the United States of America, all hail Manowar." Manowar have been using this introduction for all of their concerts since then.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

During the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as ''[[The Dreamers (unfinished film)|The Dreamers]]'', based on two stories by [[Isak Dinesen]] and starring Oja Kodar, and ''[[Orson Welles' Magic Show]]'', which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was ''[[Filming The Trial]]'', the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.

In 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series ''[[Scene of the Crime (1984 TV series)|Scene of the Crime]]''. During the early years of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]]. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the ''Magnum, P.I.'' producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', episode "Paper War", 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled "I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)", which he recorded under Italian label [[Compagnia Generale del Disco]]. The song was performed with the [[Nick Perito]] Orchestra and the [[Ray Charles Singers]] and produced by [[Jerry Abbott]] (father of guitarist "[[Dimebag Darrell]]" Abbott).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Orson-Welles-I-Know-What-It-Is-To-Be-Young-But-You-Dont-Know-What-It-Is-To-Be-Old/release/1428788 |title=Orson Welles – I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old) (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=June 25, 1996 |access-date=December 21, 2012 |archive-date=April 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427091042/http://www.discogs.com/Orson-Welles-I-Know-What-It-Is-To-Be-Young-But-You-Dont-Know-What-It-Is-To-Be-Old/release/1428788 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films ''[[Enchanted Journey]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' (1986), in which he played the planet-eating [[robot]] [[Unicron]]. His last film appearance was in [[Henry Jaglom]]'s 1987 independent film ''[[Someone to Love (1987 film)|Someone to Love]]'', released two years after his death but produced before his voice-over in ''Transformers: The Movie''. His last television appearance was on the television show ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.

In the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York. Edited transcripts of these sessions appear in [[Peter Biskind]]'s 2013 book ''My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles''.&lt;ref name=Biskind&gt;{{cite web|last=Biskind|first=Peter|title=Three Courses of Orson Welles|url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/06/orson-welles-lunch-with-henry-jaglom.html|work=New York magazine|access-date=June 28, 2013|archive-date=June 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630110658/http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/orson-welles-lunch-with-henry-jaglom.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, Welles had a brief relationship with [[Maila Nurmi]], who, according to the bio ''Glamour Ghoul: The Passions and Pain of the Real Vampira, Maila Nurmi,'' became pregnant; since Welles was at the time married to Hayworth, Nurmi gave the child up for adoption.&lt;ref name=Nurmi&gt;[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-01-12/vampira-hollywoods-original-goth-emerges-in-new-biography Vampira, Hollywood’s original Goth, emerges from the shadows in a new biography], by Scott Bradfield, in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''; published January 12, 2021; retrieved January 17, 2021&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- the LA Times piece doesn't say 'in the 40s', but does say that by the time Nurmi gave birth, Welles was married to Hayworth, so that's an indicator.--&gt;

However, the child mentioned in the book was born in 1944. Nurmi revealed in an interview weeks before her death in January 2008 how she met Welles in a New York casting office in the spring of 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 19, 2021|title=Retired lawyer is the son of Vampira but is Orson Welles the father?|url=https://www.wellesnet.com/vampira-orson-welles-son/|access-date=February 20, 2021|website=Wellesnet {{!}} Orson Welles Web Resource|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles—"Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10"—in the February 19, 1926, issue of ''[[The Capital Times]]''. The article falsely states that he was descended from "Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln's cabinet".&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;{{Rp|47–48}}&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;{{Rp|311}} As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon ''Wells''), son of [[William H. Wells|William Hill Wells]], son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===
Peter Noble's 1956 biography describes Welles as "a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice".&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;Noble, Peter, ''The Fabulous Orson Welles''. London: [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson and Co.]], 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19}} Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a [[Tenor#heldentenor|heldentenor]], a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the [[Gate Theatre]] in [[Dublin]], he forced his voice down into a [[bass-baritone]].&lt;ref name="Tarbox" /&gt;{{Rp|144}}

Even as a baby, Welles was prone to illness, including [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[whooping cough]], and [[malaria]]. From infancy he suffered from [[asthma]], sinus headaches, and backache&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|8}} that was later found to be caused by congenital anomalies of the spine. Foot and ankle trouble throughout his life was the result of [[flat feet]].&lt;ref name="Callow Xanadu"&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon |last=Callow | title=Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu | isbn=978-0-09-946251-4|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|560}} "As he grew older", Brady wrote, "his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco".&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

In 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall (1.83 meters) and weighed over 180 pounds (81.6&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="Higham" /&gt;{{Rp|50}} His passport recorded his height as six feet three inches (192&amp;nbsp;cm), with brown hair and green eyes.&lt;ref name="Feder" /&gt;{{Rp|229}}

"Crash diets, [pharmaceutical] drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles", wrote biographer Barton Whaley. "Then always back to gargantuan consumption of high-caloric food and booze. By summer 1949, when he was 34, his weight had crept up to a stout 230 pounds (104 kg). In 1953, he ballooned from 250 to 275 pounds (113 to 125 kg). After 1960, he remained permanently obese."&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt;{{Rp|329}}

=== Religious beliefs ===
When Peter Bogdanovich once asked him about his religion, Welles gruffly replied that it was none of his business, then misinformed him that he was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|xxx}}&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt;{{Rp|12}}

Although the Welles family was no longer devout, it was fourth-generation [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopalian]] and, before that, [[Quakers|Quaker]] and [[Puritan]].&lt;ref name="Whaley"&gt;[http://www.lybrary.com/barton-whaley-m-191.html Whaley, Barton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407122754/http://www.lybrary.com/barton-whaley-m-191.html |date=April 7, 2016 }}, ''Orson Welles: The Man Who Was Magic''.

In April 1982, when interviewer [[Merv Griffin]] asked him about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, "I try to be a Christian. I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God."&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|576}} Near the end of his life, Welles was dining at [[Ma Maison]], his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at [[Saint Sophia Cathedral, Los Angeles|Saint Sophia Cathedral]]. Welles replied, "Please tell him I really appreciate that offer, but I am an [[Atheism|atheist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Terrail, Patrick, ''A Taste of Hollywood: The Story of Ma Maison''.

"Orson never joked or teased about the religious beliefs of others", wrote biographer Barton Whaley. "He accepted it as a cultural artifact, suitable for the births, deaths, and marriages of strangers and even some friends—but without emotional or intellectual meaning for himself."&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt;{{Rp|12}}

== Politics and activities ==
Welles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with the [[Left-wing politics|left]] throughout his life,&lt;ref name=Callow&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/20/biography.film |title=This Greater Drama |first=Simon |last=Callow |date=May 19, 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=December 4, 2016 |archive-date=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406143244/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/20/biography.film |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and always defined his political orientation as "[[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]". He was an outspoken critic of [[racism in the United States]] and the practice of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt;{{Rp|46}} He was a strong supporter of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]] and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics.&lt;ref name=Callow/&gt; He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.&lt;ref name=Callow/&gt; Welles did not support the 1948 presidential bid of Roosevelt's second vice president [[Henry A.

"During a White House dinner," Welles recalled in a 1983 conversation with his friend Roger Hill, "when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, 'Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.' In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged me to run for a Senate seat in either California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone."&lt;ref name="Tarbox" /&gt;{{Rp|115}} In the 1980s, Welles still expressed admiration for Roosevelt but also described his presidency as "a [[hybrid regime|semidictatorship]]."&lt;ref name=Biskind2013&gt;Peter Biskind (ed.).

During a 1970 appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', Welles claimed to have met Hitler while hiking in Austria with a teacher who was a "budding [[Nazi]]". He said that Hitler made no impression on him at all and does not remember him.  He said that he had no personality at all: "He was invisible. There was nothing there until there were 5,000 people yelling sieg heil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_PUUHLknDI|title=When Orson Welles Crossed Paths With Hitler and Churchill |date=July 27, 1970|people=Orson Welles, Dick Cavett |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin—a seat that was ultimately won by [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref name=Callow /&gt;

Welles's political activities were reported on pages 155–157 of ''[[Red Channels]]'', the [[anti-Communist]] publication that, in part, fueled the already flourishing [[Hollywood Blacklist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/4-cwhomefront/1-mccarthyism/Red_Channels/index.html | title=Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television (1950) | date=July 18, 2012 | work=AuthenticHistory.com | access-date=May 30, 2015 | archive-date=May 3, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503083656/http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/4-cwhomefront/1-mccarthyism/Red_Channels/index.html | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in Europe during the height of the [[Red Scare]], thereby adding one more reason for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/06/mcb1-j16.html |title=Orson Welles, the blacklist and Hollywood filmmaking—Part 1 |last1=Walsh |first1=David |last2=Laurier |first2=Joanne |date=June 16, 2009 |website=World Socialist Website |access-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408205823/https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/06/mcb1-j16.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and tributes ==
On the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming. "Both Welles and Leaming talked of Welles's life, and the segment was a nostalgic interlude," wrote biographer Frank Brady.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|590–591|date=May 2014}} Welles returned to his house in Hollywood and worked into the early hours typing stage directions for [[Orson Welles' Magic Show|the project]] he and Gary Graver were planning to shoot at UCLA the following day. Welles died sometime on the morning of October 10, following a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|453|date=May 2014}} He was found by his chauffeur at around 10 a.m.; the first of Welles's friends to arrive was Paul Stewart.&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;[[Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph]], ''What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?

Welles was [[cremated]] by prior agreement with the executor of his estate, [[Greg Garrison]],&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|592}} whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s made it possible for Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|549–550}} A brief private funeral was attended by Paola Mori and Welles's three daughters—the first time they had ever been together. Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;{{Rp|298}} and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an awful experience.&lt;ref name="Feder" /&gt;{{Rp|1–9}}

A public memorial tribute&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|593}} took place November 2, 1985, at the [[Directors Guild of America]] Theater in Los Angeles. Host Peter Bogdanovich introduced speakers including [[Charles Champlin]], Geraldine Fitzgerald, Greg Garrison, Charlton Heston, Roger Hill, Henry Jaglom, [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]], Oja Kodar, Barbara Leaming, [[Janet Leigh]], Norman Lloyd, [[Dan O'Herlihy]], Patrick Terrail and Robert Wise.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|594}}&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;{{Rp|299–300}}

"I know what his feelings were regarding his death", Joseph Cotten later wrote. "He did not want a funeral; he wanted to be buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services&amp;nbsp;..." Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead, he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a [[Sonnet 30|Shakespeare sonnet]] that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday:&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;{{Rp|216}}

Welles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed. Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.

=== ''Don Quixote'' ===
{{Main|Don Quixote (unfinished film)}}
In the mid-1950s, Welles began work on ''Don Quixote'', initially a commission from [[CBS]] television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and [[Sancho Panza]] into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of [[Francisco Reiguera]], the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and, more important, Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time.

A version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 1992 to poor reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Don Quixote – Movie Reviews|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/don_quixote_1992/reviews|language=en|access-date=November 14, 2019|archive-date=April 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418230235/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/don_quixote_1992/reviews/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Muller, the film editor for The ''Trial'', ''Chimes at Midnight,'' and the CBS Special ''Orson Bag,'' worked on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version. When asked in 2013 by a journalist of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' for his opinion, he said that he felt that if released without image re-editing but with the addition of ''ad hoc'' sound and music, it probably would have been rather successful.

=== ''The Merchant of Venice'' ===

=== ''The Other Side of the Wind'' ===
{{Main|The Other Side of the Wind}}
In 1970, Welles began shooting ''The Other Side of the Wind''. The film relates the efforts of a film director (played by [[John Huston]]) to complete his last Hollywood picture and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972 the filming was reported by Welles as being "96% complete",&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|546}} though by 1979 Welles had only edited about 40 minutes of the film.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum" /&gt;{{Rp|320}} In that year, legal complications over the ownership of the film put the negative into a Paris vault. In 2004 director [[Peter Bogdanovich]], who acted in the film, announced his intention to complete the production.

On October 28, 2014, Los Angeles-based production company Royal Road Entertainment announced it had negotiated an agreement, with the assistance of producer [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], and would purchase the rights to complete and release ''The Other Side of the Wind''. Bogdanovich and Marshall planned to complete Welles's nearly finished film in Los Angeles, aiming to have it ready for screening on May 6, 2015, the 100th anniversary of Welles's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/movies/hollywood-ending-near-for-orson-welles-last-film.html |date=October 28, 2014 |title=Hollywood Ending Near for Orson Welles's Last Film |access-date=October 29, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |last1=Carvajal |first1=Doreen |archive-date=March 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315191604/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/movies/hollywood-ending-near-for-orson-welles-last-film.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Road Entertainment and German producer Jens Koethner Kaul acquired the rights held by Les Films de l'Astrophore and the late Mehdi Boushehri.

On November 2, 2018, the film debuted in select theaters and on [[Netflix]], forty-eight years after principal photography began.

Some footage is included in the documentaries ''Working with Orson Welles'' (1993), ''Orson Welles: One Man Band'' (1995), and most extensively ''[[They'll Love Me When I'm Dead]]'' (2018).

=== Other unfinished films and unfilmed screenplays ===
==== ''Too Much Johnson'' ====
''[[Too Much Johnson]]'' is a 1938 [[comedy film]] written and directed by Welles. Designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury Theatre stage presentation of [[William Gillette]]'s 1894 comedy, the film was not completely edited or publicly screened. ''Too Much Johnson'' was considered a [[lost film]] until August 2013, with news reports that a pristine print had been discovered in Italy in 2008. A copy restored by the [[George Eastman House]] museum was scheduled to premiere October 9, 2013, at the [[Pordenone Silent Film Festival]], with a U.S. premiere to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10230843/Unfinished-Orson-Welles-film-found-in-Italy.html |title=Unfinished Orson Welles film found in Italy |newspaper=Telegraph |access-date=August 9, 2013 |date=August 8, 2013 |last1=McKenna |first1=Josephine |archive-date=August 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825050920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10230843/Unfinished-Orson-Welles-film-found-in-Italy.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shown at a single screening at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on May 3, 2014.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}  A single performance of ''Too Much Johnson'', on February 2, 2015, at the Film Forum in New York City, was a great success.

==== ''Heart of Darkness'' ====
''Heart of Darkness'' was Welles's projected first film, in 1940. It was planned in extreme detail and some test shots were filmed; the footage is now lost. It was planned to be entirely shot in [[long take]]s from the point of view of the narrator, [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]], who would be played by Welles; his reflection would occasionally be seen in the window as his boat sailed down river. The project was abandoned because it could not be delivered on budget, and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' was made instead.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|30–33, 355–356|date=May 2012}}

==== ''Santa'' ====
In 1941, Welles planned a film with his then partner, the Mexican actress [[Dolores del Río]]. ''Santa'' was adapted from the novel by Mexican writer [[Federico Gamboa]]. The film would have marked the debut of Dolores del Río in the Mexican cinema. Welles made a correction of the script in 13 extraordinary sequences. The high salary demanded by del Río stopped the project. In 1943, the film was finally completed with the settings of Welles, led by [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]] and starring Mexican actress [[Esther Fernández]].&lt;ref name="Ramón 1997,vol. 1, p. 59"&gt;Ramón (1997),vol. 1, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Way to Santiago'' ====
In 1941 Welles also planned a Mexican drama with Dolores del Río, which he gave to RKO to be budgeted. The film was a movie version of the novel by the same name by Calder Marshall. In the story, del Río would play Elena Medina, "the most beautiful girl in the world", with Welles playing an American who becomes entangled in a mission to disrupt a Nazi plot to overthrow the Mexican government. Welles planned to shoot in Mexico, but the Mexican government had to approve the story, and this never occurred.&lt;ref name="Ramón 1997,vol. 1, p. 59" /&gt;

==== ''The Life of Christ'' ====
In 1941, Welles received the support of [[Fulton J. Sheen|Bishop Fulton Sheen]] for a retelling of the life of Christ, to be set in the American West in the 1890s. After filming of ''Citizen Kane'' was complete,&lt;ref&gt;Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, ''[[This is Orson Welles]]''. HarperAudio, September 30, 1992. {{ISBN|1559946806}} Audiotape 1A 13:07–14:46.&lt;/ref&gt; Welles, [[Perry Ferguson]], and [[Gregg Toland]] scouted locations in Baja California and Mexico. Welles wrote a screenplay with dialogue from the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke. "Every word in the film was to be from the Bible — no original dialogue, but done as a sort of American primitive," Welles said, "set in the frontier country in the last century." The unrealized project was revisited by Welles in the 1950s, when he wrote a second unfilmed screenplay, to be shot in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|361–362|date=April 2014}}

==== ''It's All True'' ====
Welles did not originally want to direct ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'', a 1942 documentary about South America, but after its abandonment by RKO, he spent much of the 1940s attempting to buy the negative of his material from RKO, so that he could edit and release it in some form. The footage remained unseen in vaults for decades and was assumed lost. Over 50 years later, some (but not all) of the surviving material saw release in the 1993 documentary ''It's All True: Based on an Unfinished Film by Orson Welles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1993/10/it-s-all-true-based-on-an-unfinished-film-by-orson-welles/|title=It's All True: Based on an Unfinished Film by Orson Welles|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jonathan|date=October 22, 1993|website=jonathanrosenbaum.net|access-date=December 25, 2018|archive-date=December 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226035350/https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1993/10/it-s-all-true-based-on-an-unfinished-film-by-orson-welles/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Monsieur Verdoux'' ====
In 1944, Welles wrote the first-draft script of ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'', a film that he also intended to direct. [[Charlie Chaplin]] initially agreed to star in it, but later changed his mind, citing never having been directed by someone else in a [[feature film|feature]] before. Chaplin bought the film rights and made the film himself in 1947, with some changes. The final film credits Chaplin with the script, "based on an idea by Orson Welles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/filming/articles/8-Filming-Monsieur-Verdoux|title=Charlie Chaplin : Filming Monsieur Verdoux|website=www.charliechaplin.com|access-date=December 10, 2019|archive-date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210045146/https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/filming/articles/8-Filming-Monsieur-Verdoux|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' ====
Welles spent around nine months around 1947–48 co-writing the screenplay for ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' along with [[Ben Hecht]], a project Welles was assigned to direct for [[Alexander Korda]]. He began scouting for locations in Europe whilst filming ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]'', but Korda was short of money, so sold the rights to Columbia pictures, who eventually dismissed Welles from the project, and then sold the rights to [[United Artists]], who in turn made [[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|a film version in 1950]], which was not based on Welles's script.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|106–108}}

==== ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' ====
After Welles's elaborate [[Around the World (musical)|musical stage version]] of this [[Jules Verne]] novel, encompassing 38 different sets, went live in 1946, Welles shot some test footage in Morocco in 1947 for a film version. The footage was never edited, funding never came through, and Welles abandoned the project. Nine years later, the stage show's producer [[Mike Todd]] made [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|his own award-winning film version of the book]].&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|402}}

==== ''Moby Dick—Rehearsed'' ====
''[[Moby Dick—Rehearsed]]'' was a film version of Welles's 1955 London meta-play, starring [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], and with Welles as [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Ahab]]. Using bare, minimalist sets, Welles alternated between a cast of nineteenth-century actors rehearsing a production of ''Moby Dick'', with scenes from ''Moby Dick'' itself. [[Kenneth Williams]], a cast member who was apprehensive about the entire project, recorded in his autobiography that Welles's dim, atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable. The entire play was filmed but is now presumed lost. This was made during one weekend at the [[Hackney Empire]] theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.str.org.uk/events/lectures/archive/lecture0811.shtml |title=See also the relevant entries for 'Moby Dick' in Kenneth Williams' autobiography ''Just Williams'' |publisher=Str.org.uk |access-date=March 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219084657/http://www.str.org.uk/events/lectures/archive/lecture0811.shtml |archive-date=February 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Histoires extraordinaires'' ====
The producers of ''[[Histoires extraordinaires]]'', a 1968 [[anthology film]] based on short stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], announced in June 1967 that Welles would direct one segment based on both "[[Masque of the Red Death]]" and "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" for the omnibus film. Welles withdrew in September 1967 and was replaced. The script, written in English by Welles and Oja Kodar, is in the Filmmuseum Munchen collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=French |first=Lawrence |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2009/08/30/supernal-dreams-orson-welless-unfilmed-edgar-allan-poe-script-for-spirits-of-the-dead/ |title=''Cinefantastique'' (August 30, 2009) |publisher=Cinefantastiqueonline.com |date=August 30, 2009 |access-date=March 20, 2012 |archive-date=September 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905162524/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2009/08/30/supernal-dreams-orson-welless-unfilmed-edgar-allan-poe-script-for-spirits-of-the-dead/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''One-Man Band'' ====
This [[Monty Python]]-esque spoof in which Welles plays all but one of the characters (including two characters in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]), was made around 1968–9. Welles intended this completed sketch to be one of several items in a television special on London. Other items filmed for this special – all included in the "One Man Band" documentary by his partner Oja Kodar&amp;nbsp;— comprised a sketch on Winston Churchill (played in silhouette by Welles), a sketch on [[Peerage|peers]] in a stately home, a feature on [[gentlemen's clubs|London gentlemen's clubs]], and a sketch featuring Welles being mocked by his snide [[Savile Row]] tailor (played by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]).

==== ''Treasure Island'' ====
Welles wrote two screenplays for ''[[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|Treasure Island]]'' in the 1960s, and was eager to seek financial backing to direct it. His plan was to film it in Spain in concert with ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''. Welles intended to play the part of Long John Silver. He wanted [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] to play Doctor Livesey and [[John Gielgud]] to take on the role of Squire Trelawney. Australian-born child actor Fraser MacIntosh (''[[The Boy Cried Murder]]''), then 11-years old, was cast as Jim Hawkins and flown to Spain for the shoot, which would have been directed by Jess Franco. About 70 percent of the ''Chimes at Midnight'' cast would have had roles in ''Treasure Island''. However, funding for the project fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellesnet.com/lost-treasure-orson-welles-aborted-treasure-island/|title=Lost treasure: Orson Welles' aborted 'Treasure Island'|date=September 6, 2016|website=Wellesnet {{!}} Orson Welles Web Resource|language=en-US|access-date=November 14, 2019|archive-date=March 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330120643/http://www.wellesnet.com/lost-treasure-orson-welles-aborted-treasure-island/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Eventually, Welles's own screenplay (under the pseudonym of O.W.

==== ''The Deep'' ====
''[[The Deep (Orson Welles film)|The Deep]]'', an adaptation of [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]]'s ''[[Dead Calm (novel)|Dead Calm]]'', was entirely set on two boats and shot mostly in close-ups. It was filmed off the coasts of [[Yugoslavia]] and [[the Bahamas]] between 1966 and 1969, with all but one scene completed. It was originally planned as a commercially viable thriller, to show that Welles could make a popular, successful film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2008novdec/welles.html|title=Orson Welles the Unknown – Harvard Film Archive|website=hcl.harvard.edu|access-date=September 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130173547/http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2008novdec/welles.html|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was put on hold in 1970 when Welles worried that critics would not respond favorably to this film as his theatrical follow-up to the much-lauded ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', and Welles focused instead on ''[[F for Fake]]''. It was abandoned altogether in 1973, perhaps due to the death of its star [[Laurence Harvey]]. In a 2015 interview, Oja Kodar blamed Welles's failure to complete the film on Jeanne Moreau's refusal to participate in its dubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adorocinema.com/noticias/filmes/noticia-113308/|title=Exclusivo: Oja Kodar revela segredos de Orson Welles em Mostra do centenário do diretor|last=AdoroCinema|work=AdoroCinema|access-date=September 13, 2018|archive-date=September 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913223420/http://www.adorocinema.com/noticias/filmes/noticia-113308/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Dune'' ====
''[[Jodorowsky's Dune|Dune]]'', an early attempt at adapting [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (novel)|sci-fi novel]] by Chilean film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], was to star Welles as the evil [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]]. Jodorowsky had personally chosen Welles for the role, but the planned film never advanced past pre-production.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==== ''Saint Jack'' ====
In 1978 Welles was lined up by his long-time protégé [[Peter Bogdanovich]] (who was then acting as Welles's ''de facto'' agent) to direct ''[[Saint Jack]]'', an adaptation of the 1973 [[Paul Theroux]] novel about an American pimp in Singapore. [[Hugh Hefner]] and Bogdanovich's then-partner [[Cybill Shepherd]] were both attached to the project as producers, with Hefner providing finance through his [[Playboy]] productions. However, both Hefner and Shepherd became convinced that Bogdanovich himself would be a more commercially viable director than Welles and insisted that Bogdanovich take over. Since Bogdanovich was also in need of work after a series of box office flops, he agreed. When the film was finally made in 1979 by Bogdanovich and Hefner (but without Welles or Shepherd's participation), Welles felt betrayed and according to Bogdanovich the two "drifted apart a bit".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, ''This is Orson Welles'' (New York, 1992, revised 1997 edition) pp.xxi-xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Filming The Trial'' ====
After the success of his 1978 film ''Filming Othello'' made for West German television, and mostly consisting of a monolog to the camera, Welles began shooting scenes for this follow-up film, but never completed it.&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;{{Rp|253|April 2014}}  What Welles did film was an 80-minute question-and-answer session in 1981 with film students asking about the film. The footage was kept by Welles's cinematographer [[Gary Graver]], who donated it to the Munich Film Museum, which then pieced it together with Welles's trailer for the film, into an 83-minute film which is occasionally screened at film festivals.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Written by Welles with Oja Kodar, ''[[The Big Brass Ring]]'' was adapted and filmed by director [[George Hickenlooper]] in partnership with writer [[F.X. Feeney]]. Both the Welles script and the 1999 film center on a U.S. presidential hopeful in his 40s, his elderly mentor—a former candidate for the Presidency, brought low by homosexual scandal—and the Italian journalist probing for the truth of the relationship between these men. During the last years of his life, Welles struggled to get financing for the planned film; however, his efforts at casting [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Paul Newman]] as the main character were unsuccessful. All of the actors turned down the role for various reasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==== ''The Cradle Will Rock'' ====
In 1984, Welles wrote the screenplay for a film he planned to direct, an autobiographical drama about the 1937 staging of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.&lt;ref name="Tarbox" /&gt;{{Rp|157–159}} [[Rupert Everett]] was slated to play the young Welles. However, Welles was unable to acquire funding. [[Tim Robbins]] later directed [[Cradle Will Rock|a similar film]], but it was not based on Welles's script.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==== ''King Lear'' ====
At the time of his death, Welles was in talks with a French production company to direct a film version of the Shakespeare play ''[[King Lear]]'', in which he would also play the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-king-lear/|title=Orson Welles and his unrealized 'King Lear'|date=March 1, 2018|website=Wellesnet {{!}} Orson Welles Web Resource|language=en-US|access-date=October 9, 2019|archive-date=October 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009130136/http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welles-king-lear/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle'' ====
''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'' was an adaptation of [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel. Welles admired Nabokov's ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'' and initiated a film project of the same title in collaboration with the author. Welles flew to Paris to discuss the project personally with Nabokov, because at that time the Russian author moved from America to Europe. Welles and Nabokov had a promising discussion, but the project was not finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Diamond|first=Jason|title=The Many Literary Adaptations of Orson Welles|url=https://www.flavorwire.com/465009/the-many-film-adaptations-of-orson-welles|access-date=April 21, 2021|website=Flavorwire|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
