'''Guns N' Roses''', often abbreviated as '''GNR''', is an American [[hard rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], California, formed in 1985. When they signed to [[Geffen Records]] in 1986, the band comprised vocalist [[Axl Rose]], lead guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], rhythm guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Steven Adler]]. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, guitarist [[Richard Fortus]], drummer [[Frank Ferrer]] and keyboardists [[Dizzy Reed]] and [[Melissa Reese]].

Guns N' Roses' debut album, ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] a year after its release, on the strength of the top 10 singles "[[Welcome to the Jungle]]", "[[Paradise City]]", and "[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]", the band's only single to reach number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|eleventh-bestselling album]]. Their next studio album, ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' (1988), reached number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, sold ten million copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included the top 5 hit "[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]". ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]],'' recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number two and number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The ''Illusion'' albums included the lead single "[[You Could Be Mine]]" (also featured in the film soundtrack for ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]''), covers of "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]" and "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]", and a trilogy of ballads ("[[Don't Cry]]", "[[November Rain]]", and "[[Estranged (song)|Estranged]]"), which featured [[List of most expensive music videos|notably high-budget music videos]]. The ''Illusion'' records were also supported by the extensive [[Use Your Illusion Tour]], a world tour that lasted from 1991–1993. ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]'' (1993), an album of covers, was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.

Work on a follow-up album stalled due to creative differences between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the ''Illusion''-era lineup. After a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses's long-awaited sixth studio album, ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' (2008), was released. At an estimated $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album in history. It debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200, but undersold industry expectations despite mostly positive critical reception. Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the [[Not in This Lifetime... Tour]], which became the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|third-highest-grossing concert tour on record]], grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.

In their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness drew comparisons to the early [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] and earned them the nickname "the most dangerous band in the world". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer [[Matt Sorum]], was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012, its first year of eligibility. Guns N' Roses have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling acts in history]].

The same manager ended up hating Axl and he wanted to fire him. We're all living together at this point and Axl and I sat down and went 'What are we going to do?' So we both said 'Fuck that', and came up with the name Guns N' Roses, which was going to be just a record label that we'd put singles out on.

In response to an interviewer's suggestion that replacing Adler with Sorum had turned Guns N' Roses from a rock 'n' roll band to a heavy metal band, Stradlin responded: "Yeah, a big musical difference. The first time I realized what Steve did for the band was when he broke his hand in Michigan ... So we had [[Fred Coury]] come in from [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] for the Houston show. Fred played technically good and steady, but the songs sounded just awful. They were written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel.

====Use Your Illusion Tour====
{{main|Use Your Illusion Tour}}
Before the release of the albums, Guns N' Roses embarked on the 28-month-long [[Use Your Illusion Tour]]. It became famous for both its financial success and the many controversial incidents that occurred at the shows. The tour had 192 dates in 27 countries, with over seven million people attending concerts.&lt;ref name="UYI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/history/history93.php|title=Here Today&amp;nbsp;...

On July 2, 1991, at the [[Riverport Amphitheater]] in [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]], outside the city of St Louis, Rose discovered that a fan was filming the show with a camera. After asking the venue's security to take away the camera, Rose jumped into the audience, had a heated confrontation with the fan, and assaulted him. After being pulled from the audience by members of the crew, Rose said, "Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!", threw his microphone to the ground and stormed off the stage. The angry [[Riverport Riot|crowd rioted]], injuring dozens. Footage was captured by [[Robert John (photographer)|Robert John]], who was documenting the tour. The police were unable to arrest Rose until almost a year later, as the band went overseas to continue the tour. Charges were filed against Rose, but a judge ruled that he did not directly incite the riot. In his defense, Rose stated that the Guns N' Roses security team had made four separate requests to the venue's security staff to remove the camera, which were ignored, and that other members of the band had reported being hit by bottles launched from the audience, while the security staff refused to enforce a drinking limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barat |first=Babu |date=September 1991 |title=There's A Riot Going On! |url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=75 |journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430175850/http://heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=75 |archive-date=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ''Use Your Illusion's'' liner notes featured a message amidst the ''Thank You'' section: "Fuck You, St. Louis!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/a-little-patience/Content?oid=2462300|title=A Little Patience|last1=Harper|first1=Jordan|date=June 30, 2004|website=riverfronttimes.com |access-date=May 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113020455/https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/a-little-patience/Content?oid=2462300|archive-date=January 13, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lineup changes and sporadic activity (1994–1999)===
Between 1994 and 1996, the band sporadically recorded new material.

====Title announcement and touring, tour cancellation and member departures====
In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in February 2000, Rose played several songs of the upcoming album to reporters, including "[[Chinese Democracy (song)|Chinese Democracy]]", "Catcher in the Rye", "I.R.S.", "[[Street of Dreams (Guns N' Roses song)|The Blues]]", "There Was a Time" and "Oklahoma".&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt; Rose mentioned that part of the delay of the new album was him 'educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock', stating that "it's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to be something you did on a computer."&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' described the album as "[[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Physical Graffiti]] remixed by [[Beck]] and [[Trent Reznor]].&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt; Rose mentioned that the expense of the record would be negated by the recording sessions yielding multiple albums, including a record that is "more industrial and electronica-influenced than Chinese Democracy".&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt; At that point, the album had gone through multiple producers, including [[Martin Glover|Youth]], [[Moby]], [[Mike Clink]], [[Roy Thomas Baker]], [[Eric Caudieux]]. At the time, [[Sean Beavan]] was producing, but Caram Costanzo and Axl Rose became the final credited producers on the album.&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/axl-speaks-20000203?page=3|title=Rolling Stone 833: Axl Speaks|first=David|last=Wild|date=February 3, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518113535/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/axl-speaks-20000203?page=3|archive-date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="produce" /&gt; The album had been completely re-recorded several times with varying musicians and producers.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In a 2001 interview, Rose described the album as having "all kinds of styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs" and said that it was "not [[Industrial rock|industrial]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=38|title=Axl interview Rock &amp; Pop FM Argentina|date=January 22, 2001|website=HereTodayGoneToHell.com|publisher=Rock &amp; Pop FM|access-date=June 13, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317014350/http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=38|archive-date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing why he continued using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose solo album', Rose stated "It is something I lived by before these guys were in it. And there were other people in Guns n' Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in any way. I am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer it to what it should be built like."&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt; Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to [[Addiction|drug addiction]]s and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," and that he "needed to take control to survive".&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt; Rose also described the dissolution as "a divorce".&lt;ref name="Axlspeaks" /&gt;

Jim Barber, a former [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R executive]] with [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] stated that the new album "reminded me of the best moments of Seventies [[Pink Floyd]] or later Led Zeppelin. There's nothing out there right now that has that kind of scope. Axl hasn't spent the last several years struggling to write Use Your Illusion over again."&lt;ref name="WHTA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=32|title=What Happened To Axl Rose – The inside story of rock's most famous recluse|date=May 11, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906062814/http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=32|archive-date=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years after the previous Guns N' Roses concert, the band made a public appearance in January 2001 with two well-received concerts: one in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and one at the [[Rock in Rio]] Festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The band played both songs from previous albums and songs from then-unreleased ''Chinese Democracy''. During the band's Rock in Rio set, Rose made the following comment regarding former members of the band:

{{quote|I know that many of you are disappointed that some of the people you came to know and love could not be with us here today.

On February 6, 2009, Rose gave his first interview in nine years when he sat down with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Jonathan Cohen (television executive)|Jonathan Cohen]].&lt;ref name="billboard.com"/&gt; Rose said that there was no chance that he would ever agree with a reunion with Slash:

Rose was, however, open to working again with Stradlin and McKagan (both of whom he has worked with since the interview took place):

{{quote|I could see doing a song or so on the side with Izzy or having him out [on tour] again. I'm not so comfortable with doing anything having more than one of the alumni.

Sometimes you think, "How can you top anything by [[The Yardbirds]], or [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]], or [[The Rolling Stones|the Stones]]?" And then you hear Guns n' Roses, and it's inspiring.
