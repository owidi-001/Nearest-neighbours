'''George Herbert Walker Bush'''&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Since around 2000 he has usually been called '''George H. W. Bush''', '''Bush Senior''', '''Bush 41''' or '''Bush the Elder''' to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009; previously he was usually referred to simply as '''George Bush'''.&lt;/ref&gt; (June 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2018) was an American politician, diplomat, and businessman who served as the 41st [[president of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bush also served as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] from 1981 to 1989 under [[Ronald Reagan]], in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], and as [[Director of Central Intelligence]].

Bush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], [[United States]], and attended [[Phillips Academy]] before serving in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he graduated from Yale and moved to [[West Texas]], where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate, he won the election to the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district of Texas]] in 1966. President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and to the position of [[chairman of the Republican National Committee]] in 1973. In 1974, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]], and in 1976 Bush became the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican presidential primaries]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.

In the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the fourth incumbent vice president to be elected president and the first to do so since [[Martin Van Buren]] in [[1836 United States Presidential Election|1836]]. Foreign policy drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]], as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Bush presided over the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the Iraqi occupation of [[Kuwait]] in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Domestically, Bush reneged on [[Read my lips: no new taxes|a 1988 campaign promise]] by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] and appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the Supreme Court. Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post–Cold War political climate.

After leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside [[Bill Clinton]], his former opponent. With the victory of his son, [[George W. Bush]], in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the two became the second father–son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Another son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]]. Historians generally [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|rank]] Bush as an above-average president.

(which later merged into [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.]]) the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush spent most of his childhood in Greenwich, at the family vacation home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]],{{efn|Bush later purchased the estate, which is now known as the [[Bush compound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/08/us/white-house-letter-at-parents-home-bush-resumes-role-of-son.html|work=The New York Times |access-date=April 2, 2008 |date=July 8, 2002 |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |title=White House Letter; At Parents' Home, Bush Resumes Role of Son}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} or at his maternal grandparents' plantation in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the family's wealth, Bush was largely unaffected by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Greenwich Country Day School]] from 1929 to 1937 and [[Phillips Academy]], an elite private academy in Massachusetts, from 1937 to 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 27–36&lt;/ref&gt; While at Phillips Academy, he served as president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of the varsity baseball and soccer teams.&lt;ref name="andover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |title=Former President George Bush honored at his 60th reunion at Phillips Academy, Andover |date=June 8, 2002 |access-date=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Phillips Academy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401131455/http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |archive-date=April 1, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his 18th birthday, immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy, he enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] as a naval aviator.&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore/&gt; After a period of training, he was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]] on June 9, 1943, becoming one of the youngest aviators in the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For decades, Bush was considered the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy during his period of service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyd |first1=Gerald M. |title=A Victor Free to Set His Own Course |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/09/us/1988-elections-man-george-herbert-walker-bush-victor-free-set-his-own-course.html |work=The New York Times |date=November 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such claims are now regarded as speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Siegel |first1=Rachel |title=For George H.W.

Bush flew his first combat mission in May 1944, bombing Japanese-held [[Wake Island]],&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on August 1, 1944. During an attack on a Japanese installation in [[Chichijima]], Bush's aircraft successfully attacked several targets, but was downed by enemy fire.&lt;ref name="navy" /&gt; Though both of Bush's fellow crew members died, Bush successfully bailed out from the aircraft and was rescued by the {{USS|Finback|SS-230|6}}.&lt;ref name="meachamchichijima"&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Bush's fellow crew members for the mission were William G.

Bush returned to ''San Jacinto'' in November 1944, participating in operations in the Philippines. In early 1945, he was assigned to a new combat squadron, VT-153, where he trained to take part in an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of mainland Japan]]. On September 2, 1945, before any invasion took place, Japan formally surrendered following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was released from active duty that same month, but was not formally discharged from the Navy until October 1955, at which point he had reached the rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref name="navy" /&gt; By the end of his period of active service, Bush had flown 58 missions, completed 128 carrier landings, and recorded 1228 hours of flight time.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entire Bush family.jpg|thumb|left|Bush, top right, stood with his wife and children, mid-1960s]]
After graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to [[West Texas]]. Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush's relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the "daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker, two dominant figures in the financial world", but would still allow Bush to "call on their connections if he needed to raise capital."&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; His first position in Texas was an [[Oil fields|oil field]] equipment salesman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/11/local/me-bush11 |title=Two Future Presidents Slept Here&amp;nbsp;— latimes |date=October 11, 2005 |access-date=May 17, 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |last1=Chawkins |first1=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Dresser Industries]], which was led by family friend Neil Mallon.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 77, 83&lt;/ref&gt; While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: [[Odessa, Texas]]; [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Compton, California]]; and [[Midland, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/finding-aids/donated-materials/george-bush#zapata_oil |title=George Bush Collection |publisher=George Bush Presidential Library and Museum |access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of [[Republican (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. That same year, his father won election to represent Connecticut in the [[United States Senate]] as a member of the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;

With support from Mallon and Bush's uncle, [[George Herbert Walker Jr.]], Bush and John Overbey launched the Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he co-founded the [[HRG Group|Zapata Petroleum Corporation]], an oil company that drilled in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/4940/Bush-George-Herbert-Walker.html |title=George Herbert Walker Bush |publisher=Net Industries |access-date=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company, a subsidiary which specialized in [[offshore drilling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perin |first=Monica |date=April 25, 1999 |title=Adios, Zapata! |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/1999/04/26/story2.html |work=[[American City Business Journals|Houston Business Journal]] |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the subsidiary became independent in 1959, Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to [[Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W.

In 1988, ''[[The Nation]]'' published an article alleging that Bush worked as an operative of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) during the 1960s; Bush denied this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='63 F.B.I.

== Early political career (1963–1971) ==
=== Entry into politics ===
[[File:George Herbert Walker Bush and Eisenhower 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] with Bush]]

By the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat. He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored "big, centralized government". The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with [[John G. Tower]]'s victory in a 1961 special election to the [[United States Senate]]. Motivated by Tower's victory, and hoping to prevent the far-right [[John Birch Society]] from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] Republican Party, winning election in February 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 112–114&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] over the more centrist [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the [[1964 Republican Party presidential primaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Bush sought to unseat liberal Democrat [[Ralph W. Yarborough]] in Texas's [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|U.S. Senate election]].&lt;ref name="naftali13"&gt;Naftali (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Bolstered by superior fundraising, Bush won the Republican primary by defeating former gubernatorial nominee [[Jack Cox (Texas politician)|Jack Cox]] in a [[run-off election]]. In the general election, Bush attacked Yarborough's vote for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which banned racial and gender discrimination in public institutions and in many privately owned businesses. Bush argued that the act unconstitutionally expanded the powers of the federal government, but he was privately uncomfortable with the racial politics of opposing the act.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the election 56 percent to 44 percent, though he did run well ahead of [[Barry Goldwater]], the Republican presidential nominee.&lt;ref name="naftali13"/&gt; Despite the loss, the ''New York Times'' reported that Bush was "rated by political friend and foe alike as the Republicans' best prospect in Texas because of his attractive personal qualities and the strong campaign he put up for the Senate".&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
[[File:George H. W. Bush 91st Congress.jpg|thumb|upright|Bush in 1969]]
{{Further|Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson}}

In [[1966 United States House of Representatives elections|1966]], Bush ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Texas's 7th congressional district]], a newly redistricted seat in the [[Greater Houston]] area. Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent, Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 130–132&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest, House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]], making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; His voting record in the House was generally [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. He supported the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]]'s [[Vietnam War|Vietnam policies]], but broke with Republicans on the issue of [[birth control]], which he supported. He also voted for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], although it was generally unpopular in his district.&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://198.181.165.52/article?assetid=0068080-00&amp;templatename=/article/article.html |title=Bush, George Herbert Walker |access-date=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Scholastic Library Publishing, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615195838/http://198.181.165.52/article?assetid=0068080-00&amp;templatename=%2Farticle%2Farticle.html |archive-date=June 15, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/90-1967/h113|title=TO PASS H.R. 2516, A BILL TO ESTABLISH PENALTIES FOR INTERFERENCE WITH CIVIL RIGHTS.

Though most other Texas Republicans supported [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]], Bush endorsed [[Richard Nixon]], who went on to win the party's nomination. Nixon considered selecting Bush as his running mate in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], but he ultimately chose [[Spiro Agnew]] instead. Bush won re-election to the House unopposed, while Nixon defeated [[Hubert Humphrey]] in the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, with President Nixon's support, Bush gave up his seat in the House to [[1970 United States Senate election in Texas|run for the Senate]] against Yarborough. Bush easily won the Republican primary, but Yarborough was defeated by the more conservative [[Lloyd Bentsen]] in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Bentsen defeated Bush, taking 53.5 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nixon and Ford administrations (1971–1977) ==

=== Ambassador to the United Nations ===
[[File:George Bush as United Nations Representative, 1971-72 - NARA - 186386.tif|thumb|Bush as ambassador to the United Nations, 1971]]

After the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]], the two major U.S. rivals in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 152, 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China.&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2008), pp. 773–775&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted to expel the [[Republic of China]] and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971.&lt;ref name="nytimes19711031"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Austin |first1=Anthony |title=Crushing Defeat for the U.S., or A Blessing In Disguise? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/31/archives/crushing-defeat-for-the-us-or-a-blessing-in-disguise-enter-peking.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 31, 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971 crisis in [[Pakistan]], Bush supported an [[India]]n motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of [[Yahya Khan]] for waging genocide in [[East Pakistan]] (modern [[Bangladesh]]), referring to the "tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated".&lt;ref&gt;Saunders (2014), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because [[Yahya Khan]] was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders (2014), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chairman of the Republican National Committee ===

After Nixon won a landslide victory in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], he appointed Bush as chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nixontapes.org/presidents.html|title=President Richard Nixon and the Presidents|website=nixontapes.org|quote=CDHW 156-016 11/29/1972 Unknown time between 10:10 am and 1:47 pm P, GHWB}}[https://www.nixontapes.org/ghwb/156-016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In that position, he was charged with fundraising, candidate recruitment, and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media.

When Agnew was being investigated for corruption, Bush assisted, at the request of Nixon and Agnew, in pressuring [[John Glenn Beall Jr.]], the U.S. Senator from [[Maryland]] to force his brother, [[George Beall (attorney)|George Beall]] the [[U.S. Attorney]] in Maryland, who was supervising the investigation into Agnew. Attorney Beall ignored the pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/msnbc/maddow-bag-man-podcast/transcript-episode-4-turn-it-n935286|title=Transcript - Episode 4: Turn It Off|website=NBC News|access-date=January 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Bush's tenure at the RNC, the [[Watergate scandal]] emerged into public view; the scandal originated from the June 1972 break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]], but also involved later efforts to cover up the break-in by Nixon and other members of the White House.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Bush initially defended Nixon steadfastly, but as Nixon's complicity became clear he focused more on defending the Republican Party.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;

Following the resignation of Vice President Agnew in 1973 for a scandal unrelated to Watergate, Bush was considered for the position of vice president, but the appointment instead went to [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; After the public release of an [[Nixon White House tapes|audio recording]] that confirmed that Nixon had plotted to use the CIA to cover up the Watergate break-in, Bush joined other party leaders in urging Nixon to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 170–173&lt;/ref&gt; When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Bush noted in his diary that "There was an aura of sadness, like somebody died... The [resignation] speech was vintage Nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains. One couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame...

Upon his ascension to the presidency, Ford [[1974 United States vice presidential confirmation|strongly considered]] Bush, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for the vacant position of vice president. Ford ultimately chose Nelson Rockefeller, partly because of the publication of a news report claiming that Bush's 1970 campaign had benefited from a secret fund set up by Nixon; Bush was later cleared of any suspicion by a special prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the [[De facto embassy#China and the United States|U.S. Liaison Office]] in the People's Republic of China, making him the de facto ambassador to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George H.

Bush's campaign cast him as a youthful, "thinking man's candidate" who would emulate the pragmatic conservatism of President Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], which brought an end to a period of détente, and the [[Iran hostage crisis]], in which 52 Americans were taken hostage, the campaign highlighted Bush's foreign policy experience.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of the race, Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 [[Iowa caucuses]], making 31 visits to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Noble |first=Jason |date=November 30, 2018 |title=George H.W.

Days before the debate, Reagan announced that he would invite four other candidates to the debate; Bush, who had hoped that the one-on-one debate would allow him to emerge as the main alternative to Reagan in the primaries, refused to debate the other candidates. All six candidates took the stage, but Bush refused to speak in the presence of the other candidates. Ultimately, the other four candidates left the stage and the debate continued, but Bush's refusal to debate anyone other than Reagan badly damaged his campaign in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 230–233&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up decisively losing New Hampshire's primary to Reagan, winning just 23 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; Bush revitalized his campaign with a victory in Massachusetts, but lost the next several primaries. As Reagan built up a commanding delegate lead, Bush refused to end his campaign, but the other candidates dropped out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 233–235&lt;/ref&gt; Criticizing his more conservative rival's policy proposals, Bush famously labeled Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply side]]-influenced plans for massive tax cuts as "[[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Neikirk |first=William R. |date=March 13, 1988 |title=Bush conjures up voodoo economics |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-03-13-8802290552-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he favored lower taxes, Bush feared that dramatic reductions in taxation would lead to deficits and, in turn, cause inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;

After Reagan clinched a majority of delegates in late May, Bush reluctantly dropped out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 236–238&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], Reagan made the last-minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee after negotiations with Ford regarding a Reagan-Ford ticket collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cannon |first1=Lou |last2=Broder |first2=David S. |date=July 17, 1980 |title=Reagan Nominated, Picks Bush |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/07/17/reagan-nominated-picks-bush/a1badab9-a12b-4e7f-86a2-1bde75e03346/ |work=The Washington Post |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Reagan had resented many of the Bush campaign's attacks during the primary campaign, and several conservative leaders had actively opposed Bush's nomination, Reagan ultimately decided that Bush's popularity with moderate Republicans made him the best and safest pick. Bush, who had believed his political career might be over following the primaries, eagerly accepted the position and threw himself into campaigning for the Reagan-Bush ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 242–255&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 general election campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis, and Reagan sought to focus the race on Carter's handling of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Rossinow (2015), pp. 23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Though the race was widely regarded as a close contest for most of the campaign, Reagan ultimately won over the large majority of undecided voters.&lt;ref&gt;Rossinow (2015), pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan took 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes, while Carter won 41% of the popular vote and John Anderson, running as an independent candidate, won 6.6% of the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 149–151&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George H. W. Bush vice presidential portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait of Vice President Bush (1981)]]
As vice president, Bush generally maintained a low profile, recognizing the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. This approach helped him earn Reagan's trust, easing tensions left over from their earlier rivalry.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; Bush also generally enjoyed a good relationship with Reagan staffers, including his close friend Jim Baker, who served as Reagan's initial chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President [[Walter Mondale]], who enjoyed a strong relationship with President Carter in part because of his ability to avoid confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members, and by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the Ford administration.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 264–265&lt;/ref&gt; The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many [[state funeral]]s, which became a common joke for comedians.

On March 30, 1981, while Bush was in Texas, [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|Reagan was shot]] and seriously wounded by [[John Hinckley Jr.]] Bush immediately flew back to Washington D.C.; when his plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter in order to show that the government was still functioning.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; Bush rejected the idea, as he feared that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp Reagan's powers and prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 275–277&lt;/ref&gt; During Reagan's short period of incapacity, Bush presided over Cabinet meetings, met with congressional leaders and foreign leaders, and briefed reporters, but he consistently rejected the possibility of invoking the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on Reagan, who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting. From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the [[Oval Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |date=June 9, 2004 |title=The 40th President: Between 2 First Families, A Complicated Rapport |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/us/40th-president-presidential-relations-between-2-first-families-complicated.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, one on [[deregulation]] and one on international drug smuggling. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; The Reagan administration's deregulation push had a strong impact on broadcasting, finance, resource extraction, and other economic activities, and the administration eliminated numerous government positions.&lt;ref&gt;Leuchtenberg (2015), pp. 601–604&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also oversaw the administration's national security crisis management organization, which had traditionally been the responsibility of the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Bush toured [[Western Europe]] as part of the Reagan administration's ultimately successful efforts to convince skeptical [[NATO]] allies to support the deployment of [[Pershing II]] missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's approval ratings fell after his first year in office, but they bounced back when the United States began to emerge from recession in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Leuchtenberg (2015), pp. 620–621&lt;/ref&gt; Former Vice President Walter Mondale was nominated by the Democratic Party in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]].

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985. Rejecting the ideologically rigidity of his three elderly sick predecessors, Gorbachev insisted on urgently needed economic and political reforms called "glasnost" (openness) and "perestroika" (restructuring).&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2008), p. 894&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1987 [[Washington Summit (1987)|Washington Summit]], Gorbachev and Reagan signed the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]], which committed both signatories to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty marked the beginning of a new era of trade, openness, and cooperation between the two powers.&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2008), pp. 897–898&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan and Secretary of State [[George Shultz]] took the lead in these negotiations, but Bush sat in on many meetings.

In 1986, the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti-communist [[Contras]] in Nicaragua. Democrats had passed a law that appropriated funds could not be used to help the Contras.

[[File:Gwbush1988stl.jpg|thumb|[[John Ashcroft]] and Vice President Bush campaign in St. Louis, Missouri, 1988]]

Bush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election, and he officially entered the [[1988 Republican Party presidential primaries]] in October 1987.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer [[Lee Atwater]], and which also included his son, George W. Bush, and media consultant [[Roger Ailes]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president, endorsing a [[Human Life Amendment]] and repudiating his earlier comments on "voodoo economics," Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of [[Kansas]], Congressman [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, and Christian [[televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate, but he privately expressed support for Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 318, 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Though considered the early front-runner for the nomination, Bush came in third in the [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa caucus]], behind Dole and Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC143CF933A25751C0A96E948260|title=Bush and Simon Seen as Hobbled by Iowa's Voting|date=February 10, 1988|access-date=April 4, 2008|work=The New York Times | first=R. W. | last=Apple Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as Reagan had done in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the [[New Hampshire]] primary.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; With help from Governor [[John H. Sununu]] and an effective campaign attacking Dole for raising taxes, Bush overcame an initial polling deficit and won New Hampshire with 39 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 322–325&lt;/ref&gt; After Bush won South Carolina and 16 of the 17 states holding a primary on [[Super Tuesday]], his competitors dropped out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush, occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, delivered a well-received speech at the Republican convention. Known as the "[[thousand points of light]]" speech, it described Bush's vision of America: he endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], [[school prayer|prayer in schools]], [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], and [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|gun rights]].&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html|title=1988: George H.

And all I can say to them is: read my lips. No new taxes."&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Bush [[Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection, 1988|selected]] little-known Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]] as his running mate. Though Quayle had compiled an unremarkable record in Congress, he was popular among many conservatives, and the campaign hoped that Quayle's youth would appeal to younger voters.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1988.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Bush won the 1988 presidential election with 53.4% of the popular vote and a large majority of the electoral vote]]

Meanwhile, the Democratic Party nominated Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], who was known for presiding over an economic turnaround in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt; Leading in the general election polls against Bush, Dukakis ran an ineffective, low-risk campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 39, 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush campaign attacked Dukakis as an unpatriotic liberal extremist and seized on the [[Willie Horton]] case, in which a convicted felon from Massachusetts raped a woman while on a [[prison furlough]], a program Dukakis supported as governor. The Bush campaign charged that Dukakis presided over a "[[revolving door]]" that allowed dangerous convicted felons to leave prison.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; Dukakis damaged his own campaign with a widely mocked ride in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank and a poor performance at the second presidential debate.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also attacked Dukakis for opposing a law that would require all students to recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; The election is widely considered to have had a high level of negative campaigning, though political scientist John Geer has argued that the share of negative ads was in line with previous presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 347–348&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush defeated Dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], and he took 53.4 percent of the national popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1988 Presidential General Election Results|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1988|website=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country, but especially in the [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first sitting vice president to be elected president since [[Martin Van Buren]] in [[1836 United States presidential election|1836]] and the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since [[Herbert Hoover]] in [[Inauguration of Herbert Hoover|1929]].&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;{{efn|The 1988 presidential election remains the only presidential election since 1948 in which either party won a third consecutive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Silver |first1=Nate |title=The White House Is Not a Metronome |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-white-house-is-not-a-metronome/ |work=FiveThirtyEight |date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the concurrent [[1988 United States elections|congressional elections]], Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's first major appointment was that of [[James Baker]] as Secretary of State.&lt;ref name="greene5355"&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership of the Department of Defense went to [[Dick Cheney]], who had previously served as Gerald Ford's chief of staff and would later serve as vice president under his son George W. Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Naftali (2007), pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Kemp joined the administration as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, while [[Elizabeth Dole]], the wife of Bob Dole and a former Secretary of Transportation, became the Secretary of Labor under Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Bush retained several Reagan officials, including Secretary of the Treasury [[Nicholas F.

During the first year of his tenure, Bush put a pause on Reagan's détente policy toward the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev; some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer, but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]]. The U.S. was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the [[Eastern Bloc]] to avoid undermining further democratic reforms.&lt;ref name="herring904906"&gt;Herring (2008), pp. 904–906&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush and Gorbachev met at the [[Malta Summit]] in December 1989. Though many on the right remained wary of Gorbachev, Bush came away with the belief that Gorbachev would negotiate in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 385–387&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of his term, Bush sought cooperative relations with Gorbachev, believing that he was the key to peace.&lt;ref&gt;Naftali (2007), pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; The primary issue at the Malta Summit was the potential [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]].

Gorbachev used force to suppress nationalist movements within the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; A crisis in Lithuania left Bush in a difficult position, as he needed Gorbachev's cooperation in the reunification of Germany and feared that the collapse of the Soviet Union could leave nuclear arms in dangerous hands. The Bush administration mildly protested Gorbachev's suppression of Lithuania's independence movement, but took no action to directly intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2008), p. 907&lt;/ref&gt; Bush warned independence movements of the disorder that could come with secession from the Soviet Union; in a 1991 address that critics labeled the "[[Chicken Kiev speech]]", he cautioned against "suicidal nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2008), pp. 907, 913–914&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1991, Bush and Gorbachev signed the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)]] treaty, in which both countries agreed to cut their strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USSR Republics numbered by alphabet.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into fifteen independent republics, including Russia (labeled 11)]]

In August 1991, hard-line Communists launched a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup]] against Gorbachev; while the coup quickly fell apart, it broke the remaining power of Gorbachev and the central Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;Naftali (2007), pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Gorbachev resigned as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary of the Communist party]], and Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] ordered the seizure of Soviet property.

==== Invasion of Panama ====
{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}

During the 1980s, the U.S. had provided aid to [[Panama]]nian leader [[Manuel Noriega]], an anti-Communist dictator who engaged in drug trafficking. In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which [[Guillermo Endara]] had been elected. Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the [[Panama Canal]] with Noriega still in office.&lt;ref name="patterson226227"&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in violation of prior treaties.&lt;ref name="rutgers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm|title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989|access-date=April 11, 2008|author=Franklin, Jane|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered the [[United States invasion of Panama]], known as "Operation Just Cause". The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War. American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and [[Panama City]]. Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States. Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded. Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.&lt;ref name="patterson226227"/&gt; Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion "represented a new era in American foreign policy" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the threat of Communism, but rather on the grounds that it was in the best interests of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Brewer|title=Borders and Bridges: A History of U.S.-Latin American Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPod9HcYUJ4C&amp;pg=PA146|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood |page=146|isbn=9780275982041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gulf War ====
{{Main|Gulf War}}
[[File:Iraq Kuwait Locator.svg|thumb|Iraq (green) invaded Kuwait (orange) in 1990]]

Faced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to conquer the country of [[Kuwait]], a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; After Iraq [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed [[Sanctions against Iraq|economic sanctions]] on Iraq and assembled a [[Coalition of the Gulf War|multi-national coalition]] opposed to the invasion.&lt;ref name="patterson230232"&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 230–232&lt;/ref&gt; The administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack [[Saudi Arabia]] or Israel, and wanted to discourage other countries from similar aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Herring (2008), pp. 908–909&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

At Bush's insistence, in November 1990, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdrawal from Kuwait by January 15, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev's support, as well as China's abstention, helped ensure passage of the UN resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 146–147, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Bush convinced Britain, France, and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq, and he won important financial backing from Germany, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 149–151&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1991, Bush asked Congress to approve a joint resolution authorizing a war against Iraq.&lt;ref name="patterson232233"&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; Bush believed that the UN resolution had already provided him with the necessary authorization to launch a military operation against Iraq, but he wanted to show that the nation was united behind a military action.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate, Congress approved the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]].&lt;ref name="patterson232233"/&gt;

After the January 15 deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, U.S. and coalition forces began a conducted a bombing campaign that devastated Iraq's power grid and communications network, and resulted in the desertion of about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers. In retaliation, Iraq launched [[Scud]] missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia, but most of the missiles did little damage. On February 23, coalition forces began a ground invasion into Kuwait, evicting Iraqi forces by the end of February 27. About 300 Americans, as well as approximately 65 soldiers from other coalition nations, died during the military action.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 233–235&lt;/ref&gt; A cease fire was arranged on March 3, and the UN passed a resolution establishing a [[United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission|peacekeeping force]] in a demilitarized zone between Kuwait and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; A March 1991 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll showed that Bush had an approval rating of 89 percent, the highest presidential approval rating in the history of Gallup polling.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman (1996), p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; After 1991, the UN maintained economic sanctions against Iraq, and the [[United Nations Special Commission]] was assigned to ensure that Iraq did not revive its [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction program]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the U.S. and Canada had reached a [[free trade agreement]] that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries. President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States, Canada, and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilentz (2008), pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration, along with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]], spearheaded the negotiations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) with Mexico.

=== Domestic affairs ===
==== Economy and fiscal issues ====

The U.S. economy had generally performed well since emerging from [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|recession in late 1982]], but it slipped into a mild [[Early 1990s recession in the United States|recession in 1990]]. The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991.&lt;ref name="Accepting the Harsh Truth Of a Blue-Collar Recession, New York Times, Dec. 25, 1991"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/business/accepting-the-harsh-truth-of-a-blue-collar-recession.html Accepting the Harsh Truth Of a Blue-Collar Recession], ''New York Times'' (Archives), Steve Lohr, December 25, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blue-collar Towns Have Highest Jobless Numbers, Hartford Courant, Sept. 1, 1991"&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1991-09-01/business/0000212544_1_white-collar-unemployment-aetna-life Blue-collar Towns Have Highest Jobless Numbers], ''Hartford Courant'' [Connecticut], W.

Bush and congressional leaders agreed to avoid major changes to the budget for [[fiscal year#United States|fiscal year]] 1990, which began in October 1989. However, both sides knew that spending cuts or new taxes would be necessary in the following year's budget in order to avoid the draconian automatic domestic spending cuts required by the [[Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt; Bush and other leaders also wanted to cut deficits because Federal Reserve Chair [[Alan Greenspan]] refused to lower interest rates, and thus stimulate economic growth, unless the federal budget deficit was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 409–410&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released in late June 1990, Bush said that he would be open to a deficit reduction program which included spending cuts, incentives for economic growth, budget process reform, as well as tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Balz| first1=Dan| last2=Yang| first2=John E.| title=Bush Abandons Campaign Pledge, Calls for New Taxes| date=June 27, 1990| work=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/06/27/bush-abandons-campaign-pledge-calls-for-new-taxes/a7ea302f-cecb-43b0-8d8e-5009bc294ee3/?noredirect=on| access-date=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]] in the Republican Party, Bush's statement represented a betrayal, and they heavily criticized him for compromising so early in the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heclo |first=Hugh |editor1-last=Nelson |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Perry |editor2-first=Barbara A. |title=41: Inside the Presidency of George H.

In September 1990, Bush and Congressional Democrats announced a compromise to cut funding for mandatory and discretionary programs while also raising revenue, partly through a higher gas tax. The compromise additionally included a [[PAYGO|"pay as you go"]] provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation.&lt;ref name="greene100104"&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 100–104&lt;/ref&gt; House Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] led the conservative opposition to the bill, strongly opposing any form of tax increase.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 446–447&lt;/ref&gt; Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise, and in October, the House rejected the deal, resulting in a brief government shutdown. Without the strong backing of the Republican Party, Bush agreed to another compromise bill, this one more favorable to Democrats. The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90), enacted on October 27, 1990, dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners. It included cuts to domestic spending, but the cuts were not as deep as those that had been proposed in the original compromise. Bush's decision to sign the bill damaged his standing with conservatives and the general public, but it also laid the groundwork for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[disability|disabled]] had not received legal protections under the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and many faced discrimination and segregation by the time Bush took office. In 1988, [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]] and [[Tony Coelho]] had introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act, which barred employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. The bill had passed the Senate but not the House, and it was reintroduced in 1989. Though some conservatives opposed the bill due to its costs and potential burdens on businesses, Bush strongly supported it, partly because his son, Neil, had struggled with [[dyslexia]]. After the bill passed both houses of Congress, Bush signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] into law in July 1990.&lt;ref name="greene9092"&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 90–92&lt;/ref&gt; The act required employers and public accommodations to make "reasonable accommodations" for the disabled, while providing an exception when such accommodations imposed an "undue hardship".&lt;ref name="griffin1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffin|first1=Rodman|title=The Disabilities Act|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1991122700|access-date=August 25, 2016|publisher=CQPress|date=December 27, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] later led the congressional passage of a separate civil rights bill designed to facilitate launching employment discrimination lawsuits.&lt;ref name="greene7980"&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In vetoing the bill, Bush argued that it would lead to racial quotas in hiring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Devroy|Devroy, Ann]].

In June 1989, the Bush administration proposed a bill to amend the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. Working with Senate Majority Leader [[George J.

==== Points of Light ====
{{Main|Points of Light}}

President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "[[thousand points of light]]" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."&lt;ref name="President's Report"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation|publisher=Executive Office of the President, 1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cH8vlwSAjv0C|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Bush honored numerous volunteers with the Daily Point of Light Award, a tradition that was continued by his presidential successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Haven |first1=Stephanie |title=Obama, Bush present 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award for volunteers |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-bush-present-5000th-daily-point-of-light-award-for-volunteers/ |work=CBS News |date=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of [[volunteerism]].&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Suzanne|title=After Two Tough Years, New Points of Light Charity Emerges|journal=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=October 15, 2009|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/After-Two-Tough-Years-New/57753/|access-date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the [[Hands On Network]] to create a new organization, [[Points of Light]].&lt;ref name=Edward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edward|first=Deborah|title=Getting to Yes: The Points of Light and Hands On Network Merger|journal=RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service, the University of Texas at Austin|year=2008|url=http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf|access-date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clarence Thomas official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|Bush appointed [[Clarence Thomas]] to the Supreme Court in 1991]]

Bush appointed two justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In 1990, Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge, [[David Souter]], to replace liberal icon [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]].&lt;ref name="souter1"/&gt; Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009, but joined the liberal bloc of the court, disappointing Bush.&lt;ref name="souter1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crawford Greenburg|first1=Jan|title=Supreme Court Justice Souter to Retire|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/SCOTUS/story?id=7477791&amp;page=1|access-date=August 24, 2016|work=ABC News|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Bush nominated conservative federal judge [[Clarence Thomas]] to succeed [[Thurgood Marshall]], a long-time liberal stalwart. Thomas, the former head of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC), [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|faced heavy opposition]] in the Senate, as well as from [[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice groups]] and the [[NAACP]]. His nomination faced another difficulty when [[Anita Hill]] accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC. Thomas won confirmation in a narrow 52–48 vote; 43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas's nomination, while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas became one of the most conservative justices of his era.&lt;ref name="ntotenberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Totenberg|first1=Nina|title=Clarence Thomas' Influence On The Supreme Court|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/11/141246695/clarence-thomas-influence-on-the-court|access-date=August 24, 2016|publisher=NPR|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989]], which incorporated most of Bush's proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Greene (2015), pp. 97–100&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elite level, a number of commentators and political experts deplored the state of American politics in 1991–1992, and reported the voters were angry. Many analysts blamed the poor quality of national election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Troy,  "Stumping in the bookstores: A literary history of the 1992 presidential campaign."

=== 1992 presidential campaign ===
{{main|George H. W. Bush 1992 presidential campaign}}

Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, Bush's reelection initially looked likely.&lt;ref name="skornacki"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kornacki|first1=Steve|title=What if Mario Cuomo had run for president?|url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-if-mario-cuomo-had-run-president|access-date=August 25, 2016|publisher=MSNBC|date=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many leading Democrats, including [[Mario Cuomo]], [[Dick Gephardt]], and [[Al Gore]], declined to seek their party's presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman (1996), pp. 337–338&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bush's tax increase had angered many conservatives, who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt; He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992 Republican primaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Bush fended off Buchanan's challenge and won his party's nomination at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], but the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1992.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|Bush was defeated in the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] by [[Bill Clinton]]]]

Meanwhile, the Democrats nominated Governor [[Bill Clinton]] of Arkansas. A moderate who was affiliated with the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), Clinton favored welfare reform, deficit reduction, and a tax cut for the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire [[H. Ross Perot]] launched a third party bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient. His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Perot Vote|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|access-date=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot also attacked NAFTA, which he claimed would lead to major job losses.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; National polling taken in mid-1992 showed Perot in the lead, but Clinton experienced a surge through effective campaigning and the selection of Senator Al Gore, a popular and relatively young Southerner, as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 504–506&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton won the election, taking 43 percent of the popular vote and 370 electoral votes, while Bush won 37.5 percent of the popular vote and 168 electoral votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|website=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot won 19% of the popular vote, one of the [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections|highest totals for a third-party candidate]] in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Steven A. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1F3FF936A35752C1A964958260 |title=The 1992 Elections: Disappointment – News Analysis – An Eccentric but No Joke; Perot's Strong Showing Raises Questions On What Might Have Been, and Might Be – |work=The New York Times |date=November 5, 1992 |access-date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton performed well in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West Coast, while also waging the strongest Democratic campaign in the South since the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson (2005), pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors were important in Bush's defeat.

Despite his defeat, Bush left office with a 56 percent job approval rating in January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/DailyNews/poll%5Fclintonlegacy010117.html|title=Poll: Clinton Legacy Mixed|author=Langer, Gary|work=ABC News|date=January 17, 2001|access-date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his predecessors, Bush issued a [[List of people pardoned by George H. W. Bush|series of pardons]] during his last days in office. In December 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former senior government officials implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal, most prominently former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]].&lt;ref name="scientists"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |title=Bush pardons Weinberger, Five Other Tied to Iran-Contra |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150512/http://www.fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |archive-date=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against the six were that they lied to or withheld information from Congress. The pardons effectively brought an end to the Iran-Contra scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Levin, and Henry Hyde, "The Iran-Contra Pardons-Was It Wrong for Ex-President Bush to Pardon Six Defendants." ''American Bar Association Journal''  79 (1993): 44-45. Levin says yes, Hyde says no.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A rare event was the a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, "The significance of the 1992 election."

Bush supported his son's candidacy in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], but did not actively campaign in the election and did not deliver a speech at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), pp. 552–555&lt;/ref&gt; George W. Bush defeated Al Gore in the 2000 election and was re-elected in 2004.

Biographer Jon Meacham writes that, after he left office, many Americans viewed Bush as "a gracious and underappreciated man who had many virtues but who had failed to project enough of a distinctive identity and vision to overcome the economic challenges of 1991–92 and to win a second term."&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 567&lt;/ref&gt; Bush himself noted that his legacy was "lost between the glory of Reagan ... and the trials and tribulations of my sons."&lt;ref&gt;Meacham (2015), p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, Bush was fondly remembered for his willingness to compromise, which contrasted with the intensely partisan era that followed his presidency.&lt;ref name="jshesol1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Shesol|first1=Jeff|title=What George H.

Bush's life and legacy |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/01/live-former-president-george-h-w-bushs-life-and-legacy/2173047002/ |newspaper=USA Today|date=December 1, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Beschloss]] and [[Strobe Talbott]] praise Bush's handling of the USSR, especially how he prodded Gorbachev in terms of releasing control over the [[satellite state]]s and permitting German unification—and especially a united Germany in NATO.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Beschloss and Strobe Talbott, ''At the Highest Levels: The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War''  (Boston, 1993), pp. 470-72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Bacevich]] judges the Bush administration as “morally obtuse” in the light of its “business-as-usual” attitude towards China after the massacre in [[Tiananmen Square]] and its uncritical support of Gorbachev as the Soviet Union disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Bacevich, ''American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of U.S. Diplomacy'' (2002), 64–68,  quoted in Sparrow, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; David Rothkopf argues:
:In the recent history of U.S. foreign policy, there has been no president, nor any president’s team, who, when confronted with profound international change and challenges, responded with such a thoughtful and well-managed foreign policy....[the Bush administration was] a bridge over one of the great fault lines of history [that] ushered in a ‘new world order’ it described with great skill and professionalism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Rothkopf|title=Running the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1N1DleUGufwC&amp;pg=PA261|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|page=261|isbn=9780786736003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
