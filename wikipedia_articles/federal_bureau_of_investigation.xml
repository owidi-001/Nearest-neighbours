The '''Federal Bureau of Investigation''' ('''FBI''') is the domestic [[Intelligence agency|intelligence]] and [[Security agency|security]] service of the United States and its principal [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agency]]. Operating under the jurisdiction of the [[United States Department of Justice]], the FBI is also a member of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] and reports to both the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and the [[Director of National Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="intel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intelligence.gov/mission/member-agencies.html |title=Our Strength Lies in Who We Are |publisher=intelligence.gov |access-date=August 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810180812/http://www.intelligence.gov/mission/member-agencies.html |archive-date=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading U.S. [[counter-terrorism]], [[counterintelligence]], and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has [[jurisdiction]] over violations of more than 200 categories of [[Federal crime in the United States|federal crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/how-does-the-fbi-differ-from-the-drug-enforcement-administration-dea-and-the-bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-firearms-and-explosives-atf |title=How does the FBI differ from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)? |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |access-date=November 2, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904013109/https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/how-does-the-fbi-differ-from-the-drug-enforcement-administration-dea-and-the-bureau-of-alcohol-tobacco-firearms-and-explosives-atf |archive-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quickfacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/quickfacts.htm |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation – Quick Facts |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017083929/http://www2.fbi.gov/quickfacts.htm |archive-date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the FBI's functions are unique, its activities in support of [[national security]] are comparable to those of the British [[MI5]] and the Russian [[Federal Security Service|FSB]]. Unlike the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad, the FBI is primarily a domestic agency, maintaining 56 [[List of FBI field offices|field offices]] in major cities throughout the United States, and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation. At an FBI field office, a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the [[Director of National Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2015 Statement Before the House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623212212/https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2015 |date=June 23, 2016}}, Federal Bureau of Investigation, March 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-gets-a-broader-role-in-coordinating-domestic-intelligence-activities/2012/06/19/gJQAtmupoV_story.html FBI gets a broader role in coordinating domestic intelligence activities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716094314/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-gets-a-broader-role-in-coordinating-domestic-intelligence-activities/2012/06/19/gJQAtmupoV_story.html |date=July 16, 2017}}, ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its domestic focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, operating 60 Legal Attache (LEGAT) offices and 15 sub-offices in [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. embassies and consulates]] across the globe. These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/international_operations/overview Overview of the Legal Attaché Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313042943/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/international_operations/overview |date=March 13, 2016}}, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Retrieved: March 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6973534/ns/us_news-security/t/spies-clash-fbi-joins-cia-overseas/ Spies Clash as FBI Joins CIA Overseas: Sources Talk of Communication Problem in Terrorism Role] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418233508/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6973534/ns/us_news-security/t/spies-clash-fbi-joins-cia-overseas/ |date=April 18, 2015}}, [[Associated Press]] via [[NBC News]], February 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; just as the CIA has a [[National Resources Division|limited domestic function]]; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies.

The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the BOI or BI for short. Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2006/march/fbiname_022406|title=A Byte Out of History – How the FBI Got Its Name|website=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI headquarters is the [[J. Edgar Hoover Building]], located in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
===Background===
In 1896, the [[National Bureau of Criminal Identification]] was founded, which provided agencies across the country with information to identify known criminals. The [[Assassination of William McKinley|1901 assassination of President]] [[William McKinley]] created a perception that the United States was under threat from [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchists]]. The Departments of Justice and [[Department of Labor|Labor]] had been keeping records on anarchists for years, but President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] wanted more power to monitor them.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch2&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|author-link=Tim Weiner|title=Enemies a history of the FBI|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-64389-0|edition=1|chapter=Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2020}}

The Justice Department had been tasked with [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887|the regulation of interstate commerce]] since 1887, though it lacked the staff to do so. It had made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the [[Oregon land fraud scandal]] at the turn of the 20th century. President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General [[Charles Joseph Bonaparte|Charles Bonaparte]] to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]].&lt;ref name=FindlayMemo1943&gt;{{cite web |last=Findlay |first=James G. |title=Memorandum for the Director: Re: Early History of the Bureau of Investigation, United States Department of Justice |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/brief-history/docs_findlay43 |work=Historical Documents from the Bureau's Founding |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |access-date=August 14, 2012 |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=November 19, 1943 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703063000/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/brief-history/docs_findlay43 |archive-date=July 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonaparte reached out to other agencies, including the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], for personnel, investigators in particular. On May 27, 1908, Congress forbade this use of Treasury employees by the Justice Department, citing fears that the new agency would serve as a [[secret police]] department.&lt;ref name=AGreport1908&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonaparte |first=Charles Joseph |title=Annual Report of the Attorney General of the United States, 1908, p.7 |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/brief-history/docs_ar1908 |work=Historical Documents from the Bureau's Founding |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |access-date=August 14, 2012 |author-link=Charles Joseph Bonaparte |quote=In my last annual report I called attention to the fact that this department was obliged to call upon the Treasury Department for detective service, and had, in fact, no permanent executive force directly under its orders. Through the prohibition of its further use of the Secret Service force, contained in the Sundry Civil Appropriation Act, approved May 27, 1908, it became necessary for the department to organize a small force of special agents of its own. Although such action was involuntary on the part of this department, the consequences of the innovation have been, on the whole, moderately satisfactory. The Special Agents, placed as they are under the direct orders of the Chief Examiner, who receives from them daily reports and summarizes these each day to the Attorney General, are directly controlled by this department, and the Attorney General knows or ought to know, at all times what they are doing and at what cost. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510200311/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/brief-history/docs_ar1908 |archive-date=May 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again at Roosevelt's urging, Bonaparte moved to organize a formal '''Bureau of Investigation''', which would then have its own staff of [[Special agent (United States)|special agents]].&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch2 /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2020}}

===Creation of BOI===
The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was created on July 26, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fbi-founded|title=FBI founded|website=HISTORY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney General Bonaparte, using Department of Justice expense funds,&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch2 /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2020}} hired thirty-four people, including some veterans of the Secret Service,&lt;ref name = "historicdates" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langeluttig-p9"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Department of Justice of the United States |author=Langeluttig, Albert |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |year=1927 |pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to work for a new investigative agency. Its first "Chief" (the title is now "Director") was [[Stanley Finch]]. Bonaparte notified the Congress of these actions in December 1908.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch2 /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2020}}

The bureau's first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the "White Slave Traffic Act" or [[Mann Act]], passed on June 25, 1910. In 1932, the bureau was renamed the United States Bureau of Investigation.

===Creation of FBI===
The following year, 1933, the BOI was linked to the [[Bureau of Prohibition]] and rechristened the Division of Investigation (DOI); it became an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935.&lt;ref name="historicdates"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/intelligence/timeline |title=Timeline of FBI History |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |access-date=March 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316145041/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/intelligence/timeline/ |archive-date=March 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

===J. Edgar Hoover as FBI Director===
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|thumb|J. Edgar Hoover, FBI Director from 1924 to 1972]]

[[J. Edgar Hoover]] served as FBI Director from 1924 to 1972, a combined 48 years with the BOI, DOI, and FBI. He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the [[FBI Laboratory]], which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government. Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure. But as detailed below, his proved to be a highly controversial tenure as Bureau Director, especially in its later years. After Hoover's death, Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years.

Early homicide investigations of the new agency included the [[Osage Indian murders]]. During the "War on Crime" of the 1930s, FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who committed kidnappings, bank robberies, and murders throughout the nation, including [[John Dillinger]], [[Baby Face Nelson|"Baby Face" Nelson]], [[Ma Barker|Kate "Ma" Barker]], [[Alvin Karpis|Alvin "Creepy" Karpis]], and [[Machine Gun Kelly|George "Machine Gun" Kelly]].

Other activities of its early decades focused on the scope and influence of the white supremacist group [[Ku Klux Klan]], a group with which the FBI was evidenced to be working in the [[Viola Liuzzo]] lynching case. Earlier, through the work of [[Edwin Atherton]], the BOI claimed to have successfully apprehended an entire army of Mexican neo-revolutionaries under the leadership of General Enrique Estrada in the mid-1920s, east of San Diego, California.

Hoover began using [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] in the 1920s during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] to arrest bootleggers.&lt;ref name="hnn"&gt;{{cite news |title=Civil Rights: Let 'Em Wiretap! |last=Greenberg |first=David |author-link=David Greenberg (historian)|date=October 22, 2001 |publisher=History News Network |url=http://hnn.us/articles/366.html |access-date=February 15, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301212237/http://hnn.us/articles/366.html |archive-date=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1927 case ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping.&lt;ref name="hnn" /&gt; After Prohibition's repeal, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Communications Act of 1934]], which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but did allow bugging.&lt;ref name="hnn" /&gt; In the 1939 case ''Nardone v. United States'', the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court.&lt;ref name="hnn" /&gt; After ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967) overturned ''Olmstead'', Congress passed the [[Omnibus Crime Control Act]], allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations, as long as they obtained warrants beforehand.&lt;ref name="hnn" /&gt;

====National security====
Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, the bureau investigated cases of [[espionage]] against the United States and its allies. Eight [[Nazism|Nazi]] agents who had planned [[sabotage]] operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'') under their sentences. Also during this time, a joint US/UK code-breaking effort called "The [[Venona project|Venona Project]]"—with which the FBI was heavily involved—broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications. This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref name="nsa"&gt;{{cite web |last=Benson |first=Robert L. |url=http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00039.cfm |title=The Venona Story |publisher=National Security Agency |access-date=June 18, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614231955/http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00039.cfm&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover was administering this project, but he failed to notify the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) of it until 1952. Another notable case was the arrest of Soviet spy [[Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher|Rudolf Abel]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romerstein |first1=Herbert |last2=Breindel |first2=Eric |title=The Venona Secrets, Exposing Soviet Espionage and America's Traitors |publisher=Regnery Publishing, Inc. |year=2001 |isbn=0-89526-225-8 |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the [[American Left]], ranging from [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA) union organizers to American liberals.

====Japanese American internment====
In 1939, the Bureau began compiling a [[FBI Index#Custodial Detention Index|custodial detention list]] with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations. The majority of the names on the list belonged to [[Issei]] community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence]] index that had focused on [[Japanese American]]s in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many [[Internment of German Americans|German]] and [[Internment of Italian Americans|Italian]] nationals also found their way onto the [[FBI Index]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kashima |first=Tetsuden |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Custodial_detention_/_A-B-C_list/ |title=Custodial detention / A-B-C list |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 21, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020034626/http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Custodial_detention_/_A-B-C_list/ |archive-date=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=Niiya-FBI&gt;{{cite web |last=Niiya |first=Brian |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation/ |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation |publisher=Densho Encyclopledia |access-date=August 21, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020035117/http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation/ |archive-date=October 20, 2014 }}{{Better source needed|date=May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/history/ |title=About the Incarceration |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 21, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813044546/http://encyclopedia.densho.org/history/ |archive-date=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 19, 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/J._Edgar_Hoover/|title=J.

After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.&lt;ref name=Niiya-FBI/&gt;

====Sex deviates program====
According to Douglas M. Charles, the FBI's "sex deviates" program began on April 10, 1950, when J. Edgar Hoover forwarded to the White House, to the U.S. Civil Service Commission, and to branches of the armed services a list of 393 alleged federal employees who had allegedly been arrested in Washington, D.C., since 1947, on charges of "sexual irregularities". On June 20, 1951, Hoover expanded the program by issuing a memo establishing a "uniform policy for the handling of the increasing number of reports and allegations concerning present and past employees of the United States Government who assertedly [sic] are sex deviates." The program was expanded to include non-government jobs. According to [[Athan Theoharis]], "In 1951 he [Hoover] had unilaterally instituted a Sex Deviates program to purge alleged homosexuals from any position in the federal government, from the lowliest clerk to the more powerful position of White house aide." On May 27, 1953, [[Executive Order 10450]] went into effect. The program was expanded further by this executive order by making all federal employment of homosexuals illegal. On July 8, 1953, the FBI forwarded to the U.S. Civil Service Commission information from the sex deviates program. In 1977–1978, 300,000 pages, collected between 1930 and the mid-1970s, in the sex deviates program were destroyed by FBI officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1950-1959|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204172602/http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1950-1959|title=FBI and Homosexuality: 1950–1959 · FBI and Homosexuality Chronology · OutHistory: It's About Time|archive-date=December 4, 2017|website=outhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1970-1979|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032719/http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/1970-1979|title=FBI and Homosexuality: 1970–1979 · FBI and Homosexuality Chronology · OutHistory: It's About Time|archive-date=June 5, 2018|website=outhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/2010-2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171135/http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/fbi-history/2010-2019|title=FBI and Homosexuality: 2010–2019 · FBI and Homosexuality Chronology · OutHistory: It's About Time|archive-date=December 4, 2017|website=outhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil rights movement====
During the 1950s and 1960s, FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or "[[fellow traveller]]s." In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. [[T. R. M. Howard]], a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of [[George W. Lee]], [[Emmett Till]], and other blacks in the South.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, ''Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'' (Urbana: [[University of Illinois Press]], 2009), 148, 154–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI carried out controversial [[surveillance|domestic surveillance]] in an operation it called the [[COINTELPRO]], from '''"CO'''unter-'''INTEL'''ligence '''PRO'''gram."&lt;ref name="coinpro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.net/monitor/9905a/jbcointelpro.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000118104808/http://www.monitor.net/monitor/9905a/jbcointelpro.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 18, 2000 |title=A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO |publisher=Monitor.net |access-date=June 6, 2006 |last=Cassidy |first=Mike M. |date=May 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States, including both militant and non-violent organizations. Among its targets was the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], a leading civil rights organization whose clergy leadership included the Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who is addressed in more detail below.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0308-27.htm |title=A Break-In to End All Break-Ins |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=June 6, 2006 |last=Jalon |first=Allan M. |date=April 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620040020/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0308-27.htm |archive-date=June 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI frequently investigated King. In the mid-1960s, King began to criticize the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists. Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most "notorious liar" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Branch, Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963–1965 (Simon and Schuster, 1999), p. 524-529&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1991 memoir, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' journalist [[Carl Rowan]] asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030502.html|title=Was Martin Luther King, Jr. a plagiarist?|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=June 6, 2006|author-link=Cecil Adams|last=Adams|first=Cecil M.|date=May 2, 2003|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110718163413/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/030502.html|archive-date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Taylor Branch]] documents an anonymous November 1964 "suicide package" sent by the Bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him "You are done.

In March 1971, the residential office of an FBI agent in [[Media, Pennsylvania]] was burgled by a group calling itself the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]]. Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers, including ''[[The Harvard Crimson]].''&lt;ref name="'70s 2"&gt;{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/40 40]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The files detailed the FBI's extensive [[COINTELPRO]] program, which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens—including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman [[Henry S. Reuss]] of [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="'70s 2" /&gt; The country was "jolted" by the revelations, which included assassinations of political activists, and the actions were denounced by members of the Congress, including House Majority Leader [[Hale Boggs]].&lt;ref name="'70s 2" /&gt; The phones of some members of the Congress, including Boggs, had allegedly been tapped.&lt;ref name="'70s 2" /&gt;

====Kennedy's assassination====
When President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot and killed, the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] directed the FBI to take over the investigation.&lt;ref name="history_postwar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postwar.htm |title=Postwar America: 1945–1960s |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106195659/http://www2.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postwar.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure clarity about the responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials, the Congress passed a law that included investigations of such deaths of federal officials, especially by homicide, within FBI jurisdiction.

===Organized crime===
[[File:Donnie Brasco.jpg|thumb|An FBI surveillance photograph of [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (aka Donnie Brasco), [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Benjamin "Lefty" Ruggiero]] and [[Edgar Robb]] (aka Tony Rossi), 1980s]]
In response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program. The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm "Using Intel to Stop the Mob, Part 2"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616042610/https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm |date=June 16, 2010 }}. Retrieved February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]], or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups. Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a [[National Crime Syndicate]] in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by [[Sam Giancana]] and [[John Gotti]]. The RICO Act is still used today for all [[organized crime]] and any individuals who may fall under the Act's provisions.

In 2003, a congressional committee called the FBI's organized crime [[informant]] program "one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement."&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the [[Joseph Barboza#False testimony against rivals|March 1965 gangland murder of Edward "Teddy" Deegan]] in order to protect [[Stephen Flemmi|Vincent Flemmi]], an FBI informant. Three of the men were sentenced to death (which was later reduced to life in prison), and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;

In July 2007, U.S. District Judge [[Nancy Gertner]] in Boston found that the Bureau had helped convict the four men using false witness accounts given by mobster [[Joseph Barboza]]. The U.S. Government was ordered to pay $100&amp;nbsp;million in damages to the four defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Special FBI teams===
[[File:FBI SWAT team Watervliet Arsenal.jpg|thumb|right| FBI [[SWAT]] agents in a training exercise]]
In 1982, the FBI formed an elite unit&lt;ref name="history_rise"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/rise.htm |title=Rise in International Crime |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106201333/http://www2.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/rise.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to help with problems that might arise at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] to be held in Los Angeles, particularly [[terrorism]] and major-crime. This was a result of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich|Munich, Germany]], when [[Munich massacre|terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes]]. Named the [[Hostage Rescue Team]], or HRT, it acts as a dedicated FBI [[SWAT]] team dealing primarily with counter-terrorism scenarios. Unlike the Special Agents serving on local [[FBI SWAT]] teams, HRT does not conduct investigations. Instead, HRT focuses solely on additional tactical proficiency and capabilities. Also formed in 1984 was the ''Computer Analysis and Response Team'', or CART.&lt;ref name="history_coldwarend"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postcold.htm |title=End of the Cold War |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106195651/http://www2.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/postcold.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s, the FBI reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter-intelligence duties to violent crime, and made violent crime the sixth national priority. With cuts to other well-established departments, and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref name="history_coldwarend" /&gt; the FBI assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines, which is a federal offense. The FBI Laboratory helped develop [[DNA]] testing, continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924.

===Notable efforts in the 1990s===

On May 1, 1992, FBI SWAT and HRT personnel in [[Los Angeles County, California]] aided local officials in securing peace within the area during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. HRT operators, for instance, spent 10 days conducting vehicle-mounted patrols throughout [[Los Angeles]], before returning to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cms.sofrep.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-unofficial-history-of-the-fbi-hostage-rescue-team.pdf|title=Anything, Anytime, Anywhere: The Unofficial History of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, Page 10/25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1993 and 1996, the FBI increased its [[counter-terrorism]] role following the first [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] in [[New York City]], the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], and the arrest of the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]] in 1996. Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted.&lt;ref name="history_wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/wiredworld.htm |title=Rise of a Wired World |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106195709/http://www2.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/wiredworld.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the [[Ruby Ridge]] and [[Waco siege|Waco]] incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]]. It has settled a dispute with [[Richard Jewell]], who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations,&lt;ref name="leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medialibel.org/cases-conflicts/tv/jewell.html |title=Richard Jewell v. NBC, and other Richard Jewell cases |publisher=Media Libel |access-date=June 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527200834/http://medialibel.org/cases-conflicts/tv/jewell.html |archive-date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing.

After Congress passed the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA, 1994), the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA, 1996), and the [[Economic Espionage Act]] (EEA, 1996), the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, just as it did with its CART team in 1991. Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center (CITAC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) were created to deal with the increase in [[Internet]]-related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened U.S. operations. With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.

===September 11 attacks===
[[File:9-11 Pentagon Emergency Response 3.jpg|thumb|September 11 attacks at the Pentagon]]
During the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], FBI agent [[Leonard W. Hatton Jr.]] was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the South Tower, and he stayed when it collapsed. Within months after the attacks, FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]], who had been sworn in a week before the attacks, called for a re-engineering of FBI structure and operations. He made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cybersecurity threats, other high-tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white-collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.&lt;ref name="history_current"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/changeman.htm |title=Change of Mandate |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106195636/http://www2.fbi.gov/libref/historic/history/changeman.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, [[Robert Hanssen]] was caught selling information to the Russian government. It was later learned that Hanssen, who had reached a high position within the FBI, had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979. He pleaded guilty to [[espionage]] and received a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] in 2002, but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI. There was also a claim that Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September 11, 2001 attacks.&lt;ref name="9_11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk|title=Osama access to state secrets helped 9/11|publisher=Computer Crime Research Center|access-date=June 6, 2006|last=Seper|first=Jerry|archive-date=June 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608124653/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission]]'s final report on July 22, 2004, stated that the FBI and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11 attacks. In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had "not been well served" by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1160100.htm|title=9/11 Commission finds 'deep institutional failings'|publisher=ABC Au|last=Shovelan|first=John|date=June 23, 2004|access-date=June 6, 2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221224609/http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1160100.htm|archive-date=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the FBI did accede to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new [[Director of National Intelligence]], some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/06/60minutes/main923095.shtml|title=Ex-FBI Chief On Clinton's Scandals|work=CBS News|date=October 6, 2004|access-date=June 6, 2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614142823/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/06/60minutes/main923095.shtml|archive-date=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published excerpts from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Professor Amy Zegart's book ''Spying Blind: The CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9/11.''&lt;ref name="cis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.spa.ucla.edu/zegart/tableofcontent.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013114822/http://faculty.spa.ucla.edu/zegart/tableofcontent.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 13, 2007|title=Spying Blind|publisher=Princeton University Press|access-date=July 8, 2007|last=Zegart|first=Amy|date=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Post'' reported, from Zegart's book, that government documents showed that both the CIA and the FBI had missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA, and the rest of the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change. For example, FBI personnel practices continued to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying [[intelligence analysis|intelligence analysts]] alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.&lt;ref name="wpz"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070602004.html|title=Our Clueless Intelligence System|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=July 8, 2007|last=Zegart|first=Amy|date=July 8, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713075345/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070602004.html|archive-date=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faulty bullet analysis===
For over 40 years, the FBI crime lab in Quantico had believed that lead alloys used in bullets had unique chemical signatures. It was analyzing the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets. The [[National Academy of Sciences]] conducted an 18-month independent review of [[comparative bullet-lead analysis]]. In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony. It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed, and the conclusion, that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition, was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence. One year later, the FBI decided to stop conducting bullet lead analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI Laboratory Announces Discontinuation of Bullet Lead Examinations|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-laboratory-announces-discontinuation-of-bullet-lead-examinations|website=fbi.gov|publisher=FBI National Press Office|access-date=December 6, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208182140/http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-laboratory-announces-discontinuation-of-bullet-lead-examinations|archive-date=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a ''[[60 Minutes]]''/''[[Washington Post]]'' investigation in November 2007, two years later, the Bureau agreed to identify, review, and release all pertinent cases, and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Counterterrorism Policy Directive and Policy Guide (redacted).pdf|thumb|Redacted policy guide for the Counterterrorism Division (part of the [[FBI National Security Branch|FBI&amp;nbsp;National&amp;nbsp;Security&amp;nbsp;Branch]])]]

The FBI is organized into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices. An executive assistant director manages each branch. Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions, each headed by an assistant director. The various divisions are further divided into sub-branches, led by deputy assistant directors. Within these sub-branches, there are various sections headed by section chiefs. Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge. Four of the branches report to the deputy director while two report to the associate director.

The main branches of the FBI are:&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Leadership &amp; Structure|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure|access-date=2021-01-08|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal authority==
[[File:FBI Badge &amp; gun.jpg|thumb|FBI badge and service pistol, a [[Glock]] Model 22, .40 S&amp;W caliber]]

The FBI's mandate is established in [[Title 28 of the United States Code]] (U.S. Code), Section 533, which authorizes the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to "appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States."&lt;ref name="uscode"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/533- |title=US CODE: Title 28,533. Investigative and other officials; appointment |publisher=Cornell Law School |access-date=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes.

The FBI's chief tool against [[organized crime]] is the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] (RICO) Act. The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ). The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) in the enforcement of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.

The [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] increased the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] and monitoring of Internet activity. One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so-called ''[[Sneak and peek warrant|sneak and peek]]'' provision, granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away, and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterward. Under the PATRIOT Act's provisions, the FBI also resumed inquiring into the [[library]] records&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Egelko |author2=Maria Alicia Gaura |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/10/MN14634.DTL |title=Libraries post Patriot Act warnings: Santa Cruz branches tell patrons that FBI may spy on them |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 10, 2003 |access-date=February 15, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429204950/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2003%2F03%2F10%2FMN14634.DTL |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of those who are suspected of [[terrorism]] (something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s).

In the early 1980s, Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the [[Abscam]] controversy, which had allegations of [[entrapment]] of elected officials. As a result, in the following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities.

A March 2007 report by the inspector general of the Justice Department described the FBI's "widespread and serious misuse" of [[national security letter]]s, a form of [[administrative subpoena]] used to demand records and data pertaining to individuals. The report said that between 2003 and 2005, the FBI had issued more than 140,000 national security letters, many involving people with no obvious connections to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnlede.t.html|title= Who's Watching the F.B.I.?|author= Jeffrey Rosen|work= The New York Times Magazine |date= April 15, 2007|access-date= February 15, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512180735/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnlede.t.html|archive-date= May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] or Department of Justice official, who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted.

The FBI often works in conjunction with other federal agencies, including the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] (USCG) and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) in seaport and airport security,&lt;ref name="sea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/FBI/a0626/final.pdf |title=The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Efforts to Protect the Nation's Seaports |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General |date=March 2006 |access-date=February 15, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001020122/http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/FBI/a0626/final.pdf |archive-date=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] in investigating [[Aviation accidents and incidents|airplane crashes]] and other critical incidents. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has nearly the same amount of investigative manpower as the FBI and investigates the largest range of crimes. In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], then-Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]].

The FBI also maintains over 400 resident agencies across the United States, as well as over 50 legal attachés at United States [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] and [[Consul (representative)|consulates]]. Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in [[Quantico, Virginia]], as well as a "data campus" in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]], where 96&amp;nbsp;million sets of fingerprints "from across the United States are stored, along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]], [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]."&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;[[Dana Priest|Priest, Dana]] and [[William Arkin|Arkin, William]] (December 2010) [http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/3/ Monitoring America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222220450/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/3/ |date=December 22, 2010 }}, ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division, which processes [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests, to [[Winchester, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winchesterstar.com/TheWinchesterStar/060726/Area_fbi.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070223124348/http://www.winchesterstar.com/TheWinchesterStar/060726/Area_fbi.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 23, 2007 |title=One of the biggest things the FBI has ever done |publisher=The Winchester Star |date=July 26, 2006 |author=Reid, Sarah A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the FBI "is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top-secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime.

The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy.

The [[FBI Academy]], located in [[Quantico, Virginia]], is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes. It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI Special Agents. Going through the 21-week course is required for every Special Agent.&lt;ref name="school"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbijobs.gov/113.asp |title=Special Agent Career Path Program |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702114822/http://www.fbijobs.gov/113.asp |archive-date=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First opened for use in 1972, the facility is located on {{convert|385|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of woodland. The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies, which are invited to the law enforcement training center. The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the ''Field and Police Training Unit'', ''Firearms Training Unit'', ''Forensic Science Research and Training Center'', ''Technology Services Unit'' (TSU), ''Investigative Training Unit'', ''Law Enforcement Communication Unit'', ''Leadership and Management Science Units'' (LSMU), ''Physical Training Unit'', ''New Agents' Training Unit'' (NATU), ''Practical Applications Unit'' (PAU), the ''Investigative Computer Training Unit'' and the "College of Analytical Studies."

In 2000, the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated [[information technology]] (IT) infrastructure. This project, originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $380&amp;nbsp;million, ended up over budget and behind schedule.&lt;ref name="vcf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/newszine/Archive/020905/tech/2.htm |title=Lawmakers criticize FBI director's expensive project |publisher=Newszine |access-date=June 6, 2006 |last=Sherman |first=Mark |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830160336/http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/newszine/Archive/020905/tech/2.htm |archive-date=August 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC), were not. [[Virtual Case File]], or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management.&lt;ref name="vcf2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontechnology.com/news/1_1/industry/25335-1.html |title=SAIC rejects Trilogy criticism |publisher=Washington Technology |access-date=June 6, 2006 |last=Gerin |first=Roseanne |date=January 14, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202010045/http://www.washingtontechnology.com/news/1_1/industry/25335-1.html |archive-date=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI officially abandoned the project. At least $100&amp;nbsp;million (and much more by some estimates) was spent on the project, which never became operational. The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade-old Automated Case Support system, which [[information technology|IT]] experts consider woefully inadequate. In March 2005, the FBI announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project, code-named Sentinel, which they expected to complete by 2009.&lt;ref name="sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcw.com/article89707-07-27-05-Web |title=Senators seek to fast track FBI's Sentinel |publisher=FCW.Com |access-date=June 6, 2006 |last=Arnone |first=Michael |date=June 25, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025013430/http://www.fcw.com/article89707-07-27-05-Web |archive-date=October 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications. After prolonged negative coverage in the press, the FBI changed the name of its system from "Carnivore" to "DCS1000." DCS is reported to stand for "Digital Collection System"; the system has the same functions as before. The [[Associated Press]] reported in mid-January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight.

The [[FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division|Criminal Justice Information Services]] (CJIS) Division&lt;ref name="cjis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/about.htm |title=The CJIS Mission |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916145313/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/about.htm |archive-date=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]]. Organized beginning in 1991, the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division. The complex is the length of three football fields. It provides a main repository for information in various data systems. Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the ''National Crime Information Center'' (NCIC), ''Uniform Crime Reporting'' (UCR), ''Fingerprint Identification'', ''Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System'' (IAFIS), ''NCIC 2000'', and the ''National Incident-Based Reporting System'' (NIBRS). Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications. FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies.

===Hiring process===
To apply to become an FBI agent, one must be between the ages of 23 and 37, unless one is a preference-eligible [[veteran]], in which case one may apply after age 37.&lt;ref&gt;Due to the decision in ''Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management'', 2008 M.S.P.B. 146. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision ([http://www.chcoc.gov/Transmittals/TransmittalDetails.aspx?TransmittalID=2484 CHCOC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808110540/http://www.chcoc.gov/Transmittals/TransmittalDetails.aspx?TransmittalID=2484 |date=August 8, 2012 }}. Chcoc.gov. Retrieved on July 23, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant must also hold U.S. citizenship, be of high moral character, have a clean record, and hold at least a four-year [[bachelor's degree]]. At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required. All FBI employees require a Top Secret (TS) [[security clearance]], and in many instances, employees need a TS/SCI ([[Classified information in the United States#Top Secret|'''T'''op '''S'''ecret]]/[[Collateral clearance|'''S'''ensitive '''C'''ompartmented '''I'''nformation]]) clearance.&lt;ref name="tssci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbijobs.gov/5.asp |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation Jobs |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702114028/http://www.fbijobs.gov/5.asp |archive-date=July 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain a security clearance, all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of [[Single Scope Background Investigation]]s (SSBI), which are conducted by the [[United States Office of Personnel Management|Office of Personnel Management]].&lt;ref name="opm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/OBD/e0510/back.htm#12 |title=Review of the Security and Emergency Planning Staff's Management of Background Investigations |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General |date=September 2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816072405/http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/OBD/e0510/back.htm#12 |archive-date=August 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special agent candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test (PFT), which includes a 300-meter run, one-minute sit-ups, maximum push-ups, and a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1|adj=on}} run.

===BOI and FBI directors===
{{Main|Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation}}
[[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Directors]] are [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|appointed]] (nominated) by the [[President of the United States]] and must be confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] to serve a term of office of ten years, subject to resignation or removal by the President at his/her discretion before their term ends. Additional terms are allowed following the same procedure

[[J. Edgar Hoover]], appointed by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation, as part of the ''Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act'' of 1968, requiring Senate confirmation of appointments of future Directors.&lt;ref&gt;''Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act'' {{USPL|90|351}}, June 19, 1968, {{USStat|82|197}}, sec.1101&lt;/ref&gt; As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover. The last FBI Director was [[Andrew McCabe]]. The current FBI Director is [[Christopher A. Wray]] appointed by President [[Donald Trump]].

The FBI director is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the FBI. Along with the [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Deputy Director]], the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly. The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in any one of the FBI [[List of FBI field offices|field offices]] is manned with qualified agents. Before the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the [[President of the United States]] on any issues that arise from within the FBI. Since then, the director now reports to the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.

==Firearms==
[[File:Glock22inOliveDrab.jpg|thumb|A Glock 22 pistol in .40 S&amp;W caliber]]
Upon qualification, an FBI special agent is issued a full-size [[Glock 22]] or compact Glock 23 [[semi-automatic pistol]], both of which are chambered in the [[.40 S&amp;W]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]. In May 1997, the FBI officially adopted the Glock, in .40 S&amp;W, for general agent use, and first issued it to New Agent Class 98-1 in October 1997.

The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement, [[terrorism]], [[Computer crime|cybercrime]], [[white-collar crime]], [[violent crime]], and statistics.&lt;ref name="pubs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/publications.htm |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation – Reports &amp; Publications |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326222038/https://www2.fbi.gov/publications.htm |archive-date=March 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] publications covering these topics are published by the [[Office of Justice Programs]] agencies of the [[United States Department of Justice]], and disseminated through the [[National Criminal Justice Reference Service]].

===Crime statistics===
During the 1920s the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments.&lt;ref name="'70s"&gt;{{cite book |title=How We Got Here: The '70s |last=Frum |first=David |author-link=David Frum |year=2000 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-465-04195-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/12 12] |url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limitations of this system that were discovered during the 1960s and 1970s—victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place—the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] developed an alternative method of tallying crime, the victimization survey.&lt;ref name="'70s" /&gt;

====Uniform Crime Reports====
{{Main|Uniform Crime Reports}}
The Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country. They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest, clearance (or closing a case), and law enforcement officer information. The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes.&lt;ref name="pubs" /&gt; Created in the 1920s, the UCR system has not proven to be as ''uniform'' as its name implies. The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape. Since about 93% of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data.

Preliminary Annual ''Uniform Crime Report'' for 2006 was released on June 4, 2006. The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1.3%, but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2.9% compared to 2005.&lt;ref name="publications_ucr2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/index.html |title=Preliminary Crime Statistics for 2006 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411123900/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/index.html |archive-date=April 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Incident-Based Reporting System====
{{Main|National Incident-Based Reporting System}}
The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) [[crime statistics]] system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. {{as of|2004|df=US}}, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.

==eGuardian==
eGuardian is the name of an FBI system, launched in January 2009, to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies. The program aims to get law enforcement at all levels sharing data quickly about suspicious activity and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/13/national/main4719968.shtml|title=FBI Launches Tip-Sharing For Inauguration|work=[[CBS News]]|date=January 13, 2009|access-date=January 13, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125020820/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/13/national/main4719968.shtml|archive-date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eGuardian enables near real-time sharing and tracking of terror information and suspicious activities with local, state, tribal, and federal agencies. The eGuardian system is a spin-off of a similar but classified tool called Guardian that has been used inside the FBI, and shared with vetted partners since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2009/01/13/e-guardian-fbi-shares-threat-info-with-local-police-agencies/|title=eGuardian – FBI Shares Threat Info With Local Police Agencies|publisher=National Terror Alert Response Center|date=January 13, 2009|access-date=January 13, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114174943/http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2009/01/13/e-guardian-fbi-shares-threat-info-with-local-police-agencies/|archive-date=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Covert operations on political groups''' - Political groups deemed disruptive have been investigated and discredited by the FBI in the aim of "protecting [[national security]], preventing [[violence]], and maintaining the existing [[Social order|social]] and [[Political system|political order]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-11-04|title=U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104062808/http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/churchcommittee.html|access-date=2021-07-20|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of FBI controversies#Files on U.S. citizens|'''Files on U.S. citizens''']] - The Bureau kept files on certain individuals for varying reasons and lengths of time, notably, [[FBI files on Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[John Denver]].

'''[[Robert Hanssen]]''' - In what is described by the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice (DOJ)]] as "[[Robert Hanssen|possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history]].",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=A Review of FBI Security Programs|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fbi/websterreport.html|access-date=2021-07-20|website=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanssen managed to evade the FBI as he simultaneously sold thousands of classified American documents to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[GRU|intelligence operatives]].

'''[[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]]''' - A statement from the FBI confirmed that it had failed to act on a tip warning of the possibility of the shooting over a month prior to its occurrence, which may have prevented the tragedy outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-02-17|title=FBI Statement on the Shooting in Parkland, Florida — FBI|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217004949/https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-the-shooting-in-parkland-florida|access-date=2021-07-20|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internal investigations of shootings''' - A professor of [[criminal justice]] at the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] suggested that FBI internal reports found a questionably high number of [[Shooting|weapon discharges]] by its agents to be justified.

[[Whitey Bulger|'''The Whitey Bulger case''']] - The FBI was, and continues to be, criticized for its handling of [[Boston]] criminal Whitney Bulger.

[[Associated Press|'''Associated Press (AP) impersonation case''']] - A Bureau agent, masquerading as an AP [[journalist]], placed [[Spyware|surveillance software]] in the [[personal computer]] of a minor.

'''FBI surveillance since 2010''' - In the years since 2010, it has been uncovered by various [[civil liberties]] groups (such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union|American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU]]]) that the FBI earmarked disproportionate resources for the surveillance of [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] movements and political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Still Spying on Dissent.pdf|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z-i_XCoZub8ISKEe5DzjoMh0bPS5u1Xm/view?usp=embed_facebook|access-date=2021-07-20|website=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI has also committed several breaches of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=SperiOctober 22, 2019|first=Alice SperiAlice|last2=P.m|first2=4:03|title=The FBI’s Long History of Treating Political Dissent as Terrorism|url=https://theintercept.com/2019/10/22/terrorism-fbi-political-dissent/|access-date=2021-07-20|website=The Intercept|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-12-26|title=US non-profit sues FBI to learn about phone hacking capability|url=https://www.thexyz.com/blog/us-non-profit-sues-fbi-to-learn-about-phone-hacking-capability/|access-date=2021-07-20|website=Thexyz Blog|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''[[Viola Liuzzo]]''' - [[Gary Thomas Rowe]], an FBI informant who at the time was also an active member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], assisted in the murder of Viola Liuzzo (a Caucasian civil rights activist) in 1965, and afterwards, [[Defamation|defamatory]] rumours were spread by the Bureau about the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=May|first=Gary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.12987/yale/9780300106350.001.0001|title=The Informant|date=2005-05-11|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10635-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=WebCite query result|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKqS0VOK?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/30/AR2005063001422_pf.html|access-date=2021-07-20|website=www.webcitation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media portrayal==
{{Main|FBI portrayal in media}}
[[File:Gillian Anderson &amp; David Duchovny (9344570889).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The popular TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' depicts the fictional FBI Special Agents [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) who investigate [[paranormal]] phenomena.]]
The FBI has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s. The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Powers |first=Richard Gid |title=G-Men: Hoover's FBI in American Popular Culture |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=1983 |location=Carbondale, IL |isbn=0-8093-1096-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/gmenhooversfbiin00powe }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the series ''[[The X-Files]]'', which started in 1993 and concluded its eleventh season in early 2018, and concerned investigations into [[paranormal]] phenomena by five fictional Special Agents, and the fictional [[Counter Terrorist Unit]] (CTU) agency in the TV drama ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', which is patterned after the [[FBI Counterterrorism Division]]. The 1991 movie ''[[Point Break (1991 film)|Point Break]]'' depicts an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers. The 1997 movie ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'' is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent [[Joseph D. Pistone]] infiltrating the Mafia. The 2015 TV series ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'', titled after the location of the Bureau's training facility, deals with Probationary and Special Agents, not all of whom, within the show's format, may be fully reliable or even trustworthy.
