&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Cancer''' is a group of diseases involving [[Cell growth#Disorders|abnormal cell growth]] with the potential to [[Invasion (cancer)|invade]] or [[Metastasis|spread]] to other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=WHO2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Defining Cancer |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer |publisher=National Cancer Institute |access-date=28 March 2018 |date=17 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These contrast with [[benign tumor]]s, which do not spread.&lt;ref name=NCI2014/&gt; Possible [[Cancer signs and symptoms|signs and symptoms]] include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained [[weight loss]], and a change in [[defecation|bowel movements]].&lt;ref name=NHS2012&gt;{{cite web |title=Cancer – Signs and symptoms |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cancer/Pages/Symptoms.aspx |website=NHS Choices |access-date=10 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608104550/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cancer/Pages/symptoms.aspx |archive-date=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes.&lt;ref name=NHS2012/&gt; Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.&lt;ref name=NCI2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and Treatment --&gt;
The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake, eating plenty of [[vegetables]], [[fruits]], and [[whole grains]], [[vaccination]] against certain infectious diseases, limiting consumption of [[processed meat]] and [[red meat]], and limiting exposure to direct [[sunlight]].&lt;ref name=Kushi2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kushi LH, Doyle C, McCullough M, Rock CL, Demark-Wahnefried W, Bandera EV, Gapstur S, Patel AV, Andrews K, Gansler T |s2cid=2067308 |title=American Cancer Society Guidelines on nutrition and physical activity for cancer prevention: reducing the risk of cancer with healthy food choices and physical activity |journal= CA Cancer J Clin |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=30–67 |year=2012 |pmid=22237782 |doi=10.3322/caac.20140|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parkin DM, Boyd L, Walker LC |title=16.

==Etymology and definitions==
The word comes from the ancient Greek καρκίνος, meaning ''crab'' and ''tumor''. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted the similarity of crabs to some tumors with swollen veins. The word was introduced in English in the modern medical sense around 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/cancer|title=cancer &amp;#124; Origin and meaning of cancer by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancers comprise a large family of diseases that involve abnormal [[cell growth]] with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=WHO2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI2014/&gt; They form a subset of [[neoplasm]]s. A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.&lt;ref name=ACSglossary&gt;{{cite web |title=Cancer Glossary |website=cancer.org |publisher=American Cancer Society |url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerglossary/index |access-date=11 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901160014/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerglossary/index |archive-date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCIdefinition&gt;{{cite web |title=What is cancer? |website=cancer.gov |publisher=National Cancer Institute |access-date=28 March 2018 |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer|date=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All tumor cells show the [[The Hallmarks of Cancer|six hallmarks of cancer]]. These characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor. They include:&lt;ref name="Han2000" /&gt;
* [[Cell growth|Cell growth and division]] absent the proper signals
* Continuous growth and division even given contrary signals
* Avoidance of [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]
*[[Biological immortality|Limitless number of cell divisions]]
* Promoting [[angiogenesis|blood vessel construction]]
* [[Invasion (cancer)|Invasion]] of tissue and formation of [[metastasis|metastases]]&lt;ref name=Han2000/&gt;

The progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to outright cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression.&lt;ref name=Han2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanahan D, Weinberg RA |s2cid=1478778 |title=The hallmarks of cancer |journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10647931 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9 |author-link1=Douglas Hanahan |author-link2=Robert Weinberg (biologist)|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Han2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanahan D, Weinberg RA |title=Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation |journal=Cell |volume=144 |issue=5 |pages=646–74 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21376230 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Cancer signs and symptoms}}
[[File:Symptoms of cancer metastasis.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Symptoms of cancer [[metastasis]] depend on the location of the tumor.]]
When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerates]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; The findings that result depend on the cancer's type and location.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; Few symptoms are [[non-specific symptom|specific]]. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a "[[the great imitator|great imitator]]."&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt;

People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis.

Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the [[bronchus]] resulting in cough or [[pneumonia]]; [[esophageal cancer]] can cause narrowing of the [[esophagus]], making it difficult or painful to swallow; and [[colorectal cancer]] may lead to narrowing or blockages in the [[bowel]], affecting bowel habits.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; [[ulcer (dermatology)|Ulceration]] can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]] (lung cancer), [[anemia]] or [[Lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]] (colon cancer), [[Hematuria|blood in the urine]] (bladder cancer), or [[abnormal vaginal bleeding]] (endometrial or cervical cancer).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Card10/&gt; --&gt; Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or [[Ascites|abdomen]].&lt;ref name="Card10"&gt;Holland Chp. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic symptoms===
Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body's response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Dell |first=edited by Michael D. Stubblefield, Michael W. |title=Cancer rehabilitation principles and practice |year=2009 |publisher=Demos Medical |location=New York |isbn=978-1-933864-33-4 |page=983 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_JaPlNYgXkEC |page=983}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known as [[cachexia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon K, Strasser F, Anker SD, Bosaeus I, Bruera E, Fainsinger RL, Jatoi A, Loprinzi C, MacDonald N, Mantovani G, Davis M, Muscaritoli M, Ottery F, Radbruch L, Ravasco P, Walsh D, Wilcock A, Kaasa S, Baracos VE | display-authors = 6 | title = Definition and classification of cancer cachexia: an international consensus | journal = The Lancet.

Some systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as [[paraneoplastic syndromes]]. Common paraneoplastic syndromes include [[hypercalcemia]] which can cause [[altered mental state]], constipation and dehydration, or [[hyponatremia]] that can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headache or seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitriadis GK, Angelousi A, Weickert MO, Randeva HS, Kaltsas G, Grossman A | title = Paraneoplastic endocrine syndromes | journal = Endocrine-Related Cancer | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = R173–R190 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28341725 | doi = 10.1530/ERC-17-0036 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metastasis===
{{main|Metastasis}}
[[Metastasis]] is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.&lt;ref name="metastasis"/&gt; Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.&lt;ref name="What is Metastasized Cancer"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Metastasized Cancer? |url=http://www.nccn.com/component/content/article/54-cancer-basics/925-what-is-metastasized-cancer.html |website=National Comprehensive Cancer Network |access-date=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707200430/http://www.nccn.com/component/content/article/54-cancer-basics/925-what-is-metastasized-cancer.html |archive-date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the [[lymphatic system]] or both. The typical steps in metastasis are local [[Invasion (cancer)|invasion]], [[intravasation]] into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, [[extravasation]] into the new tissue, proliferation and [[angiogenesis]]. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the [[lung]]s, [[liver]], brain and the [[bone]]s.&lt;ref name="metastasis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/metastatic-cancer |title=Metastatic Cancer: Questions and Answers |access-date=28 March 2018|publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes do not have specific fingerprints. For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons. Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional [[Organ donation|organ donors]], cancer is generally not a [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]].&lt;ref name=Tolar&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tolar J, Neglia JP |s2cid=34197973 |title=Transplacental and other routes of cancer transmission between individuals |journal=Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=430–4 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12794519 |doi=10.1097/00043426-200306000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heredity===
{{Main|Cancer syndrome}}
The vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (sporadic). [[Hereditary cancer]]s are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect.

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers, such as cancer of the breast, [[endometrium]], prostate, ovary and [[testicle|testis]] and also of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[bone cancer]].&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of [[testosterone]] than men of European ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating [[androstanediol glucuronide]], have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

Other factors are relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Women who take [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; [[Osteosarcoma]] may be promoted by [[growth hormone]]s.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt; Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;

===Autoimmune diseases===
There is an association between [[celiac disease]] and an increased risk of all cancers. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment, probably due to the adoption of a [[gluten-free diet]], which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies.&lt;ref name="pmid26402826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Han Y, Chen W, Li P, Ye J |title=Association Between Coeliac Disease and Risk of Any Malignancy and Gastrointestinal Malignancy: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Medicine |volume=94 |issue=38 |pages=e1612 |date=September 2015 |pmid=26402826 |pmc=4635766 |doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000001612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]], due to chronic inflammation.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Carcinogenesis}}
[[File:Cancer requires multiple mutations from NIHen.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Cancers are caused by a series of mutations. Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell somewhat.]]

===Genetics===
{{Main|Oncogenomics}}
Cancer is fundamentally a disease of tissue growth regulation. In order for a normal cell to [[malignant transformation|transform]] into a cancer cell, the [[gene]]s that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered.&lt;ref name="pmid18234754"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Croce CM |s2cid=8813076 |title=Oncogenes and cancer |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=5 |pages=502–11 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18234754 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra072367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affected genes are divided into two broad categories. [[Oncogene]]s are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction. [[Tumor suppressor gene]]s are genes that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.&lt;ref name="pmid11905807"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knudson AG |s2cid=20201610 |title=Two genetic hits (more or less) to cancer |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=157–62 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11905807 |doi=10.1038/35101031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms. The gain or loss of an entire [[chromosome]] can occur through errors in [[mitosis]]. More common are [[mutation]]s, which are changes in the [[nucleotide]] sequence of genomic DNA.

Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. [[Gene duplication|Genomic amplification]] occurs when a cell gains copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. [[Chromosomal translocation|Translocation]] occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] and results in production of the [[BCR (gene)|BCR]]-[[aBL (gene)|abl]] [[fusion protein]], an oncogenic [[tyrosine kinase]].

Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of a gene and affect its [[gene expression|expression]], or may occur in the gene's [[coding sequence]] and alter the function or stability of its [[protein]] product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from [[provirus|integration of genomic material]] from a [[DNA virus]] or [[retrovirus]], leading to the expression of ''viral'' oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.

Replication of the data contained within the DNA of living cells will [[probability|probabilistically]] result in some errors (mutations). Complex error correction and prevention is built into the process and safeguards the cell against cancer. If a significant error occurs, the damaged cell can self-destruct through programmed cell death, termed [[apoptosis]]. If the error control processes fail, then the mutations will survive and be passed along to [[cell division|daughter cells]].

Some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate. Such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called [[carcinogen]]s, repeated physical injury, heat, ionising radiation or [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson DA, Tan TT, Rabson AB, Anderson D, Degenhardt K, White E |title=Hypoxia and defective apoptosis drive genomic instability and tumorigenesis |journal=Genes &amp; Development |volume=18 |issue=17 |pages=2095–107 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15314031 |pmc=515288 |doi=10.1101/gad.1204904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The errors that cause cancer are self-amplifying and compounding, for example:
* A mutation in the error-correcting machinery of a cell might cause that cell and its children to accumulate errors more rapidly.
* A further mutation in an oncogene might cause the cell to reproduce more rapidly and more frequently than its normal counterparts.
* A further mutation may cause loss of a tumor suppressor gene, disrupting the apoptosis signaling pathway and immortalizing the cell.
* A further mutation in the signaling machinery of the cell might send error-causing signals to nearby cells.

The transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a [[chain reaction]] caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth. This rebellion-like scenario is an undesirable [[survival of the fittest]], where the driving forces of [[evolution]] work against the body's design and enforcement of order. Once cancer has begun to develop, this ongoing process, termed ''[[Somatic evolution in cancer|clonal evolution]]'', drives progression towards more invasive [[cancer staging|stages]].&lt;ref name="pmid17109012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merlo LM, Pepper JW, Reid BJ, Maley CC |s2cid=8040576 |title=Cancer as an evolutionary and ecological process |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=924–35 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17109012 |doi=10.1038/nrc2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clonal evolution leads to intra-[[tumour heterogeneity]] (cancer cells with heterogeneous mutations) that complicates designing effective treatment strategies.

Characteristic abilities developed by cancers are divided into categories, specifically evasion of apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, metastasis, reprogramming of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction.&lt;ref name=Han2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Han2011/&gt;

===Epigenetics===
{{Main|Cancer epigenetics}}
[[File:Diagram Damage to Cancer Wiki 300dpi.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The central role of DNA damage and epigenetic defects in DNA repair genes in carcinogenesis]]

The classical view of cancer is a set of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes and chromosomal abnormalities. Later [[Epigenetics|epigenetic alterations]]' role was identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baylin SB, Ohm JE |s2cid=2514545 |title=Epigenetic gene silencing in cancer – a mechanism for early oncogenic pathway addiction? |journal=Nature Reviews.

[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic]] alterations are functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not change the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in [[DNA methylation]] (hypermethylation and hypomethylation), [[histone modification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanwal R, Gupta S |title=Epigenetic modifications in cancer |journal=Clinical Genetics |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=303–11 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22082348 |pmc=3590802 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2011.01809.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as [[HMGA2]] or [[HMGA1]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldassarre G, Battista S, Belletti B, Thakur S, Pentimalli F, Trapasso F, Fedele M, Pierantoni G, Croce CM, Fusco A |title=Negative regulation of BRCA1 gene expression by HMGA1 proteins accounts for the reduced BRCA1 protein levels in sporadic breast carcinoma |journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=2225–38 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12640109 |pmc=150734 |doi=10.1128/MCB.23.7.2225-2238.2003}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these alterations regulates gene expression without altering the underlying [[DNA sequence]]. These changes may remain through [[cell division]]s, last for multiple generations and can be considered to be epimutations (equivalent to mutations).

Epigenetic alterations occur frequently in cancers. As an example, one study listed protein coding genes that were frequently altered in their methylation in association with colon cancer. These included 147 hypermethylated and 27 hypomethylated genes. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.&lt;ref name="Sch"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schnekenburger M, Diederich M |title=Epigenetics Offer New Horizons for Colorectal Cancer Prevention |journal=Current Colorectal Cancer Reports |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22389639 |pmc=3277709 |doi=10.1007/s11888-011-0116-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, may be of particular importance. Such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of the [[Genome instability|genetic]] instability characteristic of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacinto FV, Esteller M |title=Mutator pathways unleashed by epigenetic silencing in human cancer |journal=Mutagenesis |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=247–53 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17412712 |doi=10.1093/mutage/gem009|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lahtz C, Pfeifer GP |title=Epigenetic changes of DNA repair genes in cancer |journal=Journal of Molecular Cell Biology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=51–8 |date=February 2011 |pmid=21278452 |pmc=3030973 |doi=10.1093/jmcb/mjq053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein C, Nfonsam V, Prasad AR, Bernstein H |title=Epigenetic field defects in progression to cancer |journal=World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=43–49 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23671730 |pmc=3648662 |doi=10.4251/wjgo.v5.i3.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduced expression of DNA repair genes disrupts DNA repair. This is shown in the figure at the 4th level from the top. (In the figure, red wording indicates the central role of DNA damage and defects in DNA repair in progression to cancer.) When DNA repair is deficient DNA damage remains in cells at a higher than usual level (5th level) and cause increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation (6th level).

Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can increase cancer risks. Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]) have increased cancer risk, with some defects ensuring a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malkin D |title=Li-fraumeni syndrome |journal=Genes &amp; Cancer |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=475–84 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21779515 |pmc=3135649 |doi=10.1177/1947601911413466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germ line DNA repair mutations are noted on the figure's left side. However, such [[germline]] mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fearon ER |title=Human cancer syndromes: clues to the origin and nature of cancer |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5340 |pages=1043–50 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9353177 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5340.1043|bibcode=1997Sci...278.1043F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. This is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level. Many studies of heavy metal-induced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of DNA repair enzymes, some through epigenetic mechanisms. DNA repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metal-induced carcinogenicity. In addition, frequent epigenetic alterations of the DNA sequences code for small RNAs called [[microRNA]]s (or miRNAs). miRNAs do not code for proteins, but can "target" protein-coding genes and reduce their expression.

Cancers usually arise from an assemblage of mutations and epimutations that confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion (see [[Neoplasm#Field defects in progression to cancer|Field defects in progression to cancer]]). Mutations, however, may not be as frequent in cancers as epigenetic alterations. An average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein-altering mutations, of which about three or four may be "driver" mutations and the remaining ones may be "passenger" mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA, Kinzler KW |title=Cancer genome landscapes |journal=Science |volume=339 |issue=6127 |pages=1546–58 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23539594 |pmc=3749880 |doi=10.1126/science.1235122|bibcode=2013Sci...339.1546V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metastasis===
{{main|Metastasis}}
[[Metastasis]] is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.&lt;ref name="metastasis"/&gt; Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.&lt;ref name="What is Metastasized Cancer"/&gt;

Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the [[lymphatic system]] or both. The typical steps in metastasis are local [[Invasion (cancer)|invasion]], [[intravasation]] into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, [[extravasation]] into the new tissue, proliferation and [[angiogenesis]]. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the [[lung]]s, [[liver]], brain and the [[bone]]s.&lt;ref name="metastasis"/&gt;

===Metabolism===
{{main|Tumor metabolome}}

Normal cells typically generate only about 30% of energy from [[glycolysis]],&lt;ref name="pmid23226794"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Zheng J | title=Energy metabolism of cancer: Glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (Review) | journal=[[Oncology Letters]] | volume=4 | issue=6 | pages=1151–1157 | year=2012  | doi = 10.3892/ol.2012.928 | pmc= 3506713 | pmid=23226794}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas most cancers rely on glycolysis for energy production ([[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]]).&lt;ref name="pmid20181022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seyfried TN, Shelton LM | title=Cancer as a metabolic disease | journal=[[Nutrition &amp; Metabolism]] | volume=7 | pages=7 | year=2010  | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-7-7 | pmc= 2845135 | pmid=20181022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid31781842"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weiss JM | title=The promise and peril of targeting cell metabolism for cancer therapy | journal=[[Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy]] | volume=69 | issue=2 | pages=255–261 | year=2020  | doi = 10.1007/s00262-019-02432-7 | pmc= 7004869 | pmid=31781842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid32523242"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Al-Azzam N | title=Sirtuin 6 and metabolic genes interplay in Warburg effect in cancers| journal=[[Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition]] | volume=66 | issue=3 | pages=169–175 | year=2020 | url=https://www.jbc.org/content/295/32/11021.long | doi = 10.3164/jcbn.19-110 | pmc= 7263929 | pmid=32523242}}&lt;/ref&gt; But a minority of cancer types rely on [[oxidative phosphorylation]] as the primary energy source, including [[lymphoma]], [[leukemia]], and [[endometrial cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid33028168"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farhadi P, Yarani R, Dokaneheifard S, Mansouri K  | title = The emerging role of targeting cancer metabolism for cancer therapy | journal = [[Tumor Biology]] | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 1010428320965284 | year = 2020 | doi = 10.1177/1010428320965284 | pmid = 33028168 | s2cid = 222214285 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in these cases, however, the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds 60%.&lt;ref name="pmid23226794" /&gt; A few cancers use [[glutamine]] as the major energy source, partly because it provides nitrogen required for [[nucleotide]] (DNA,RNA) synthesis.&lt;ref name="pmid26771115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Pavlova NN, Thompson CB | title=The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism | journal=[[Cell Metabolism]] | volume=23 | issue=1 | pages=27–47 | year=2016  | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.006 | pmc= 4715268 | pmid=26771115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23226794" /&gt; [[Cancer stem cell]]s often use oxidative phosphorylation or glutamine as a primary energy source.&lt;ref name="pmid32670883"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Yadav UP, Singh T, Kumar P, Mehta K | title=Metabolic Adaptations in Cancer Stem Cells | journal=[[Frontiers in Oncology]] | volume=10 | pages=1010 | year=2020  | doi = 10.3389/fonc.2020.01010 | pmc= 7330710 | pmid=32670883| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have indicated that the enzyme [[sirtuin 6]] is selectively inactivated during [[oncogenesis]] in a variety of tumor types by inducing glycolysis.&lt;ref name="pmid32523242" /&gt; Another [[sirtuin]], [[sirtuin 3]] inhibits cancers that depend upon [[glycolysis]], but promotes cancers that depend upon [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name="pmid32724473"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Zhang J, Xiang H, Rong-Rong He R, Liu B | title=Mitochondrial Sirtuin 3: New emerging biological function and therapeutic target | journal=[[Theranostics (journal)|Theranostics]] | volume=10 | issue=18 | pages=8315–8342| year=2020 | doi = 10.7150/thno.45922 | pmc=7381741 | pmid=32724473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[low-carbohydrate diet]] ([[ketogenic diet]]) has been sometimes been recommended as a supportive therapy for cancer treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid32219096"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Seyfried TN, Mukherjee P, Chinopoulos C | title=Consideration of Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy as a Complementary or Alternative Approach for Managing Breast Cancer | journal=[[Frontiers in Nutrition]] | volume=7  |pages=21 | year=2020  | doi = 10.3389/fnut.2020.00021 | pmc= 7078107 | pmid=32219096| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid31399389"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Weber DD, Aminzadeh-Gohari S, Tulipan J, Kofler B | title=Ketogenic diet in the treatment of cancer - Where do we stand?s | journal=[[Molecular Metabolism]] | volume=33 | pages=102–121 | year=2020  | doi = 10.1016/j.molmet.2019.06.026 | pmc= 7056920 | pmid=31399389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Thorax pa peripheres Bronchialcarcinom li OF markiert.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Chest [[Projectional radiography|X-ray]] showing lung cancer in the left lung]]

Most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through [[cancer screening|screening]]. Neither of these leads to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a [[anatomical pathology|pathologist]]. People with suspected cancer are investigated with [[medical test]]s. These commonly include [[blood test]]s, [[Projectional radiography|X-rays]], ([[contrast CT|contrast]]) [[CT scan]]s and [[endoscopy]].

The tissue [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] from the biopsy indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its [[histological grade]], genetic abnormalities and other features. Together, this information is useful to evaluate the [[prognosis]] and to choose the best treatment.

[[Cytogenetics]] and [[immunohistochemistry]] are other types of tissue tests. These tests provide information about molecular changes (such as [[mutation]]s, [[fusion gene]]s and numerical [[chromosome]] changes) and may thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment.

Cancer diagnosis can cause psychological distress and psychosocial interventions, such as talking therapy, may help people with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galway K, Black A, Cantwell M, Cardwell CR, Mills M, Donnelly M | title = Psychosocial interventions to improve quality of life and emotional wellbeing for recently diagnosed cancer patients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD007064 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23152241 | pmc = 6457819 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd007064.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{further|List of cancer types|List of oncology-related terms}}
Cancers are classified by the [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|type of cell]] that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor. These types include:
* [[Carcinoma]]: Cancers derived from [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers and include nearly all those in the [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]], [[lung cancer|lung]], [[pancreas]] and [[Colorectal cancer|colon]].
* [[Sarcoma]]: Cancers arising from [[connective tissue]] (i.e. [[bone]], [[cartilage]], fat, [[nerve]]), each of which develops from cells originating in [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]] cells outside the bone marrow.
* [[Lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]]: These two classes arise from hematopoietic (blood-forming) cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Varricchio | first = Claudette G. | name-list-style = vanc | title = A cancer source book for nurses |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2004 |page=229 |isbn=978-0-7637-3276-9 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jkqdgZcF9qcC |page=229}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Germ cell tumor]]: Cancers derived from [[pluripotent]] cells, most often presenting in the [[testicular cancer|testicle]] or the [[ovarian cancer|ovary]] ([[seminoma]] and [[dysgerminoma]], respectively).
* [[Blastoma]]: Cancers derived from immature "precursor" cells or embryonic tissue.

Cancers are usually named using ''-carcinoma'', ''-sarcoma'' or ''-blastoma'' as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or tissue of origin as the root. For example, cancers of the liver [[parenchyma]] arising from malignant epithelial cells is called ''[[hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocarcinoma]]'', while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a [[hepatoblastoma]] and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a ''[[liposarcoma]]''. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called ''[[mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal carcinoma of the breast]]''. Here, the adjective ''ductal'' refers to the appearance of cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts.

[[Benign tumor]]s (which are not cancers) are named using ''-oma'' as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a ''[[leiomyoma]]'' (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is ''[[uterine fibroid|fibroid]]''). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the ''-noma'' suffix, examples including [[melanoma]] and [[seminoma]].

Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, [[spindle cell carcinoma]] and [[small-cell carcinoma]].

==Screening==
{{Main|Cancer screening}}
Unlike diagnostic efforts prompted by [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign]]s, cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/screening/patient-screening-overview-pdq |title=Cancer Screening Overview (PDQ®)–Patient Version |publisher=National Cancer Institute |access-date=28 March 2018 |date=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve [[physical examination]], [[blood test|blood]] or [[urinalysis|urine tests]] or [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=NIH/&gt;

[[Cancer biomarker|Cancer screening]] is not available for many types of cancers. Even when tests are available, they may not be recommended for everyone. ''[[Universal screening]]'' or ''mass screening'' involves screening everyone.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson JMG, Jungner G. (1968) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604205519/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/php/WHO_PHP_34.pdf Principles and practice of screening for disease.] Geneva:[[World Health Organization]]. Public Health Papers, #34.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Selective screening'' identifies people who are at higher risk, such as people with a family history.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening.&lt;ref name=NIH/&gt; These factors include:
* Possible harms from the screening test: for example, X-ray images involve exposure to potentially harmful [[ionizing radiation]]
* The likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer
* The likelihood that cancer is present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers.
* Possible harms from follow-up procedures
* Whether suitable treatment is available
* Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes
* Whether the cancer will ever need treatment
* Whether the test is acceptable to the people: If a screening test is too burdensome (for example, extremely painful), then people will refuse to participate.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Management of cancer|oncology}}

Many treatment options for cancer exist. The primary ones include surgery, [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]], [[targeted therapy]] and [[palliative care]]. Which treatments are used depends on the type, location and grade of the cancer as well as the patient's health and preferences. The [[therapy#By treatment intent|treatment intent]] may or may not be curative.

===Chemotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] is the treatment of cancer with one or more [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] anti-[[neoplastic]] drugs ([[list of chemotherapeutic agents|chemotherapeutic agents]]) as part of a [[chemotherapy regimen|standardized regimen]]. The term encompasses a variety of drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as [[Alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agents]] and [[antimetabolite]]s.&lt;ref name="Lind2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lind MJ |title=Principles of cytotoxic chemotherapy |journal=Medicine |year=2008 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–23 |doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, a critical property of most cancer cells.

It was found that providing combined cytotoxic drugs is better than a single drug; a process called the [[combination therapy]]; which has an advantage in the statistics of survival and response to the tumor and in the progress of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Emil Frei |first1=I. I. I. |last2=Eder |first2=Joseph Paul |title=Combination Chemotherapy |date=2003 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13955/ |access-date=4 April 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review concluded that combined therapy was more effective to treat metastasized breast cancer. However, generally it is not certain whether combination chemotherapy leads to better health outcomes, when both survival and toxicity are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dear RF, McGeechan K, Jenkins MC, Barratt A, Tattersall MH, Wilcken N | title = Combination versus sequential single agent chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD008792 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24347031 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008792.pub2 | pmc = 8094913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Targeted therapy]] is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between cancer and normal cells. The first targeted therapies blocked the [[estrogen receptor]] molecule, inhibiting the growth of breast cancer. Another common example is the class of [[Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor|Bcr-Abl inhibitors]], which are used to treat [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML).&lt;ref name=TCT2018/&gt; Currently, targeted therapies exist for many of the most common cancer types, including [[bladder cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]], [[kidney cancer]], [[leukemia]], [[liver cancer]], [[lung cancer]], [[lymphoma]], [[pancreatic cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[skin cancer]], and [[thyroid cancer]] as well as other cancer types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeted Cancer Therapies|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies/targeted-therapies-fact-sheet|website=About Cancer|publisher=National Cancer Institute|access-date=28 March 2018|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. In combination with surgery, chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[osteosarcoma|osteogenic sarcoma]], [[testicular cancer]], ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers.&lt;ref name=HollandTx40/&gt; Chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, such as some [[leukemias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nastoupil LJ, Rose AC, Flowers CR |title=Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: current treatment approaches |journal=Oncology |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=488–95 |date=May 2012 |pmid=22730604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freedman A |title=Follicular lymphoma: 2012 update on diagnosis and management |journal=American Journal of Hematology |volume=87 |issue=10 |pages=988–95 |date=October 2012 |pmid=23001911 |doi=10.1002/ajh.23313|s2cid=35447562 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; ineffective in some [[brain tumors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rampling R, James A, Papanastassiou V |title=The present and future management of malignant brain tumours: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=75 Suppl 2 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=ii24–30 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15146036 |pmc=1765659 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2004.040535}}&lt;/ref&gt; and needless in others, such as most [[non-melanoma skin cancer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madan V, Lear JT, Szeimies RM |title=Non-melanoma skin cancer |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9715 |pages=673–85 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20171403 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61196-X|pmc=3339125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by its toxicity to other tissues in the body. Even when chemotherapy does not provide a permanent cure, it may be useful to reduce symptoms such as pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will become possible in the future.

===Radiation===
[[Radiation therapy]] involves the use of [[ionizing radiation]] in an attempt to either cure or improve symptoms.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; --&gt; It works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue, killing it. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs, which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from multiple exposure angles to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. As with chemotherapy, cancers vary in their response to radiation therapy.&lt;ref&gt;CK Bomford, IH Kunkler, J Walter. Walter and Miller's Textbook of Radiation therapy (6th Ed), p311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=2060451853 |title=tumour radiosensitivity – General Practice Notebook |first=Jim McMorran, Damian Crowther, Stew McMorran, Steve Youngmin, Ian Wacogne, Jon Pleat, Clive |last=Prince |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023421/http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=2060451853 |archive-date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://patient.info/doctor/radiotherapy-pro |title=Radiotherapy |publisher=[[Patient UK]] | first = Colin | last = Tidy | name-list-style = vanc | url-status = live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709084620/https://patient.info/doctor/radiotherapy-pro |archive-date=9 July 2017}} Last Checked: 23 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiation therapy is used in about half of cases. The radiation can be either from internal sources ([[brachytherapy]]) or external sources.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; --&gt; The radiation is most commonly low energy X-rays for treating skin cancers, while higher energy X-rays are used for cancers within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill R, Healy B, Holloway L, Kuncic Z, Thwaites D, Baldock C |s2cid=18082594 |title=Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry |journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=R183–231 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24584183 |doi=10.1088/0031-9155/59/6/r183|bibcode=2014PMB....59R.183H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy. For certain types of cancer, such as early [[head and neck cancer]], it may be used alone.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; For painful [[bone metastasis]], it has been found to be effective in about 70% of patients.&lt;ref name=H41&gt;Holland Chp. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
Surgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated, solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=HollandTx40/&gt; --&gt; It is typically an important part of definitive diagnosis and staging of tumors, as biopsies are usually required.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=HollandTx40/&gt; --&gt; In localized cancer, surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with, in certain cases, the [[lymph node]]s in the area.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=HollandTx40/&gt; --&gt; For some types of cancer this is sufficient to eliminate the cancer.&lt;ref name=HollandTx40&gt;Holland Chp. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palliative care===
[[Palliative care]] is treatment that attempts to help the patient feel better and may be combined with an attempt to treat the cancer. Palliative care includes action to reduce physical, emotional, spiritual and psycho-social distress. Unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve [[quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]].

People at all stages of cancer treatment typically receive some kind of palliative care. In some cases, [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] [[professional organizations]] recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care.&lt;ref name="ASCOfive"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link=American Society of Clinical Oncology |title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |journal=Choosing Wisely: An Initiative of the ABIM Foundation |url=http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |access-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073425/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |archive-date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to patients who:&lt;ref&gt;* The American Society of Clinical Oncology made this recommendation based on various cancers.

Palliative care may be confused with [[hospice]] and therefore only indicated when people approach [[End-of-life care|end of life]]. Like hospice care, palliative care attempts to help the patient cope with their immediate needs and to increase comfort. Unlike hospice care, palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at the cancer.

Multiple national [[medical guideline]]s recommend early palliative care for patients whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms or who need help coping with their illness. In patients first diagnosed with metastatic disease, palliative care may be immediately indicated. Palliative care is indicated for patients with a prognosis of less than 12 months of life even given aggressive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/default.asp |title=NCCN Guidelines |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514153600/http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/default.asp |archive-date=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/guideline.pdf |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care |publisher=The National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care (NCP) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516082645/http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/Guideline.pdf |archive-date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levy MH, Back A, Bazargan S, Benedetti C, Billings JA, Block S, Bruera E, Carducci MA, Dy S, Eberle C, Foley KM, Harris JD, Knight SJ, Milch R, Rhiner M, Slatkin NE, Spiegel D, Sutton L, Urba S, Von Roenn JH, Weinstein SM |s2cid=44343423 |title=Palliative care.

===Immunotherapy===
{{main|Cancer immunotherapy}}
A variety of therapies using [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]], stimulating or helping the [[immune system]] to fight cancer, have come into use since 1997. Approaches include [[Monoclonal antibody|antibodies]], checkpoint therapy, and [[adoptive cell transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waldmann TA |s2cid=9745527 |title=Immunotherapy: past, present and future |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=269–77 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12612576 |doi=10.1038/nm0303-269 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser therapy ===
{{Main|Lasers in cancer treatment}}
[[Laser]] therapy uses high-intensity light to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths. Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs. It is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer. It is often combined with other treatments, such as [[surgery]], chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. [[Laser ablation|Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy]] (LITT), or interstitial laser [[Laser coagulation|photocoagulation]], uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells. Laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is surgeons must have specialized training. It may be more expensive than other treatments.&lt;ref name="NIHlaser"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/surgery/lasers-fact-sheet|title=Lasers in Cancer Treatment|date=13 September 2011|publisher=National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute|access-date=15 December 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative medicine ===
[[Alternative cancer treatments|Complementary and alternative cancer treatments]] are a diverse group of therapies, practices and products that are not part of conventional medicine.&lt;ref name="mnalt"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassileth BR, Deng G |title=Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer |journal=The Oncologist |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=80–89 |year=2004 |pmid=14755017 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80|url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/9/1/80.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Complementary medicine" refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while "alternative medicine" refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/#2 What Is CAM?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208040402/http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/ |date=8 December 2005 }} [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. Retrieved 3 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using conventional techniques such as clinical trials. Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted. Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers stated, "The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'."&lt;ref name="pmid15061600"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vickers A |title=Alternative cancer cures: "unproven" or "disproven"? |journal=Ca |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=110–18 |year=2004 |pmid=15061600 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.2180 |s2cid=35124492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
{{See also|Cancer survival rates|List of cancer mortality rates in the United States|Cancer survivor}}
[[File:Three measures of cancer mortality, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Three measures of global cancer mortality from 1990 to 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Three measures of cancer mortality |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-deaths-rate-and-age-standardized-rate-index |website=Our World in Data |access-date=7 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Survival rates vary by cancer type and by the stage at which it is diagnosed, ranging from majority survival to complete mortality five years after diagnosis. Once a cancer has metastasized, prognosis normally becomes much worse. About half of patients receiving treatment for invasive cancer (excluding [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']] and non-melanoma skin cancers) die from that cancer or its treatment.&lt;ref name=Epi11/&gt; A majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases of the primary tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-030419-033413|title=Investigating Tumor Heterogeneity in Mouse Models|year=2020|last1=Tammela|first1=Tuomas|last2=Sage|first2=Julien|journal=Annual Review of Cancer Biology|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99–119|pmid=34164589|pmc=8218894|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survival is worse in the [[developing world]],&lt;ref name="Epi11" /&gt; partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are harder to treat than those associated with [[developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Cancer Report 2014 |date=2014 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=978-92-832-0429-9 |url=http://www.searo.who.int/publications/bookstore/documents/9283204298/en/ |page=22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712114430/http://www.searo.who.int/publications/bookstore/documents/9283204298/en/ |archive-date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed.&lt;ref name="isbn1-55009-213-8" /&gt; The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer (particularly radiation therapy), and to better compliance with screening.&lt;ref name="isbn1-55009-213-8"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Frei | editor-first1 = Emil | editor-last2 = Kufe | editor-first2 = Donald W. | editor-last3 = Holland | editor-first3 = James F. | last1 = Rheingold | first1 = Susan | last2 = Neugut | first2 = Alfred | last3 = Meadows | first3 = Anna | name-list-style = vanc | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition = 6th | publisher = BC Decker | location = Hamilton, Ont | year = 2003 | page = [https://archive.org/details/cancermedicine60002unse/page/2399 2399] | isbn = 978-1-55009-213-4 | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20948/#A41087 | chapter = 156: Secondary Cancers: Incidence, Risk Factors, and Management | url = https://archive.org/details/cancermedicine60002unse/page/2399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predicting short- or long-term survival depends on many factors. The most important are the cancer type and the patient's age and overall health. Those who are [[wikt:frailty|frail]] with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people. [[Centenarian]]s are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful. People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montazeri A |title=Quality of life data as prognostic indicators of survival in cancer patients: an overview of the literature from 1982 to 2008 |journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes |volume=7 |page=102 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20030832 |pmc=2805623 |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-7-102 |author-link=Ali Montazeri}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with lower quality of life may be affected by [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and other complications and/or disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal.

People with cancer have an increased risk of [[venous thromboembolism|blood clots in their veins]] which can be life-threatening.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akl EA, Kahale LA, Hakoum MB, Matar CF, Sperati F, Barba M, Yosuico VE, Terrenato I, Synnot A, Schünemann H | display-authors = 6 | title = Parenteral anticoagulation in ambulatory patients with cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | pages = CD006652 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28892556 | pmc = 6419241 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006652.pub5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Anticoagulant|blood thinners]] such as [[heparin]] decrease the risk of blood clots but have not been shown to increase survival in people with cancer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People who take blood thinners also have an increased risk of bleeding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although extremely rare, some forms of cancer, even from an advanced stage, can heal spontaneously. This phenomenon is known as the [[spontaneous remission]].&lt;ref&gt;Radha G., Lopus M. (2021) The spontaneous remission of cancer: Current insights and therapeutic significance.

The physician John Hill described tobacco snuff as the cause of nose cancer in 1761.&lt;ref name=Hist2/&gt; This was followed by the report in 1775 by British surgeon [[Percivall Pott]] that [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]], a cancer of the [[scrotum]], was a common disease among [[chimney sweep]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hajdu SI |title=A note from history: landmarks in history of cancer, part 3 |journal=Cancer |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=1155–68 |date=February 2012 |pmid=21751192 |doi=10.1002/cncr.26320|s2cid=38892895 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ("[[metastasis]]").

==Society and culture==
Although many diseases (such as heart failure) may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos. The [[euphemism]] of "a long illness" to describe cancers leading to death is still commonly used in obituaries, rather than naming the disease explicitly, reflecting an apparent [[social stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Barbara |last=Ehrenreich |author-link=Barbara Ehrenreich |title=Welcome to Cancerland |newspaper=[[Harper's Magazine]] |date=November 2001 |issn=0017-789X |url=http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108181820/http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |archive-date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer is also euphemised as "the C-word";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pozorski |first1=Aimee |s2cid=160969212 |title=Confronting the "C" Word: Cancer and Death in Philip Roth's Fiction |journal=Philip Roth Studies |date=20 March 2015 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=105–123 |doi=10.5703/philrothstud.11.1.105 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/577333/pdf |access-date=13 April 2020 |language=en |issn=1940-5278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wollaston |first1=Sam |title=The C-Word review – a wonderful testament to a woman who faced cancer with honesty, verve and wit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/04/the-c-word-review-sheridan-smith-cancer-wonderful-testament |access-date=13 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Avoiding the 'C' Word for Low-Risk Thyroid Cancer |url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/901265 |access-date=13 April 2020 |work=Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] uses the term to try to lessen the fear around the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The C word: how we react to cancer today |url=https://www.networks.nhs.uk/news/the-c-word-how-we-react-to-cancer-today |website=NHS Networks |access-date=13 April 2020 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nigeria, one local name for cancer translates into English as "the disease that cannot be cured".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tmrp7dkvJk4C&amp;pg=PA196|title=Handbook of Psychiatry in Palliative Medicine|last1=Chochinov|first1=Harvey Max|last2=Breitbart|first2=William | name-list-style = vanc |date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530107-6|page=196|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics: the most common form of cancer—non-melanoma [[skin cancer]]s, accounting for about one-third of cancer cases worldwide, but very few deaths&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rapini | first1 = Ronald P. | last2 = Bolognia | first2 = Jean L. | last3 = Jorizzo | first3 = Joseph L. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4160-2999-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Skin cancers |url=https://www.who.int/uv/faq/skincancer/en/index1.html |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=19 January 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927065836/http://www.who.int/uv/faq/skincancer/en/index1.html |archive-date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured, often in a single, short, outpatient procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCulley |first1=Michelle |last2=Greenwell |first2=Pamela | name-list-style = vanc |title=Molecular therapeutics: 21st-century medicine |publisher=J.

Western conceptions of [[patients' rights]] for people with cancer include a duty to fully disclose the medical situation to the person, and the right to engage in [[Shared decision-making in medicine|shared decision-making]] in a way that respects the person's own values. In other cultures, other rights and values are preferred. For example, most African cultures value whole families rather than [[individualism]]. In parts of Africa, a diagnosis is commonly made so late that cure is not possible, and treatment, if available at all, would quickly bankrupt the family. As a result of these factors, African healthcare providers tend to let family members decide whether, when and how to disclose the diagnosis, and they tend to do so slowly and circuitously, as the person shows interest and an ability to cope with the grim news.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People from Asian and South American countries also tend to prefer a slower, less candid approach to disclosure than is idealized in the United States and Western Europe, and they believe that sometimes it would be preferable not to be told about a cancer diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In general, disclosure of the diagnosis is more common than it was in the 20th century, but full disclosure of the prognosis is not offered to many patients around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States and some other cultures, cancer is regarded as a disease that must be "fought" to end the "civil insurrection"; a [[War on Cancer]] was declared in the US. Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer's human effects, and they emphasize both the state of the patient's health and the need to take immediate, decisive actions himself rather than to delay, to ignore or to rely entirely on others. The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments.&lt;ref name="Gwyn"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Graham |last1=Low |first2=Lynne |last2=Cameron | name-list-style = vanc |title=Researching and Applying Metaphor |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=8aOxMvo_ag8C}}|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64964-3| chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gayle A. |last=Sulik |title=Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_it2CwAAQBAJ |page=78}}|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974993-5|pages=78–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Both refs apply to the whole paragraph --&gt;

In the 1970s, a relatively popular [[alternative cancer treatment]] in the US was a specialized form of [[talk therapy]], based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt; People with a "cancer personality"—depressed, repressed, self-loathing and afraid to express their emotions—were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire. Some psychotherapists said that treatment to change the patient's outlook on life would cure the cancer.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt; Among other effects, this belief allowed society to [[Victim blaming|blame the victim]] for having caused the cancer (by "wanting" it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless and loving person).&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt; It also increased patients' anxiety, as they incorrectly believed that natural emotions of sadness, anger or fear shorten their lives.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt; The idea was ridiculed by [[Susan Sontag]], who published ''[[Illness as Metaphor]]'' while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in 1978.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book | first = James S. | last = Olson | name-list-style = vanc |title=Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer, and History |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=gp9aMBieClMC |page=145}}|year=2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8064-3| pages = 145–70 | oclc = 186453370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense, the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread, but incorrect, belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of [[Optimism|positive thinking]] will increase survival.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Ehrenreich |author-link=Barbara Ehrenreich |title=Bright-sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wxJlvB7bCO4C |page=15}}|year=2009|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-0-8050-8749-9| pages = 15–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion is particularly strong in [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

One idea about why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized, called the [[just-world hypothesis]], is that blaming cancer on the patient's actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain a sense of control. This is based upon the blamers' belief that the world is fundamentally just and so any dangerous illness, like cancer, must be a type of punishment for bad choices, because in a just world, bad things would not happen to good people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Sick Stigma: Why are cancer patients blamed for their illness? |date=24 September 2013 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/09/cancer_stigma_don_t_blame_patients_for_their_disease_no_matter_what_the.html |newspaper=Slate |last=Huff |first=Charlotte|name-list-style = vanc |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011120507/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/09/cancer_stigma_don_t_blame_patients_for_their_disease_no_matter_what_the.html |archive-date=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effect ===
The total health care expenditure on cancer in the US was estimated to be $80.2 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Impact of Cancer |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/economic-impact-of-cancer.html |website=American Cancer Society |date=3 January 2018 |access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though cancer-related health care expenditure have increased in absolute terms during recent decades, the share of health expenditure devoted to cancer treatment has remained close to 5% between the 1960s and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bosanquet N, Sikora K |title=The economics of cancer care in the UK |journal=Lancet Oncology |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=568–74 |year=2004 |pmid=15337487 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(04)01569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mariotto AB, Yabroff KR, Shao Y, Feuer EJ, Brown ML |title=Projections of the cost of cancer care in the United States: 2010-2020 |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=117–28 |year=2011 |pmid=21228314 |pmc=3107566 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djq495}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern has been observed in Europe where about 6% of all health care expenditure are spent on cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jönsson B, Hofmarcher T, Lindgren P, Wilking N |title=The cost and burden of cancer in the European Union 1995–2014 |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=66 |issue=Oct |pages=162–70 |year=2016 |pmid=27589247 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2016.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EJC2018&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hofmarcher T, Lindgren P, Wilking N, Jönsson B |title=The cost of cancer in Europe 2018 |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=129 |issue=Apr |pages=41–49 |year=2020 |pmid=32120274 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2020.01.011|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to health care expenditure and [[financial toxicity]], cancer causes indirect costs in the form of productivity losses due to sick days, permanent incapacity and disability as well as premature death during working age. Cancer causes also costs for informal care. Indirect costs and informal care costs are typically estimated to exceed or equal the health care costs of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luengo-Fernandez R, Leal J, Gray A, Sullivan R |title=Economic burden of cancer across the European Union: a population-based cost analysis |journal=Lancet Oncology |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=1165–74 |year=2013 |pmid=24131614 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70442-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EJC2018/&gt;

=== Workplace ===
In the United States, cancer is included as a protected condition by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC), mainly due to the potential for cancer having discriminating effects on workers.&lt;ref name="EEOC"&gt;U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. "Questions &amp; Answers about Cancer in the Workplace and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)." https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/cancer.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination in the workplace could occur if an employer holds a false belief that a person with cancer is not capable of doing a job properly, and may ask for more [[sick leave]] than other employees. Employers may also make hiring or firing decisions based on misconceptions about cancer disabilities, if present. The EEOC provides interview guidelines for employers, as well as lists of possible solutions for assessing and accommodating employees with cancer.&lt;ref name="EEOC" /&gt;

Cancer research focuses on the following issues:
* Agents (e.g. viruses) and events (e.g. mutations) that cause or facilitate genetic changes in cells destined to become cancer.
* The precise nature of the genetic damage and the genes that are affected by it.
* The consequences of those genetic changes on the biology of the cell, both in generating the defining properties of a cancer cell and in facilitating additional genetic events that lead to further progression of the cancer.

The improved understanding of [[molecular biology]] and [[cell biology|cellular biology]] due to cancer research has led to new treatments for cancer since US President [[Richard Nixon]] declared the "[[War on Cancer]]" in 1971. Since then, the country has spent over $200 billion on cancer research, including resources from public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sharon |last=Begley | name-list-style = vanc |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/157548/page/2 |title=Rethinking the War on Cancer |date=16 September 2008 |website=Newsweek |access-date=8 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910012446/http://www.newsweek.com/id/157548/page/2 |archive-date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) declined by five percent between 1950 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/health/policy/24cancer.html |title=Advances Elusive in the Drive to Cure Cancer |last=Kolata |first=Gina |author-link=Gina Kolata|name-list-style=vanc |date=23 April 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114120509/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/health/policy/24cancer.html |archive-date=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition for financial resources appears to have suppressed the creativity, cooperation, risk-taking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries, unduly favoring low-risk research into small incremental advancements over riskier, more innovative research. Other consequences of competition appear to be many studies with dramatic claims whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Bruce Alberts]], Marc W.

==Pregnancy==
Cancer affects approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnant women. The most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in non-pregnant women during childbearing ages: breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.&lt;ref name="yarbro" /&gt;

Diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy. As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average. Some imaging procedures, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRIs]] (magnetic resonance imaging), [[CT scan]]s, ultrasounds and [[mammography|mammograms]] with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], are not.&lt;ref name="yarbro" /&gt;

Treatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women. However, radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries are often used to advance the start of treatment. Surgery is generally safe, but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage. Some treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the [[first trimester]], increase the risk of [[birth defect]]s and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).&lt;ref name="yarbro" /&gt;

Elective abortions are not required and, for the most common forms and stages of cancer, do not improve the mother's survival. In a few instances, such as advanced uterine cancer, the pregnancy cannot be continued and in others, the patient may end the pregnancy so that she can begin aggressive chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="yarbro" /&gt;

Some treatments can interfere with the mother's ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed.&lt;ref name="yarbro" /&gt; Cervical cancer may require birth by [[Caesarean section]]. Radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of [[mastitis]]. Also, when chemotherapy is given after birth, many of the drugs appear in breast milk, which could harm the baby.&lt;ref name=yarbro&gt;{{cite book |first1=Connie Henke |last1=Yarbro |first2=Debra |last2=Wujcik |first3=Barbara Holmes |last3=Gobel | name-list-style = vanc |title=Cancer Nursing: Principles and Practice |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LJVTQs4QjJ0C |page=901}}|year=2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-6357-2|pages = 901–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2021}}[[Veterinary oncology]], concentrating mainly on cats and dogs, is a growing specialty in wealthy countries and the major forms of human treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy may be offered. The most common types of cancer differ, but the cancer burden seems at least as high in pets as in humans. Animals, typically rodents, are often used in cancer research and studies of natural cancers in larger animals may benefit research into human cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thamm |first1=Douglas |title=How companion animals contribute to the fight against cancer in humans |journal=Veterinaria Italiana |date=March 2009 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=111–20 |pmid=20391394 |url=http://www.izs.it/vet_italiana/2009/45_1/111.pdf |access-date=18 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723044907/http://www.izs.it/vet_italiana/2009/45_1/111.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-humans, a few types of [[transmissible cancer]] have been described, wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves. This phenomenon is seen in dogs with [[Sticker's sarcoma]] (also known as canine transmissible venereal tumor), and in [[Tasmanian devils]] with [[devil facial tumour disease]] (DFTD).&lt;ref name="pmid16901782"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murgia C, Pritchard JK, Kim SY, Fassati A, Weiss RA |title=Clonal origin and evolution of a transmissible cancer |journal=Cell |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=477–87 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16901782 |pmc=2593932 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;
