'''Sabah''' ({{IPA-may|saˈbah}}) is a [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] of [[Malaysia]] located on the northern portion of [[Borneo]], in the region of [[East Malaysia]]. Sabah has land borders with the Malaysian state of [[Sarawak]] to the southwest and [[Indonesia]]'s [[Kalimantan]] region to the south. The [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] of [[Labuan]] is an island just off the Sabah coast. Sabah shares maritime borders with [[Vietnam]] to the west and the [[Philippines]] to the north and east. [[Kota Kinabalu]] is the state capital city, the economic centre of the state, and the seat of the [[Government of Sabah|Sabah state government]]. Other major towns in Sabah include [[Sandakan]] and [[Tawau]]. The 2015 census recorded a population of 3,543,500 in the state,&lt;ref name="2015 population"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pmr.penerangan.gov.my/index.php/info-terkini/19463-unjuran-populasi-penduduk-2015.html |title=Population by States and Ethnic Group |publisher=Department of Information, Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, Malaysia |year=2015 |access-date=12 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212125740/http://pmr.penerangan.gov.my/index.php/info-terkini/19463-unjuran-populasi-penduduk-2015.html |archive-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2019 it was estimated to have grown to over 3.9 million. Sabah has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s and abundant animal and plant species. The state has long [[mountain range]]s on the west side which forms part of the [[Crocker Range National Park]]. [[Kinabatangan River]], the second longest river in Malaysia runs through Sabah, and [[Mount Kinabalu]] is the highest point of Sabah as well as of Malaysia.

The earliest human settlement in Sabah can be traced back to 20,000–30,000 years ago along the Darvel Bay area at the Madai-Baturong caves. The state has had a trading relationship with China starting from the 14th century AD. Sabah came under the influence of the [[Bruneian Empire]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, while the eastern part of the territory was given to the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] because the Sultanate had helped the Bruneian empire in a battle and as such it was given to them as a gift between the 17th and 18th centuries. The state was subsequently acquired by the British-based [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] in the 19th century. During [[World War II]], Sabah was [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied by the Japanese]] for three years. It became a [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British Crown Colony]] in 1946. On 31 August 1963, Sabah was granted self-government by the British. Following this, Sabah became one of the founding members of the Federation of Malaysia (established on 16 September 1963) alongside [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] (expelled in 1965), and the [[Federation of Malaya]] ([[Peninsular Malaysia]] or West Malaysia). The federation was opposed by neighbouring Indonesia, which led to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] over three years along with the threats of annexation by the Philippines along with the Sultanate of Sulu, threats which continue to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{*}} {{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2512&amp;dat=19680924&amp;id=iRNIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2922,2921522&amp;hl=en |title=Filipino Students Protest in Manila Over Sabah Issue |newspaper=[[The Morning Journal]] |date=24 September 1968 |access-date=23 September 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{*}} {{cite book |author=Hans H.

In 1872, the Sultanate of Sulu granted use of an area of land in the Sandakan Bay to William Frederick Schuck, a former agent of the German consular service who had lived on the Sulu island of [[Jolo]] since 1864.

Sabah is also represented in the [[Parliament of Malaysia|federal parliament]] by 25 members elected from the same number of constituencies.

Prior to the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the then [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo interim government]] submitted a [[20-point agreement]] to the [[Federation of Malaya|Malayan government]] as conditions before North Borneo would join the federation. Subsequently, North Borneo legislative assembly agreed on the formation of Malaysia on the conditions that North Borneo's rights would be safeguarded. North Borneo then entered Malaysia as an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] state with autonomous laws in immigration control and [[Aboriginal title|Native Customary Rights]] (NCR), and the territory name was changed to "Sabah". However, under the administration of the [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO) led by Mustapha Harun, this autonomy has been gradually eroded with federal government influence and hegemony with a popular belief amongst Sabahans that both USNO and UMNO have been working together in permitting [[Illegal immigrants in Malaysia|illegal immigrants]] from the southern Philippines and Indonesia to stay in the state and become citizens to vote for Muslim parties.&lt;ref name="Sadiq2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamal Sadiq |title=Paper Citizens: How Illegal Immigrants Acquire Citizenship in Developing Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDa6LrF1yCIC&amp;pg=PA49 |date=2 December 2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-970780-5 |pages=49–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was continued under the [[Sabah People's United Front]] (BERJAYA) administration led by Harris Salleh with a total of 73,000 [[Refugees of the Philippines|Filipino refugees]] from the southern Philippines were registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsabahtimes.com.my/nstweb/print/65247 |title=Berjaya govt let 73,000 refugees into Sabah |author=Paul Mu |publisher=New Sabah Times |date=7 December 2014 |access-date=16 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216085317/http://www.newsabahtimes.com.my/nstweb/print/65247 |archive-date=16 December 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the cession of Labuan island to federal government by the Sabah state government under BERJAYA rule and unequal sharing and exploitation of Sabah's resources of petroleum have become grievances often raised by Sabahans, which has resulted in strong anti-federal sentiments and even occasional call for [[secession]] from the federation amongst the people of Sabah.&lt;ref name="Lim2008"/&gt;

Until the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 Malaysian general election]], Sabah along with the states of [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]], were the only three states in Malaysia that had ever been ruled by [[Opposition (Malaysia)|opposition parties]] not part of the ruling BN coalition. Under [[Joseph Pairin Kitingan]], PBS formed the state government after winning the [[Sabah state election, 1985|1985 state election]] and ruled Sabah until 1994. In the [[Sabah state election, 1994|1994 state election]], despite PBS winning the elections, subsequent cross-overs of PBS assembly members to the BN component party resulted in BN having the majority of seats and hence took over the helm of the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boon Kheng Cheah |title=Malaysia: the making of a nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Owo39zRMQbwC&amp;pg=PA63 |access-date=26 May 2013 |year=2002 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |isbn=978-981-230-175-8 |pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A unique feature of Sabah politics was a policy initiated by Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] in 1994 whereby the chief minister's post is rotated among the coalition parties every two years regardless of the party in power at the time, thus theoretically giving an equal amount of time for each major ethnic group to rule the state.

Sabah consists of five administrative divisions, which are in turn divided into 27 districts.

The administrative divisions are inherited from the British administration, which are before administered as province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

Sabah has seen several territorial disputes with Malaysia's neighbours Indonesia and the Philippines. In 2002, both Malaysia and Indonesia submitted to arbitration by the ICJ on a territorial dispute over the Ligitan and Sipadan islands which were later won by Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Justice2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="court result"/&gt; There are also several other disputes yet to be settled with Indonesia over the overlapping claims on the [[Ambalat]] continental shelf in the Celebes Sea and land border dispute between Sabah and [[North Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=103802 |title=Border disputes differ for Indonesia, M'sia |newspaper=Daily Express |date=16 October 2015 |access-date=9 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216030658/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=103802 |archive-date=16 February 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia's claim over a portion of the [[Spratly Islands]] is also based on sharing a continental shelf with Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chandran Jeshurun |title=China, India, Japan, and the Security of Southeast Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5e1xpmGbT0C&amp;pg=PA196 |year=1993 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |isbn=978-981-3016-61-3 |pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had said before the arrest that, although his country had provided support to the rebel group in the past in its bid for autonomy, Mr Misuari had not used his powers correctly.
