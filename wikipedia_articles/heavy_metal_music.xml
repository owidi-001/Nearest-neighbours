'''Heavy metal''' (or simply '''metal''')&lt;!--Metal is colloquial way of saying heavy metal, please don't change heavy metal to metal.--&gt; is a genre of [[rock music]]&lt;ref&gt;Du Noyer (2003), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Havers, [https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/metal-music-heavy-thunder/ "Heavy Metal Thunder: The Origins of Heavy Metal"], udiscovermusic.com, March 27, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; With roots in [[blues rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], and [[acid rock]],&lt;ref name=fast/&gt; heavy metal bands developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by [[distortion (music)|distortion]], extended [[guitar solo]]s, emphatic beats, and loudness. The lyrics and performances are sometimes associated with [[aggression]] and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=fast&gt;Fast (2005), pp. 89–91; Weinstein (2000), pp. 7, 8, 23, 36, 103, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers, [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]], were founded.&lt;ref name="Larson2004a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Larson|title=History of Rock and Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGJ7XmA8rjIC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2004|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub.|isbn=978-0-7872-9969-9|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and [[shock rock]] of [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]; the blues-rooted rock of [[Aerosmith]]; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party rock of [[Van Halen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMusic | id= heavy-metal-ma0000002721 | title= Heavy Metal Music Genre Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1970s, [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence,&lt;ref name="Walser 1993, p. 6"&gt;Walser (1993), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"As much as Sabbath started it, Priest were the ones who took it out of the blues and straight into metal." Bowe, Brian J. ''Judas Priest: Metal Gods''. {{ISBN|0-7660-3621-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Motörhead]] introduced a [[punk rock]] sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]" or "[[headbanging|headbangers]]".

During the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became popular with groups such as [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Mötley Crüe]]. [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], while other [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remain [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include [[groove metal]] and [[nu metal]], the latter of which often incorporates elements of [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].&lt;!-- Note: Details of the lead section are usually inline cited in the body of the article per [[WP:LEAD]], not the lead section itself.

==Characteristics==
Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Jon Pareles]] writes, "In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Pareles, Jon. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DB113DF933A25754C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Heavy Metal, Weighty Words"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 1988. Retrieved on November 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical band lineup includes a [[drummer]], a [[Heavy metal bass|bassist]], a [[rhythm guitar]]ist, a [[lead guitar]]ist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. [[Keyboard instruments]] are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.&lt;ref name=W25&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep Purple]]'s [[Jon Lord]] played an overdriven [[Hammond organ]]. In 1970, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] used a [[Moog synthesizer]] on ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''; by the 1990s, in "almost every subgenre of heavy metal" [[synthesizer]]s were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/synthesizers-impact-heavy-metal |title=Instigate Sonic Violence: A Not-so-Brief History of the Synthesizer's Impact on Heavy Metal |last=Hannum |first=Terence |date=March 18, 2016 |website=noisey.vice.com |publisher=Vice |access-date=January 7, 2017 |quote=In almost every subgenre of heavy metal, synthesizers held sway. Look at Cynic, who on their progressive death metal opus Focus (1993) had keyboards appear on the album and during live performances, or British gothic doom band My Dying Bride, who relied heavily on synths for their 1993 album, Turn Loose the Swans. American noise band Today is the Day used synthesizers on their 1996 self titled album to powerfully add to their din. Voivod even put synthesizers to use for the first time on 1991's Angel Rat and 1993's The Outer Limits, played by both guitarist Piggy and drummer Away. The 1990s were a gold era for the use of synthesizers in heavy metal, and only paved the way for the further explorations of the new millennia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electric guitar]] and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.&lt;ref name=W23&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy [[fuzz (electric guitar)|fuzz]].&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Robert (1993).

[is created by] [[palm muting]]" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070819035422/http://www.marshallamps.com/images/web%20tuition/lesson4.html "Lesson four- Power chords".] Marshall Amps.&lt;/ref&gt; Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.&lt;ref&gt;''Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity''. By Glenn Pillsbury. Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional "frontman" or [[bandleader]] role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two "contend for dominance" in a spirit of "affectionate rivalry".&lt;ref name=W25/&gt; Heavy metal "demands the subordination of the voice" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an "explicit display of emotion" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Simon Frith]] claims that the metal singer's "tone of voice" is more important than the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Weinstein (2000), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent role of the [[bass guitar|bass]] ‍is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music "heavy".&lt;ref name=W24&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The bass plays a "more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2009), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low [[pedal point]] as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and [[lick (music)|licks]] along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by [[Metallica]]'s [[Cliff Burton]] with his heavy emphasis on bass ‍solos and use of chords while playing the ‍bass in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bassplayer.com/article/the-king-metal/Feb-05/164 "Cliff Burton's Legendary Career: The King of Metal Bass".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106164523/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/the-king-metal/Feb-05/164 |date=November 6, 2015 }} ''Bass Player'', February 2005.

Orion Publishing Group, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of [[heavy metal drumming]] is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the "trifecta of speed, power, and precision".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Michael. [http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2006/08/chris-adler/ "Lamb of God's Chris Adler: More than Meets the Eye"], August 17, 2006. ''Modern Drummer Online''. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy metal drumming "requires an exceptional amount of endurance", and drummers have to develop "considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity&amp;nbsp;... to play the intricate patterns" used in heavy metal.&lt;ref name=Berry&gt;Berry and Gianni (2003), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic metal drumming technique is the [[cymbal choke]], which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.&lt;ref name=W24/&gt; Black metal, death metal and some "mainstream metal" bands "all depend upon [[double bass drumming|double-kicks]] and [[blast beats]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cope |first=Andrew L. |date= 2010|title=Black Sabbath and the Rise of Heavy Metal Music |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd. |page=130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In live performance, [[loudness]]—an "onslaught of sound", in sociologist [[Deena Weinstein]]'s description—is considered vital.&lt;ref name=W23/&gt; In his book, ''Metalheads'', psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as "the sensory equivalent of war".&lt;ref&gt;Arnett (1996), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Following the lead set by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Who]], early heavy metal acts such as [[Blue Cheer]] set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's [[Dickie Peterson|Dick Peterson]] put it, "All we knew was we wanted more power."&lt;ref name=vdqxbw&gt;Walser (1993), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how "excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Sutcliffe quoted in Waksman, Steve. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070618140351/http://www.echo.ucla.edu/volume6-issue2/waksman/waksman3.html "Metal, Punk, and Motörhead: Generic Crossover in the Heart of the Punk Explosion".] ''Echo: A Music-Centered Journal'' 6.2 (Fall 2004). Retrieved on November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that [[melody]] is the main element of [[pop music|pop]] and rhythm is the main focus of [[house music]], powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to "sweep the listener into the sound" and to provide a "shot of youthful vitality".&lt;ref name=W23/&gt;

September 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the sub-genres of symphonic and power metal, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers; bands such as [[Nightwish]], [[Delain]], and [[Within Temptation]] have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments.

===Musical language===

====Rhythm and tempo====
[[File:Heavy rythmic pattern2.png|upright=2|thumb|An example of a rhythmic pattern used in heavy metal. The upper stave is a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] [[rhythm guitar]] part. The lower stave is the drum part.{{Listen|title=Rhythmic Pattern Audio|filename=Heavy rythmic pattern audio.ogg|plain=yes|style=float:right}}]]
The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the "rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency".&lt;ref name=W24/&gt; In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.&lt;ref&gt;"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Brief, abrupt, and detached [[rhythmic cell]]s are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be "slow, even ponderous".&lt;ref name=W24/&gt; By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 [[beats per minute]]) to extremely fast [[blast beat]] tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt;

====Harmony====
One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar [[power chord]].&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main [[interval (music)|interval]], generally the [[perfect fifth]], though an [[octave]] may be added as a doubling of the [[Root (chord)|root]]. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, [[Resultant (organ)|additional low frequency sounds]] are created, which add to the "weight of the sound" and create an effect of "overwhelming power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walser |first1=Robert|date=2014|title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music|page=43 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.melbay.com/guitarglossary.asp Glossary of Guitar Terms]. Mel Bay Publications. Retrieved on November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; power chords are also based on different intervals such as the [[minor third]], [[major third]], [[perfect fourth]], [[diminished fifth]], or [[minor sixth]].&lt;ref&gt;"Shaping Up and Riffing Out: Using Major and Minor Power Chords to Add Colour to Your Parts", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the [[fingerboard|fretboard]].&lt;ref&gt;Schonbrun (2006), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical harmonic structures====
Heavy metal is usually based on [[riff]]s created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of [[pedal point]]s. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding [[chromatic]] or [[tritone]] relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Wolf. "Power Lord—Climbing Chords, Evil Tritones, Giant Callouses", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MH&gt;Dunn, Sam (2005).

Retrieved on March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses "pentatonic and blues-derived features".&lt;ref name="Lilja 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lilja |first=Esa |date=2009 |title=Theory and Analysis of Classic Heavy Metal Harmony |journal=[[Advanced Musicology]] |publisher=IAML Finland |volume=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones—such as C to F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it ''diabolus in musica''—"the devil in music".&lt;ref&gt;The first explicit prohibition of that interval seems to occur with the "development of [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s [[hexachord]]al system which made B flat a [[diatonic]] note, namely as the 4th degree of the hexachordal on F. From then until the end of Renaissance the tritone, nicknamed the 'diabolus in musica', was regarded as an unstable interval and rejected as a consonance" (Sadie, Stanley [1980]. "Tritone", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 1st ed. MacMillan, pp. 154–155. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. See also Arnold, Denis [1983]. "Tritone", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A–J''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}). During the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] and in [[20th-century classical music|modern classical music]] composers have used it freely, exploiting the evil connotations with which it is culturally associated.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of [[pedal point]] as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1985), "Pedal Point", p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are "often quite complex" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is "often very sophisticated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walser |first1=Robert|date=2014|title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music|page=47 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that "heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated" than other music researchers had realized.&lt;ref name="Lilja 2009"/&gt;

====Relationship with classical music====
[[File:Ritchie Blackmore 1977.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A guitarist, Ritchie Blackmore, is shown playing a Fender electric guitar onstage. He has long hair.|[[Ritchie Blackmore]], founder of [[Deep Purple]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], known for the neoclassical approach in his guitar performances.]]
Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&amp;B, the "assemblage of disparate musical styles known&amp;nbsp;... as '[[classical music]]{{'"}} has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days. Also that metal's "most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal."&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article written for ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', Walser stated that the "1980s brought on&amp;nbsp;... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially [[J. S. Bach|Bach]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], by influential guitarists such as [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Marty Friedman]], [[Jason Becker]], [[Uli Jon Roth]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walser, Robert|title=Heavy metal|publisher=Grove Music Online|access-date=March 6, 2010|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo}} {{subscription required|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt Bachmann of [[Believer (band)|Believer]] has stated that "If done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Wilson, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices—classical in the [[art music]] tradition, metal in the [[popular music]] tradition. As [[musicologists]] Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, "Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions'. An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]]. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from "art music'."&lt;ref&gt;See Cook and Dibben (2001), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrical themes===
{{Main|Heavy metal lyrics}}
According to David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically "on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music". They take as an example Sabbath's second album ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970), which "included songs dealing with personal trauma—'[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]' and '[[Fairies Wear Boots]]' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory '[[War Pigs]]' and '[[Hand of Doom (Black Sabbath song)|Hand of Doom]]'."&lt;ref&gt;Hatch and Millward (1989), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic—a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (1991), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Diamond live 2006 Moscow 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Two members from the band King Diamond are shown at a concert performance. From left to right are the singer and an electric guitarist. The singer has white and black face makeup and a top hat. Both are wearing black.|[[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], known for writing conceptual lyrics about horror stories]]
The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to [[Jon Pareles]], "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates&amp;nbsp;... a party without limits&amp;nbsp;... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic."&lt;ref name=JP/&gt; Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjRSmEjs8ZcC&amp;pg=PT245 |year=2007|title=The Rock History Reader |author=Gore, Tipper|chapter=The Cult of Violence|editor=Cateforis, Theo |access-date=August 30, 2015|pages=227–233|isbn=978-0-415-97501-8|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|author-link=Tipper Gore}}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to what they see as advocacy of [[misogyny]] and the occult. During the 1980s, the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.&lt;ref name="See, e 2006 pp. 104"&gt;See, e.g., Ewing and McCann (2006), pp. 104–113&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are "clearly misguided" as these critics have "overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise".&lt;ref&gt;Cope, Andrew L. ''Black Sabbath and the Rise of Heavy Metal Music''. Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2010. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called metal "an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=October 13, 1998|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-10-13/music/nothing-s-shocking/1/|title=Nothing's Shocking|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|access-date=June 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912045843/http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-10-13/music/nothing-s-shocking/1/|archive-date=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, [[Twisted Sister]] frontman [[Dee Snider]] was asked to defend his song "[[Under the Blade (song)|Under the Blade]]" at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the [[PMRC]] alleged that the song was about [[sadomasochism]] and [[rape]]; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostroff |first=Joshua |date=September 18, 2015 |title=Twisted Sister's Dee Snider Blasts Irresponsible Parents On PMRC Hearings' 30th Anniversary |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/18/dee-snider-twisted-sister-pmrc-senate-hearings_n_8020706.html |journal=Huffington Post |access-date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Ozzy Osbourne]] was sued over the lyrics of his song "[[Suicide Solution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elovaara |first=Mika |editor1-last=Abbey |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Helb |editor2-first=Colin|title=Hardcore, Punk and Other Junk: Aggressive Sounds in Contemporary Music|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2014 |page=38 |chapter=Chapter 3: Am I Evil?

For many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments, and [[music video]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Down-the-back long hair is the "most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair "symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home", according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community "the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general".&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, Nader.

Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, "hair metal"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.&lt;ref name="Thompson (2007), p. 135"/&gt; Pioneered by the heavy metal act [[X Japan]] in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as [[visual kei]]—which includes many nonmetal groups—emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Strauss, Neil|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EFD7103DF93BA25755C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Pop Life: End of a Life, End of an Era|date=June 18, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and "extreme heterosexualist ideology". Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of [[air guitar]] is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deena Weinstein]], thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: [[moshing]] and [[stage diving]], which "were imported from the [[punk subculture|punk/hardcore subculture]]".&lt;ref name="Weinstein 2009 228–229"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weinstein |first=Deena |date=2009 |title=Heavy Metal:The Music and its Culture |publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=228–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the "pit" near the stage.

It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, pp. 103, 7, 8, 104&lt;/ref&gt; While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is "tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, pp. 102, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, pp. 181, 207, 294&lt;/ref&gt; Attending live concerts in particular has been called the "holiest of heavy metal communions."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers.

Vol.&amp;nbsp;4, no.&amp;nbsp;1 (2014) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The metal scene has been characterized as a "subculture of alienation", with its own code of authenticity.&lt;ref name=JQS&gt;"Three profiles of heavy metal fans: A taste for sensation and a subculture of alienation", Jeffrey Arnett. In ''Qualitative Sociology''; Publisher Springer Netherlands. {{ISSN|0162-0436}}. Volume 16, Number 4 / December 1993. Pages 423–443.&lt;/ref&gt; This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never "[[selling out|sell out]]".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, pp. 46, 60, 154, 273&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deena Weinstein]] states that for the fans themselves, the code promotes "opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Musician and filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] observes, "Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with" and that metal is "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place".&lt;ref name="Sam Dunn"&gt;Dunn, "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" B000EGEJIY (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as "[[poseur (music)|poseurs]]" "who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".&lt;ref name=JQS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen (1996).

==Etymology==
The origin of the term "heavy metal" in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both [[light metal|light]] and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by [[counterculture|countercultural]] writer [[William S. Burroughs]]. His 1962 novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' includes a character known as "Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid". Burroughs' next novel, ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964), develops the theme, using ''heavy metal'' as a metaphor for addictive drugs: "With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music".&lt;ref&gt;[[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs, William S]].

Metal historian [[Ian Christe]] describes what the components of the term mean in "[[hippie]]speak": "heavy" is roughly synonymous with "potent" or "profound", and "metal" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The word "heavy" in this sense was a basic element of [[beatnik]] and later [[1960s counterculture|countercultural]] [[hippie]] [[slang]], and references to "heavy music"—typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare—were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to [[Vanilla Fudge]]. [[Iron Butterfly]]'s debut album, released in early 1968, was titled ''[[Heavy (Iron Butterfly album)|Heavy]]''. The first use of "heavy metal" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] song "[[Born to Be Wild]]", also released that year:&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; "I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/And the feelin' that I'm under."

An early documented use of the phrase in [[rock criticism]] appears in Sandy Pearlman's February 1967 ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy]]'' review of [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Got Live If You Want It! (album)|Got Live If You Want It]]'' (1966), albeit as a description of the sound rather than as a genre: "On this album the Stones go metal. Technology is in the saddle—as an ideal and as a method."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Deena|date=November 12, 2013|title=Just So Stories: How Heavy Metal Got Its Name—A Cautionary Tale|pages=36–51|journal=Rock Music Studies|volume=1|doi=10.1080/19401159.2013.846655|s2cid=191362285|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Pearlman goes on to say, "A mechanically hysterical audience is matched to a mechanically hysterical sound.

Most mechanical … the to-date definitive metal song: 'Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?,' as hysterical and tense as can be … A sloppy performance—but never flaccid. Some bad detail, but lots of tension. It's a mechanical conception and realization (like all metal songs)—with the instruments and Mick's voice densely organized into hard, sharp-edged planes of sound: a construction of aural surfaces and regular surfaced planes, a planar conception, the product of a mechanistic discipline, with an emphasis upon the geometrical organization of percussive sounds."&lt;ref name="Pearlman"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pearlman|first=Sandy|author-link=Sandy Pearlman|date=February 1967|issue=8|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/crawdaddy/the-four-tops/crawdaddy-classics-live-the-four-tops-and-the-roll/|title=Live! The Four Tops and The Rolling Stones|magazine=[[Crawdaddy]]|via=[[Paste (magazine)|pastemagazine.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Another appears in the May 11, 1968, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in which [[Barry Gifford]] wrote about the album ''[[A Long Time Comin']]'' by U.S. band [[Electric Flag]]: "Nobody who's been listening to [[Mike Bloomfield]]—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock."&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Barry. ''Rolling Stone'', May 11, 1968, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1970 [[Lucian Truscott IV|Lucian K. Truscott IV]] reviewing ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' for the [[Village Voice]] described the sound as "heavy" and made comparisons with [[Blue Cheer]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/these-led-zeppelin-guys-are-surprisingly-good-6659450 "Riffs"]. [[Lucian Truscott#Family|Lucian K. Truscott IV]] for the [[Village Voice]]. January 22, 1970. "Led Zeppelin, popularly looked on as an English version of Blue Cheer, given to Vanilla Fudgeish heavy-handedness in all that it does, has come out with a good album, 'Led Zeppelin II' (Atlantic SD 8236). Sure, it's 'heavy.' Sure, it's volume-rock at a time when the trend seems to be toward acoustical niceties of country music".&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic [[Mike Saunders]]. In the November 12, 1970 issue of ''Rolling Stone'', he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]: "''[[As Safe as Yesterday Is|Safe as Yesterday Is]],'' their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs&amp;nbsp;... and one monumental pile of refuse". He described the band's latest, [[Humble Pie (album)|self-titled release]] as "more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Saunders, Mike |date=November 12, 1970 |title=Humble Pie: 'Town and Country' (review) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130055912/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/158628/review/5944670/town_and_country |work=Rolling Stone |url-status=dead |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/158628/review/5944670/town_and_country |archive-date=November 30, 2007 |access-date=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of [[Sir Lord Baltimore]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]]'' in the May 1971 ''[[Creem]]'', Saunders wrote, "Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saunders, Mike |date=May 1971 |url=http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/SirLordBaltimore/KingdomCome001.html |title=Sir Lord Baltimore's 'Kingdom Come' (review) |work=[[Creem]] |access-date=March 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308145737/http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/SirLordBaltimore/KingdomCome001.html |archive-date=March 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creem'' critic [[Lester Bangs]] is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (1991), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Through the decade, ''heavy metal'' was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead ''New York Times'' popular music critic [[John Rockwell]] described what he called "heavy-metal rock" as "brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs",&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, John. ''New York Times'', February 4, 1979, p. D22&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a different article, as "a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers".&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, John. ''New York Times'', August 13, 1979, p. C16&lt;/ref&gt;

Coined by [[Black Sabbath]] drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]], "downer rock" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and [[Bloodrock]]. ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of [[Quaaludes]] and the drinking of wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Lost Pioneers of Heavy Metal |last=Sleazegrinder |magazine=Classic Rock |date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the term would be replaced by "heavy metal".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Holm-Hudson, ''Progressive Rock Reconsidered'', (Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|0-8153-3715-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier on, as "heavy metal" emerged partially from heavy psychedelic rock, also known as [[acid rock]], "acid rock" was often used interchangeably with "heavy metal" and "[[hard rock]]". "Acid rock" generally describes heavy, hard, or raw psychedelic rock. Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that "the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous",&lt;ref&gt;Waksman (2001), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; while percussionist John Beck defined "acid rock" as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=John H.|title=Encyclopedia of Percussion|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U83AgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22acid+rock%22+%22harder%22&amp;pg=PA335|isbn=978-1-317-74768-0|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from "acid rock", the terms "heavy metal" and "hard rock" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Du Noyer (2003), pp. 96, 78&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 1983 ''Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' includes this passage: "known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, [[Aerosmith]] was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies".&lt;ref&gt;Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antecedents: 1950s to late 1960s===
{{See also|Blues rock|psychedelic rock|acid rock|garage rock}}
Heavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s [[Memphis blues]] [[guitarist]]s such as [[Joe Hill Louis]], [[Willie Johnson (guitarist)|Willie Johnson]], and particularly [[Pat Hare]],&lt;ref name=rolling_memphis&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Jim |title=The Rolling Stone illustrated history of rock &amp; roll |publisher=Rolling Stone |year=1980 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-51322-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/rollingstoneillu00mill |url-access=registration |access-date=July 5, 2012 |quote=Black country bluesmen made raw, heavily amplified boogie records of their own, especially in Memphis, where guitarists like Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson (with the early Howlin' Wolf band) and Pat Hare (with Little Junior Parker) played driving rhythms and scorching, distorted solos that might be counted the distant ancestors of heavy metal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; who captured a "grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound" on records such as [[James Cotton]]'s "[[:File:James Cotton - Cotton Crop Blues.ogg|Cotton Crop Blues]]" (1954);&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], "Church of the Sonic Guitar", pp.&amp;nbsp;13–38 in Anthony DeCurtis, ''Present Tense'', [[Duke University Press]], 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27. {{ISBN|0-8223-1265-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the late 1950s instrumentals of [[Link Wray]], particularly "[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]" (1958);&lt;ref&gt;Strong (2004), p. 1693; Buckley (2003), p. 1187&lt;/ref&gt; the early 1960s [[surf music|surf rock]] of [[Dick Dale]], including "[[Let's Go Trippin']]" (1961) and "[[Misirlou]]" (1962); and [[The Kingsmen]]'s version of "[[Louie Louie]]" (1963) which made it a [[garage rock]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley (2003) p. 1144.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American [[blues music]] was a major influence on the early [[British rock]]ers of the era. Bands like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Yardbirds]] developed [[blues rock]] by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the [[tempo]]s. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands—and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn—developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.&lt;ref name=vdqxbw/&gt; [[The Kinks]] played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit "[[You Really Got Me]]".&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (1991), p. 18; Walser (1993), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to The Kinks' [[Dave Davies]], other guitarists such as [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] and The Yardbirds' [[Jeff Beck]] were experimenting with feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson (2006), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=the-yardbirds-mn0000489303|pure_url=yes}} "The Yardbirds"]. Richie Unterberger. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved August 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.&lt;ref name=eyaqji&gt;Walser (1993), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's "bigger-louder-wall-of-[[Marshall Amplification#Marshall Stack|Marshalls]]" approach was seminal to the development of the later heavy metal sound.&lt;ref&gt;McMichael (2004), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of loud and heavy blues rock with [[psychedelic rock]] and [[acid rock]] formed much of the original basis for heavy metal.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (1991), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as "[[acid rock]]" was particularly influential on heavy metal; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock,&lt;ref name=AMgenre&gt;{{AllMusic|class=style|id=acid-rock-ma0000012327}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound. Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its "rawest and most intense," emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the [[psychedelic experience]] rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia.&lt;ref name="bisbort"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bisbort|first1=Alan|last2=Puterbaugh|first2=Parke|title=Rhino's Psychedelic Trip|date=2000|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsa9NUlj9FsC&amp;q=%22acid+rock%22+rawer&amp;pg=PA31|access-date=August 5, 2017|isbn=9780879306267}}&lt;/ref&gt; In  contrast to more idyllic or whimsical pop psychedelic rock, American acid rock [[garage bands]] such as the [[13th Floor Elevators]] epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker and more psychotic psychedelic rock sound known as acid rock, a sound characterized by [[Drone (music)|droning]] guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators' sound in particular featured yelping vocals and "occasionally demented" lyrics.&lt;ref name="unterberger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music|date=2001|publisher=Hal Corporation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR7MdpuSlAEC&amp;q=%22occasionally+demented+lyrics%22&amp;pg=PT384|access-date=August 5, 2017|isbn=9780879306274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Hoffman notes that: "[Psychedelic rock] was sometimes referred to as 'acid rock'. The latter label was applied to a pounding, [[hard rock]] variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s [[garage-punk]] movement. ... When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Frank (ed.) (2004). ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound'', Routledge, p. 1725 {{ISBN|1135949506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio [[Cream (band)|Cream]], who derived a massive, heavy sound from [[unison]] riffing between guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] and bassist [[Jack Bruce]], as well as [[Ginger Baker]]'s double bass drumming.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton (2003), pp. 232–33&lt;/ref&gt; Their first two LPs, ''[[Fresh Cream]]'' (1966) and ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal. [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s debut album, ''[[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]]'' (1967), was also highly influential. [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]'s virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, "[[Purple Haze]]", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit.&lt;ref name=vdqxbw/&gt; [[Vanilla Fudge]], whose [[Vanilla Fudge (album)|first album]] also came out in 1967, has been called "one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal",&lt;ref name=vanillafudge&gt;{{cite web |author=Huey, Steve |title=Vanilla Fudge (Biography) |website=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=vanilla-fudge-mn0000311674|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group.&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Ray Broadus|last2=Browne|first2=Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|date=2001|publisher=Popular Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;q=vanilla+fudge+heavy+metal&amp;pg=PA373|isbn=9780879728212}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created "loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements" of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to "epic proportions" and "bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze."&lt;ref name=vanillafudge/&gt;

During the late 1960s, many psychedelic singers, such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], began to create outlandish, theatrical and often [[macabre]] performances; which in itself became incredibly influential to many metal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Unterberger, Ritchie |title=Arthur Brown (Biography) |website=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=arthur-brown-mn0000510278|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polly Marshall, ''The God of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown'', {{ISBN|0-946719-77-2}}, SAF Publishing, 2005, page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polly Marshall, ''The God of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown'', {{ISBN|0-946719-77-2}}, SAF Publishing, 2005, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The American psychedelic rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]], who opened for early heavy metal influencers such as Vanilla Fudge and the Yardbirds, portrayed themselves as practitioners of [[witchcraft]] or [[black magic]], using dark—[[Satanism|Satanic]] or [[occult]]—imagery in their lyrics, album art, and live performances. Live shows consisted of elaborate, theatrical "[[Black Mass|Satanic rites]]". Coven's 1969 debut album, ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls]]'', featured imagery of skulls, [[black mass]]es, [[inverted cross]]es, and [[Satan]] worship, and both the album artwork and the band's live performances marked the first appearances in rock music of the [[sign of the horns]], which would later become an important gesture in heavy metal culture.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heigl|first1=Alex|title=The Overwhelming (and Overlooked) Darkness of Jinx Dawson and Coven|url=http://people.com/music/jinx-dawson-coven-overlooked-heavy-metal-influencers/|website=People.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pattersonblackmetal"/&gt; At the same time in England, the band [[Black Widow (band)|Black Widow]] were also among the first psychedelic rock bands to use occult and Satanic imagery and lyrics, though both Black Widow and Coven's lyrical and thematic influences on heavy metal were quickly overshadowed by the darker and heavier sounds of [[Black Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pattersonblackmetal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Dayal|title=Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult|date=2013|publisher=Feral House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kIxCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=coven+%22heavy+metal%22&amp;pg=PA3|isbn=9781936239764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band. Most credit either [[Led Zeppelin]] or [[Black Sabbath]], with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both. [[Deep Purple]], the third band in what is sometimes considered the "unholy trinity" of heavy metal (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple), fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction.&lt;ref name="Charlton 2003, p. 241"&gt;Charlton (2003), p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; A few commentators—mainly American—argue for other groups including [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] or [[Blue Cheer]] as the first to play heavy metal.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, the San Francisco band [[Blue Cheer]] released a cover of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s classic "[[Summertime Blues]]", from their debut album ''[[Vincebus Eruptum]]'', that many consider the first true heavy metal recording.&lt;ref&gt;McCleary (2004), pp. 240, 506.&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] released its [[steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|self-titled debut album]], including "[[Born to Be Wild]]", which refers to "heavy metal thunder" in describing a motorcycle. In July, the [[Jeff Beck Group]], whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record: ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' featured some of the "most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time," breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Santoro, quoted in Carson (2001), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Page's new band, [[Led Zeppelin]], made its live debut in Denmark (billed as The New Yardbirds).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/show/september-7-1968|title=Led Zeppelin Teen-Clubs, Box 45, Egegaard Skole – September 7, 1968|website=Led Zeppelin – Official Website|language=en|access-date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]], released in November, included "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]", then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band.&lt;ref&gt;Blake (1997), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Pretty Things]]' [[rock opera]] ''[[S.F.

In January 1969, Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released and reached number 10 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart. In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, [[Grand Funk Railroad]], played the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta Pop Festival]]. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by [[Leslie West]] released ''[[Mountain (Leslie West album)|Mountain]]'', an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals.

[[Birmingham]]'s Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an [[industrial accident]] guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] suffered before cofounding the band.

On the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was [[Grand Funk Railroad]], described as "the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring".&lt;ref&gt;Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as [[Sir Lord Baltimore]] (''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]],'' 1970), [[Blue Öyster Cult]] (''[[Blue Öyster Cult (album)|Blue Öyster Cult]]'', 1972), [[Aerosmith]] (''[[Aerosmith (album)|Aerosmith]]'', 1973) and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] (''[[Kiss (Kiss album)|Kiss]]'', 1974). Sir Lord Baltimore's 1970 debut album and both [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]'s [[As Safe As Yesterday Is|debut]] and [[Humble Pie (album)|self-titled third album]] were all among the first albums to be described in print as "heavy metal", with ''[[As Safe As Yesterday Is]]'' being referred to by the term "heavy metal" in a 1970 review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Mike.

In Germany, [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] debuted with ''[[Lonesome Crow]]'' in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's highly influential album ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (1972), left the band in 1975 to form [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] with [[Ronnie James Dio]], singer and bassist for blues rock band [[Elf (band)|Elf]] and future vocalist for Black Sabbath and heavy metal band [[Dio (band)|Dio]]. Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio would expand on the mystical and [[fantasy]]-based lyrics and themes sometimes found in heavy metal, pioneering both [[power metal]] and [[neoclassical metal]].&lt;ref name="Eduardo Rivadavia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rainbow-mn0000391933/biography |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |title=Rainbow |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.&lt;ref name=eyaqji/&gt;

As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as "heavy metal" or simply as "hard rock". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. [[AC/DC]], which debuted with ''[[High Voltage (Australian album)|High Voltage]]'' in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 ''Rolling Stone'' encyclopedia entry begins, "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC".&lt;ref&gt;Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today. ... [They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal".&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2001), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition".&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Black Sabbath's audience was ... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow. ... Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-[[blues]]y, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.&lt;ref name="Walser 1993, p. 6"/&gt; While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice,&lt;ref name=gnwtey&gt;Walser (1993), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic [[Robert Christgau]] described it as "dull and decadent ... dim-witted, amoral exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;Christgau (1981), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980s===
[[File:Iron Maiden - bass and guitars 30nov2006.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Four members of Iron Maiden are shown in concert. From left to right are a bass guitarist and then three electric guitarists. All members shown have long hair.|[[Iron Maiden]], one of the central bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]]]]
[[Punk rock]] emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, [[disco]], and more mainstream rock.&lt;ref name=gnwtey/&gt; With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and "[[lo-fi (music)|lo-fi]]", [[do it yourself]] ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), pp. 30, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motörhead]], founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music papers such as the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' took notice, with ''Sounds'' writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the "New Wave of British Heavy Metal".&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; NWOBHM bands including [[Iron Maiden]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], and [[Def Leppard]] re-energized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Judas Priest |author1=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |author2=Prato, Greg |website=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=judas-priest-mn0000246611|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=April 30, 2007}} {{cite web |title=Genre—New Wave of British Heavy Metal |website=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=new-wave-of-british-heavy-metal-ma0000004491|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This seemed to be the resurgence of heavy metal," noted [[Ronnie James Dio]], who joined Black Sabbath in 1979. "I've never thought there was a ''desurgence'' of heavy metal – if that's a word! – but it was important to me that, yet again ''[after [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]]'', I could be involved in something that was paving the way for those who are going to come after me."&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie James Dio interview with [[Tommy Vance]] for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Friday Rock Show]]''; broadcast on August 21, 1987; transcribed by editor Peter Scott for Sabbath [[fanzine]] ''Southern Cross'' #11, October 1996, p27&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, NWOBHM bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]] would have a significant influence on metal's development.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (1991), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with the live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''.&lt;ref name="RC1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burridge |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Burridge (writer) |date=April 1991 |title=Motörhead |journal=[[Record Collector]] |issue=140 |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple broke up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin split following drummer [[John Bonham]]'s death in 1980. Black Sabbath were plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition from [[Never Say Die! Tour (Black Sabbath)|their opening band]], [[Van Halen]].&lt;ref&gt;Popoff (2011), ''Black Sabbath FAQ: All That's Left to Know on the First Name in Metal'' P. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Van Halen]] established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era. His solo on "[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]", from the band's [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled 1978 album]], is considered a milestone.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Van Halen's sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track "[[Beat It]]" by [[Michael Jackson]] (a U.S. number 1 in February 1983).&lt;ref&gt;"Van Halen – Van Halen." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. October 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.'s [[Sunset Strip]], bands such as [[Motley Crue]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Ratt]], and [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Rivadavia, Eduardo. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=quiet-riot-mn0000859868|pure_url=yes}} "Quiet Riot"]. AllMusic.

In the wake of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]'' (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on [[MTV]], which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Def Leppard's videos for ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the ''Billboard'' chart with ''[[Metal Health]]'' (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 [[US Festival]] in California, where the "heavy metal day" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (1991), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (in 1981) and ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, ''Billboard'' declared, "Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female".&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), pp. 12–13, 182 n. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, [[music television]], and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] and acts from the East Coast like [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, [[New Jersey]]'s [[Bon Jovi]] became enormously successful with its third album, ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band [[Europe (band)|Europe]] became international stars with ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1986). Its [[The Final Countdown (song)|title track]] hit number 1 in 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rock Group Europe Plan Comeback |work=BBC News |date=October 3, 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3162506.stm |access-date=November 28, 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, MTV launched a show, ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'', devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as "light metal" or "hair metal".&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 14; Christe (2003), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

One band that reached diverse audiences was [[Guns N' Roses]]. In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much more raw and dangerous. With the release of their chart-topping ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), they "recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years".&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Jane's Addiction]] emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''. Reviewing the album, ''Rolling Stone'' declared, "as much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Jane's Addiction: ''Nothing's Shocking'' |author=Steve Pond |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=October 20, 1988 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/janesaddiction/albums/album/119704/review/5942383/nothings_shocking |access-date=May 1, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002080218/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/janesaddiction/albums/album/119704/review/5942383/nothings_shocking |archive-date=October 2, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was one of the first to be identified with the "[[alternative metal]]" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands like New York City's [[Winger (band)|Winger]] and New Jersey's [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.&lt;ref name=Covach&gt;Covach, John.

Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of [[AllMusic]], as well as critic [[Rockdetector|Garry Sharpe-Young]]. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: [[thrash metal]], [[death metal]], [[black metal]], [[power metal]], and the related subgenres of [[doom metal|doom]] and [[gothic metal]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe-Young (2007), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a review in ''Rolling Stone'' suggested retiring the term "heavy metal" as the genre was "ridiculously vague".&lt;ref name="rs-1990"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108121842/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/anthrax/albums/album/302316/review/5946559/persistence_of_time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/anthrax/albums/album/302316/review/5946559/persistence_of_time|access-date=July 17, 2015|archive-date=January 8, 2008|title=Anthrax: Persistence of Time|last=Neely|first=Kim|date=October 4, 1990|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that the term only fueled "misperceptions of rock &amp; roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as [[Ratt]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and [[Mother Love Bone]]" sound the same.&lt;ref name="rs-1990" /&gt;

The subgenre was popularized by the "Big Four of Thrash": [[Metallica]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Three German bands, [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], played a central role in bringing the style to Europe. Others, including San Francisco Bay Area's [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], New Jersey's [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], and Brazil's [[Sepultura]] and [[Sarcófago]], also had a significant impact. Although thrash began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the ''Billboard'' album chart in 1986 with ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', the genre's first platinum record.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls (1997), p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the band's ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.&lt;ref&gt;[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Metallica|chart=all}} "Metallica—Artist Chart History"]; [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Megadeth|chart=all}} "Megadeth—Artist Chart History"]; [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Anthrax|chart=all}} "Anthrax—Artist Chart History"].

Though less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar [[timbre]]s, and for including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipov (2012), p. 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Slayer attracted a following among [[white power skinhead|far-right skinheads]], and accusations of promoting violence and [[Nazism|Nazi]] themes have dogged the band.&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), p. 30; O'Neil (2001), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of [[extreme metal]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2011), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Walser (1993), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica's [[Metallica (album)|self-titled 1991 album]] topped the ''Billboard'' chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-08-31/billboard-200 |title=Top 200 Albums|work=Billboard|access-date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the band established international following.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (2011), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Megadeth's ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'' (1992) debuted at number two,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1992-08-01/billboard-200 |title=Top 200 Albums|work=Billboard|access-date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1993-06-12/billboard-200 |title=Top 200 Albums|work=Billboard|access-date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.&lt;ref&gt;[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=testament|chart=all}} Billboard 200 Chart Position: Testament – ''Ritual'', chart date: May 30, 1992]; [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=sepultura|chart=all}} Billboard 200 Chart Position: Sepultura – ''Chaos A.D.'', chart date: 1993-11-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. "Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal," according to MTV News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml The Greatest Metal Bands of All Time—Slayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718224746/http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml |date=July 18, 2006 }}.

Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo ''Death Metal'' and the song "Death Metal", from its 1985 debut album ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]'' (1985). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.&lt;ref&gt;Ekeroth, Daniel (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Death metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets.&lt;ref name=MS28&gt;Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; One major exception to this rule was [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]]'s [[Glen Benton]], who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage.

====Black metal====

The first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by the United Kingdom's [[Venom (band)|Venom]], Denmark's [[Mercyful Fate]], Switzerland's [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]], and Sweden's [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Burzum]] were heading a second wave.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid [[tremolo picking]], a dark atmosphere&lt;ref name="Genre—Death Metal/Black Metal"/&gt; and intentionally lo-fi production, often with ambient noise and background hiss.&lt;ref&gt;Jurek, Thom.

Satanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient [[paganism]], promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values.&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous black metal bands also "experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde".&lt;ref name=VS/&gt; [[Darkthrone]] drummer [[Fenriz]] explains, "It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff.

Although bands such as [[Sarcófago]] had been donning [[corpsepaint]], by 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing [[corpsepaint]]; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the [[Viking metal]] and [[folk metal]] movements and [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), pp. 271, 321, 326&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 murder of Mayhem's [[Euronymous]] by Burzum's [[Varg Vikernes]] provoked intensive media coverage.&lt;ref name=Campion/&gt; Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating,&lt;ref&gt;Vikernes, Varg.

The 1991 release of ''[[Forest of Equilibrium]]'', the debut album by UK band [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], helped spark a new wave of doom metal. During the same period, the [[death/doom|doom-death]] fusion style of British bands [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[My Dying Bride]], and [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]] gave rise to European gothic metal,&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe-Young (2007), pp. 246, 275; see also Stéphane Leguay, "Metal Gothique" in ''Carnets Noirs'', éditions E-dite, 3e édition, 2006, {{ISBN|2-84608-176-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's [[Theatre of Tragedy]] and [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]]. New York's [[Type O Negative]] introduced an American take on the style.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe-Young (2007), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[sludge metal]], mixing doom and hardcore, emerged in the late 1980s—[[Eyehategod]] and [[Crowbar (US band)|Crowbar]] were leaders in a [[Music of New Orleans#Heavy metal|major Louisiana sludge scene]]. Early in the next decade, California's [[Kyuss]] and [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]], inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of [[stoner metal]],&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; while Seattle's [[Earth (American band)|Earth]] helped develop the [[drone metal]] subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;Jackowiak, Jason.

The era of heavy metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and other [[grunge]] bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of [[alternative rock]].&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), pp. 304–6; Weinstein (1991), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their "flashy and virtuosic solos" and "appearance-driven" [[MTV]] orientation.&lt;ref name=Covach/&gt;

Glam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge,&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash [[groove metal]] of [[Pantera]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]].&lt;ref&gt;Birchmeier, Jason.

Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative musical festival [[Lollapalooza]] founded by [[Jane's Addiction]] singer [[Perry Farrell]]. While this prompted a backlash among some long-time fans,&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term "alternative metal".&lt;ref name=alternativemetal&gt;{{cite web |title=Genre—Alternative Metal |website=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=style|id=alternative-metal-ma0000012328|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as [[Soundgarden]], credited as making a "place for heavy metal in alternative rock",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |title=Soundgarden (Biography) |website=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=soundgarden-mn0000001098|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alice in Chains]] were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: [[Faith No More]] combined their alternative rock sound with punk, [[funk]], metal, and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]; [[Primus (band)|Primus]] joined elements of funk, punk, [[thrash metal]], and [[experimental music]]; [[Tool (band)|Tool]] mixed metal and [[progressive rock]]; bands such as [[Fear Factory]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] began incorporating metal into their [[industrial music|industrial sound]], and vice versa, respectively; and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie—also identified with alt-metal—significant, if partial, exceptions).&lt;ref name=alternativemetal/&gt; Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented "the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), pp. 324–25&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed "nu metal", bands such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Papa Roach]], [[P.O.D.]], [[Korn]] and [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] incorporated elements ranging from [[death metal]] to hip hop, often including [[DJ]]s and [[Rapping|rap]]-style vocals. The mix demonstrated that "pancultural metal could pay off".&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of [[Ozzfest]], which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''Billboard'' noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the United States, nearly three times as many as ten years before.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style.&lt;ref&gt;Christe (2003), p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as Korn or Limp Bizkit retained substantial followings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D'angelo |first=Joe |title=Nu Metal Meltdown |publisher=MTV.com |date=January 24, 2003 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal_meltdown/news_feature_030124/index.jhtml |access-date=March 28, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208190614/http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal_meltdown/news_feature_030124/index.jhtml |archive-date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kittie at the Cathouse in Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|220px|All-female heavy metal band [[Kittie]] performing in 2008]]

The history of women in heavy metal can be traced back as far as the 1970s when the band Genesis, the forerunner of [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]], was formed in 1973. Another hard rock band that featured all-female members, [[The Runaways]], was founded in 1975; two members, [[Joan Jett]] and [[Lita Ford]], later had successful solo careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/lita-ford-17169494|title=Lita Ford|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323060710/https://www.biography.com/people/lita-ford-17169494|archive-date=March 23, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, with the rise of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], the band [[Girlschool]] was founded, later collaborating with [[Motörhead]] under the pseudonym [[Headgirl]] in 1980. Starting in 1984, [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]], dubbed "the Metal Queen", reached success across Europe leading the German band [[Warlock (band)|Warlock]], before starting her solo career.

In 1994, [[Liv Kristine]] joined Norwegian [[gothic metal]] band [[Theatre of Tragedy]], providing 'angelic'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napalmrecords.com/band/?bandID=40&amp;alphabetID=21 |title=Artists – LIv Kristine |publisher=[[Napalm Records]] |date=2012 |access-date=16 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416174541/http://www.napalmrecords.com/band/?bandID=40&amp;alphabetID=21 |archive-date=16 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; female clean vocals to contrast with male [[Death growl|death growls]].  In 1996, Finnish band [[Nightwish]] was founded, featuring [[Tarja Turunen]]'s vocals. This was followed by more women fronting heavy metal bands, such as [[Halestorm]], [[In This Moment]], [[Within Temptation]], [[Arch Enemy]], and [[Epica (band)|Epica]] among others.

In Japan, the 2010s brought a boom of all-female metal bands including [[Destrose]], [[Aldious]], [[Mary's Blood]], [[Cyntia]], and [[Lovebites (band)|Lovebites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The DESTROSE Connection ~The Prologue~ | work = JaME | url = https://www.jame-world.com/en/article/136224-the-destrose-connection-the-prologue.html| date= March 17, 2016| access-date = August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 浜田麻里からLOVEBITESまでーーガールズHR/HM、波乱万丈の30年史 | url = https://realsound.jp/2017/11/post-125465.html |date=November 7, 2017| work = Real Sound | language = ja | access-date = August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liv Kristine was featured on the title track of [[Cradle of Filth]]'s 2004 album [[Nymphetamine]] which was nominated for the 2004 [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-12-07-grammy-nominee-list_x.htm |title=usatoday.com – Grammy Award Nominees in Top Categories |date=12 July 2004 |work=usatoday.com |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Halestorm won the Grammy in the combined category of Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for "[[Love Bites (So Do I)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-12-07-grammy-nominee-list_x.htm |title=usatoday.com – Grammy Award Nominees in Top Categories |date=12 July 2004 |work=usatoday.com |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2021, In This Moment, [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]] and [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]] were both nominated in the Best Metal Performance category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pasbani|first=Robert|date=2020-11-24|title=Here Are The Nominees For Best Metal Performance at the 2021 GRAMMYs|url=https://metalinjection.net/metal-in-the-mainstream/here-are-the-nominees-for-best-metal-performance-at-the-2021-grammys|access-date=2021-01-15|website=Metal Injection|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have also had an important role behind the scenes, such as [[Gaby Hoffmann (manager)|Gaby Hoffmann]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]]. In 1981, Hoffmann helped [[Don Dokken]] acquire his first record deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelwagener.com/html/bio.html|title=Michael Wagener's Biography|website=www.michaelwagener.com|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann also became the manager of [[Accept (band)|Accept]] in 1981 and wrote songs under the pseudonym of "Deaffy" for many of band's studio albums. Vocalist [[Mark Tornillo]] stated that Hoffmann still had some influence in songwriting on their later albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/accepts-mark-tornillo-says-fans-can-expect-a-little-more-diversity-on-blind-rage/|title=ACCEPT's MARK TORNILLO Says Fans Can Expect 'A Little More Diversity' On 'Blind Rage'|date=April 4, 2014|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=March 23, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osbourne, the wife and manager of [[Ozzy Osbourne]], founded the ''[[Ozzfest]]'' music festival and managed several bands, including Motörhead, [[Coal Chamber]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], Lita Ford and [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Interview: Sharon Osbourne|url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,495951,00.html|website=The Guardian|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexism ===
The popular media and academia have long charged heavy metal with sexism and [[misogyny]]. In the 1980s, American conservative groups like the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC) and the [[Parent Teacher Association]] (PTA) coopted feminist views on anti-woman violence to form attacks on metal's rhetoric and imagery.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; According to [[Robert Christgau]] in 2001, metal, along with hip hop, have made "reflexive and violent sexism … current in the music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Dansby|first=Andrew|date=February 16, 2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/critic-christgau-wraps-the-90s-249682/|title=Critic Christgau Wraps the '90s|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 11, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus among media and culture scholars posits sexism's existence, to varying degrees, across different subgenres and scenes of metal. In ''Gender, Metal and the Media'' (2016), British sociologist and music academic Rosemary Lucy Hill cites a variety of historical research and finds, in summary, "sexist attitudes and behaviours of peers at hard rock and metal events; symbolic violence, such as the violently misogynistic imagery in artwork and lyrics; women being faced with a barrage of questions to prove the authenticity of their fandom; the dominance of men in bands and prejudice faced by women musicians; and women fans being represented in the media as groupies, more interested in the musician than the music". Other academics find that femininity is largely suppressed in metal culture, and that metal listeners are more likely to subscribe to misogynistic attitudes and stereotyping of [[gender role]]s, more so than in other music genres, with many of these findings corroborated by interviews with female participants.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Rosemary Lucy|date=January 2016|chapter=Metal and Sexism|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309760064|access-date=February 15, 2020|title=Gender, Metal and the Media|pages=133–158|chapter-url-access=registration|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-55441-3_6|isbn=978-1-137-55440-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such claims, debates in the metal media have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that "understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised." Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she finds that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

In 2018, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled "Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?", interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some talked about a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking, and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of [[Sepultura]] and wife of the band's former frontman [[Max Cavalera]], said that since 1996 she has received misogynistic hate-mail and death threats from fans accusing her of causing Max's departure from the group. She added that, "Women take a lot of crap. This whole [[#metoo]] thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair. Women have always been pushed to the back. I personally think it's still difficult for women in the industry today, because there's not a lot of them, even in bands." In her article, Goodman also cited disproportionate gender figures in ''Metal Hammer''{{'}}s [[Facebook]] page – 75 percent of [[Like (Facebook)|likes]] being from men, as opposed to 25 percent from women – and in bands playing the main stage at the 2018 [[Bloodstock Open Air]] festival – [[Nightwish]] was the only act of the 17 with a female member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Goodman|first=Eleanor|date=February 12, 2018|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/does-metal-have-a-sexism-problem|title=Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|access-date=February 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
