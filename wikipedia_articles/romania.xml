The united armies of the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] expelled the Ottoman troops from Central Europe between 1684 and 1699, and the Principality of Transylvania was integrated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=79}} The Habsburgs supported the Catholic clergy and persuaded the Orthodox Romanian prelates to accept the [[church union|union with the Roman Catholic Church]] in 1699.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=42}} The Church Union strengthened the Romanian intellectuals' devotion to their Roman heritage.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=60}} The Orthodox Church was restored in Transylvania only after Orthodox monks stirred up revolts in 1744 and 1759.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=61}} The organization of the [[Transylvanian Military Frontier]] caused further disturbances, [[Siculicidium|especially among the Székelys in 1764]].{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=432–434}}

[[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and other leaders of the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolutions in Moldavia]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachia]] demanded the emancipation of the peasants and the union of the two principalities, but Russian and Ottoman troops crushed their revolt.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|pp=96–97}} The Wallachian revolutionists were the first to adopt the blue, yellow and red [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] as the [[Flag of Romania|national flag]].{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=100}} In Transylvania, most Romanians supported the imperial government against the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolutionaries]] after the Diet passed a law concerning the union of Transylvania and Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=100}} Bishop [[Andrei Șaguna]] proposed the unification of the Romanians of the Habsburg Monarchy in a separate duchy, but the central government refused to change the internal borders.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=99}}

The Transylvanian Romanians and Saxons wanted to maintain the separate status of Transylvania in the Habsburg Monarchy, but the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]] brought about the union of the province with Hungary in&amp;nbsp;1867.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=157}} Ethnic Romanian politicians sharply opposed the Hungarian government's attempts to transform Hungary into a national state, especially the laws prescribing the obligatory teaching of Hungarian.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=118}} Leaders of the [[Romanian National Party]] proposed the federalisation of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Romanian intellectuals established a cultural association to promote the use of Romanian.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=145}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=118–119}}

As Romania's foreign debt increased sharply between 1977 and 1981 (from US$3&amp;nbsp;billion to $10&amp;nbsp;billion),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deletant |first=Dennis |title=New Evidence on Romania and the Warsaw Pact, 1955–1989 |publisher=Cold War International History Project e-Dossier Series |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACF368.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117154720/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACF368.pdf |archive-date=17 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of international financial organisations—such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]—grew, gradually conflicting with Ceaușescu's [[autocracy|autocratic]] rule. He eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity steps]] that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. The process succeeded in repaying all of Romania's foreign government debt in 1989. At the same time, Ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|cult of personality]], which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution, together with his wife, in the violent [[Romanian Revolution]] of December 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured. The charges for which they were executed were, among others, genocide by starvation.

The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties, including most notably the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PDSR then PSD) and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD and subsequently PDL). The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments, with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then, there have been several other democratic changes of government: in 1996 [[Emil Constantinescu]] was elected president, in 2000 Iliescu returned to power, while [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-6689374-presa-internationala-despre-alegerile-din-romania-traian-basescu-castigat-limita-romanii-mici-sperante-dezghete-ajutorul-fmi.htm Presa internationala despre alegerile din Romania: Traian Basescu a castigat la limita; Romanii au mici sperante sa se dezghete ajutorul de la FMI – International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002223/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-6689374-presa-internationala-despre-alegerile-din-romania-traian-basescu-castigat-limita-romanii-mici-sperante-dezghete-ajutorul-fmi.htm |date=4 March 2016}}.

The post–1989 period is also characterised by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the Communist period were closed, mainly as a result of the policies of privatisation of the post–1989 regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/download/97/93 |title=Deindustrialization and Urban Shrinkage in Romania.

===Climate===

Owing to its distance from open sea and its position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is [[temperate climate|temperate]] and [[continental climate|continental]], with four distinct seasons. The average annual temperature is {{convert|11|°C}}&amp;nbsp;in the south and {{convert|8|°C}}&amp;nbsp;in the north.&lt;ref name=climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/34.htm|title=Romania: Climate|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|access-date=10 January 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923055354/http://countrystudies.us/romania/34.htm|archive-date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer, average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rise to {{convert|28|°C}}, and temperatures over {{convert|35|°C}} are fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country.&lt;ref name="clic.npolar.no"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clic.npolar.no/disc/disc_datasets_metadata.php?s=0&amp;desc=1&amp;table=Datasets&amp;id=DISC_GCMD_GGD30&amp;tag=All&amp;Category=&amp;WCRP=&amp;Location=All&amp;stype=phrase&amp;limit=10&amp;q=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516104422/http://clic.npolar.no/disc/disc_datasets_metadata.php?s=0&amp;desc=1&amp;table=Datasets&amp;id=DISC_GCMD_GGD30&amp;tag=All&amp;Category=&amp;WCRP=&amp;Location=All&amp;stype=phrase&amp;limit=10&amp;q=|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2011|title=Permafrost Monitoring and Prediction in Southern Carpathians, Romania|publisher=CliC International Project Office (CIPO)|date=22 December 2004|access-date=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter, the average maximum temperature is below {{convert|2|°C}}.&lt;ref name="clic.npolar.no" /&gt; Precipitation is average, with over {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year only on the highest western mountains, while around Bucharest it drops to approximately {{convert|570|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=yearbook /&gt;{{rp|29}}
There are some regional differences: in western sections, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate.

The [[Constitution of Romania]] is based on [[Constitution of France|the constitution]] of France's [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] and was approved in a national referendum on 8&amp;nbsp;December 1991 and amended in October 2003 to bring it into conformity with EU legislation. The country is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. It is a [[semi-presidential]] republic where executive functions are held by both the [[Government of Romania|government]] and the [[President of Romania|president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Verheijen |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/politicalscience/9780198293866/acprof-9780198293866-chapter-10.html |title=Oxford Scholarship Online: Semi-Presidentialism in Europe |publisher=Oxfordscholarship.com |date=14 March 1990 |access-date=29 August 2011|isbn=9780191599156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister who in turn appoints the [[Romanian Cabinet|Council of Ministers]].

Since December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited [[Romania–Russia relations|relations involving]] the Russian Federation. It joined the NATO on 29&amp;nbsp;March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1&amp;nbsp;January 2007, while it joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wto.org/English/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |title=Understanding the WTO – members |publisher=WTO |access-date=29 August 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229021759/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |archive-date=29 December 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Administrative divisions of Romania}}
Romania is divided into 41 [[Counties of Romania|counties]] (''județe'', pronounced judetse) and the municipality of [[Bucharest]]. Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level. The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party.&lt;ref name="descopera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.descopera.net/romania_geografie.html |title=Geografia Romaniei |publisher=descopera.net |language=ro |access-date=7 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219224756/http://descopera.net/romania_geografie.html |archive-date=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each county is subdivided further into [[cities of Romania|cities]] and [[Communes of Romania|communes]], which have their own mayor and local council. There are a total of 320&amp;nbsp;cities and 2,861&amp;nbsp;communes in Romania.&lt;ref name=yearbook /&gt;{{rp|17}} A total of 103&amp;nbsp;of the larger cities have [[Municipalities of Romania|municipality]] status, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs. The municipality of Bucharest is a special case, as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county. It is further divided into six [[sectors of Bucharest|sectors]]&lt;ref name=yearbook /&gt;{{rp|6}} and has a prefect, a general mayor (''primar''), and a general city council.

The NUTS-3 ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]]) level divisions of the European Union reflect Romania's administrative-territorial structure and correspond to the 41&amp;nbsp;counties plus Bucharest.&lt;ref name=nuts /&gt; The cities and communes correspond to the NUTS-5 level divisions, but there are no current NUTS-4 level divisions.
