[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Jainism]], a [[soul]] travels to any one of the four states of existence after death depending on its [[karma]]s.]]
'''Reincarnation''', also known as '''rebirth''' or '''transmigration''', is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that the non-physical essence of a living [[being]] begins a new [[life]] in a different physical form or [[physical body|body]] after biological [[death]].{{Sfn|McClelland|2010|pp=24–29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} [[Resurrection]] is a similar process hypothesized by some religions, in which a soul comes back to life in the same body. In most beliefs involving reincarnation, the soul is seen as immortal and the only thing that becomes perishable is the body. Upon death, the soul becomes transmigrated into a new infant (or animal) to live again. The term transmigration means passing of soul from one body to another '''after-death'''. 

Reincarnation is a central tenet of the [[Indian religions]] (namely [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]) and some varieties of [[Paganism]], while there are many groups who do not believe in reincarnation, instead believing in an [[afterlife]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J.

Although the majority of denominations within [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

==Conceptual definitions==
The word ''reincarnation'' derives from a [[Latin]] term that literally means 'entering the flesh again'. Reincarnation refers to the belief that an aspect of every human being (or all living beings in some cultures) continues to exist after death. This aspect may be the soul or mind or consciousness or something transcendent which is reborn in an interconnected cycle of existence; the transmigration belief varies by culture, and is envisioned to be in the form of a newly born human being, or animal, or plant, or spirit, or as a being in some other non-human realm of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/reincarnation|access-date=25 June 2016|publisher=Concise.britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Keown|2013|pp=35–40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C|title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2006|isbn=978-81-208-2045-6|page=39|author-link=Christopher Chapple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative term is ''transmigration'', implying migration from one life (body) to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oxford Dictionaries|year=2016|title=Transmigration|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/transmigrate|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used by modern philosophers such as [[Kurt Gödel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Sigmund|title=Gödel Exhibition: Gödel's Century|url=http://www.goedelexhibition.at/goedel/goedel.html|access-date=6 December 2011|publisher=Goedelexhibition.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has entered the English language.

The Greek equivalent to reincarnation, ''[[metempsychosis]]'' ({{Lang-el|μετεμψύχωσις|label=none}}), derives from ''meta'' ('change') and {{Transl|el|empsykhoun}} ('to put a soul into'),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metempsychosis metempsychosis], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; a term attributed to [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Huffman (2014), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/ Pythagoras, 4.1 The Fate of the Soul—Metempsychosis] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is ''[[palingenesis]]'', 'being born again'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart of Hinduism: Reincarnation and Samsara|url=http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232238/http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm|archive-date=19 April 2011|access-date=6 December 2011|publisher=Hinduism.iskcon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebirth is a key concept found in major Indian religions, and discussed using various terms.

These religions believe that this reincarnation is cyclic and an endless [[Saṃsāra]], unless one gains spiritual insights that ends this cycle leading to liberation.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90–99}} The reincarnation concept is considered in Indian religions as a step that starts each "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence,"{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} but one that is an opportunity to seek spiritual liberation through ethical living and a variety of meditative, yogic (''marga''), or other spiritual practices.{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2010), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Volume II, Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17893-9}}, pp. 881–884&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the release from the cycle of reincarnations as the ultimate spiritual goal, and call the liberation by terms such as [[moksha]], [[nirvana]], ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan. 1985), pp. 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

Série in-8°, Fasc. 61, Édition-Diffusion de Boccard (Paris), {{ISBN|978-2868030610}}, pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain traditions have differed, since ancient times, in their assumptions and in their details on what reincarnates, how reincarnation occurs and what leads to liberation.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|pp=1–2, 108, 126–128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272–273}}

''[[Gilgul]]'', ''Gilgul neshamot'', or ''Gilgulei Ha Neshamot'' ({{Lang-he|גלגול הנשמות}}) is the concept of reincarnation in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Judaism]], found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. ''Gilgul'' means 'cycle' and ''neshamot'' is 'souls'. Kabbalistic reincarnation says that humans reincarnate only to humans unless [[YHWH]]/[[Ein Sof]]/[[God]] chooses.

==History==

===Origins===

The origins of the notion of reincarnation are obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Theosophical Society in America|title=Reincarnation: The Hope of the World|page=15|author=Irving Steiger Cooper|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the subject appears in the philosophical traditions of India. The Greek [[Pre-Socratics]] discussed reincarnation, and the Celtic [[druids]] are also reported to have taught a doctrine of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] thought the druids might have been influenced by the teachings of [[Pythagoras]]. Diodorus Siculus v.28.6; Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' i.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism===

The idea of reincarnation, [[saṃsāra]], did not exist in the early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Boyer: ''Etude sur l'origine de la doctrine du samsara.'' Journal Asiatique, (1901), Volume 9, Issue 18, S. 451–453, 459–468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yuvraj Krishan: . Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1997, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1233-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of reincarnation has roots in the [[Upanishads]] of the late [[Vedic period]] (c. 1100 – c. 500 BCE), predating the [[Buddha]] and the [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=28, 32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_29ZDAcUEwYC|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy|last=Laumakis|first=Stephen J.|date=21 February 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139469661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of the cycle of birth and death, samsara, and liberation partly derive from ascetic traditions that arose in India around the middle of the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. Olivelle, Patrick. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell. pp. 273-4. "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara – the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana – the goal of human existence....."&lt;/ref&gt; Though no direct evidence of this has been found, the tribes of the [[Ganges]] valley or the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] traditions of [[South India]] have been proposed as another early source of reincarnation beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge University Press (1996), UK {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}} p. 86 – "A third alternative is that the origin of transmigration theory lies outside of vedic or sramana traditions in the tribal religions of the Ganges valley, or even in Dravidian traditions of south India."&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Vedas do not mention the doctrine of [[Karma]] and rebirth but mention the belief in an [[afterlife]].{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}}{{sfn|Stephen J.

The texts of ancient [[Jainism]] that have survived into the modern era are post-Mahavira, likely from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, and extensively mention rebirth and karma doctrines.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= [[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 14–16, 102–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaina philosophy assumes that the soul (''[[jiva]]'' in Jainism; ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' in Hinduism) exists and is eternal, passing through cycles of transmigration and rebirth.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226-228}} After death, reincarnation into a new body is asserted to be instantaneous in early Jaina texts.&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Depending upon the accumulated karma, rebirth occurs into a higher or lower bodily form, either in heaven or hell or earthly realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristi L.

In early Buddhist traditions, ''[[Saṃsāra]]'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which the wheel of existence cycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''[[niraya]]''), [[hungry ghosts]] (''[[pretas]]''), animals (''[[Tiryakas realm|tiryak]]''), humans (''[[manushya]]''), and gods (''[[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter Buddhist traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demigods (''[[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]]'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationale====
The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an [[afterlife]] in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hastings|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3-link=Louis Herbert Gray|author3=Louis Herbert Gray|series=[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]|title=Volume 12: Suffering-Zwingli|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500005|year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618|author1-link=James Hastings}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live equally moral or immoral lives. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for people, with varying degrees of virtue or vices, to end up in heaven or hell, in "either or" and disproportionate manner irrespective of how virtuous or vicious their lives were.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P.

Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism disagree in their assumptions and theories about rebirth. Hinduism relies on its foundational assumption that 'soul, Self exists' ([[Atman (Hinduism)|''atman'']] or ''attā''), in contrast to Buddhist assumption that there is 'no soul, no Self' ([[Anattā|''anatta'']] or ''anatman'').&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|page=51|quote="(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality.

===Classical antiquity===
{{see also|Metempsychosis}}
[[Image:2161 - Taormina - Badia Vecchia - Sarcofago romano del sec. II d.C. - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 20-May-2008.jpg|thumb|A 2nd-century Roman sarcophagus shows the mythology and symbolism of the Orphic and Dionysiac Mystery schools. Orpheus plays his lyre to the left.]]
Early Greek discussion of the concept dates to the 6th century BCE. An early Greek thinker known to have considered rebirth is [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (fl. 540 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Schibli, S., Hermann, Pherekydes of Syros, p. 104, Oxford Univ. Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570–c. 495 BCE&lt;ref&gt;"The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BCE, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', p. 173. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;), its first famous exponent, instituted societies for its diffusion. Some authorities believe that Pythagoras was Pherecydes' pupil, others that Pythagoras took up the idea of reincarnation from the doctrine of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], a [[Thrace|Thracian]] religion, or brought the teaching from India.

[[Plato]] (428/427–348/347 BCE) presented accounts of reincarnation in his works, particularly the ''[[Myth of Er]]'', where Plato makes Socrates tell how Er, the son of [[Arminius|Armenius]], miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world. There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues, in the [[Chariot allegory]] of the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', in the ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Laws]]''. The soul, once separated from the body, spends an indeterminate amount of time in "formland" (see The [[Allegory of the Cave]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'') and then assumes another body.

In ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato has his teacher [[Socrates]], prior to his death, state: "I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead." However, [[Xenophon]] does not mention Socrates as believing in reincarnation, and Plato may have systematised Socrates' thought with concepts he took directly from Pythagoreanism or Orphism.

====Mystery cults====
The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]], which taught reincarnation, about the 6th century BC, organized itself into [[mystery schools]] at [[Eleusis]] and elsewhere, and produced a copious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Linforth, Ivan M. (1941) ''The Arts of Orpheus'' Arno Press, New York, {{OCLC|514515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (1948) ''A Study of the doctrine of metempsychosis in Greece, from Pythagoras to Plato'' (Long's 1942 Ph.D. dissertation) Princeton, New Jersey, {{OCLC|1472399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (16 February 1948) "Plato's Doctrine of Metempsychosis and Its Source" ''The Classical Weekly'' 41(10): pp. 149—155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]], its legendary founder, is said to have taught that the immortal soul aspires to freedom while the body holds it prisoner. The wheel of birth revolves, the soul alternates between freedom and captivity round the wide circle of necessity. Orpheus proclaimed the need of the grace of the gods, [[Dionysus]] in particular, and of self-purification until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live forever. An association between [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean philosophy]] and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity. 

====Late authors====
In later Greek literature the doctrine is mentioned in a fragment of [[Menander]]&lt;ref&gt;Menander, ''The Inspired Woman''&lt;/ref&gt; and satirized by [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Gallus'', 18 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature it is found as early as [[Ennius]],&lt;ref&gt;Poesch, Jessie (1962) "Ennius and Basinio of Parma" ''[[Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes]]'' 25(1/2):116–18. p. 117 n15.&lt;/ref&gt; who, in a lost passage of his ''Annals'', told how he had seen [[Homer]] in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. [[Persius]] in his satires (vi. 9) laughs at this, it is referred to also by [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, (i. 124)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'', II. i. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virgil]] works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''The Aeneid'', vv. 724 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It persists down to the late classic thinkers, [[Plotinus]] and the other [[Neoplatonist]]s. In the [[Hermetica]], a Graeco-Egyptian series of writings on cosmology and spirituality attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]]/[[Thoth]], the doctrine of reincarnation is central.

===Celtic paganism===
In the 1st century BCE [[Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor]] wrote:

{{bquote|The Pythagorean doctrine prevails among the [[Gauls]]' teaching that the souls of men are immortal, and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body.}}

[[Julius Caesar]] recorded that the [[druids]] of Gaul, Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, "De Bello Gallico", VI&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another... the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.}}

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] believed the Gauls had been taught the doctrine of reincarnation by a slave of [[Pythagoras]] named [[Zalmoxis]]. Conversely, [[Clement of Alexandria]] believed Pythagoras himself had learned it from the Celts and not the opposite, claiming he had been taught by [[Galatians (people)|Galatian]] Gauls, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] priests and [[Zoroastrians]].&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Melrose|title=The Druids and King Arthur: A New View of Early Britain|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-07-864600-5-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic paganism===
{{Main|Rebirth in Germanic paganism}}
Surviving texts indicate that there was a belief in [[rebirth in Germanic paganism]]. Examples include figures from [[eddic poetry]] and [[saga]]s, potentially by way of a process of naming and/or through the family line. Scholars have discussed the implications of these attestations and proposed theories regarding belief in reincarnation among the [[Germanic peoples]] prior to [[Christianization]] and potentially to some extent in [[folk belief]] thereafter.

===Judaism===
The belief in reincarnation developed among Jewish mystics in the Medieval World, among whom differing explanations were given of the afterlife, although with a universal belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs &amp; Rituals'', By George Robinson, Simon and Schuster 2008, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Today, reincarnation is an [[esoteric]] belief within many streams of modern Judaism. [[Kabbalah]] teaches a belief in ''[[gilgul]]'', transmigration of souls, and hence the belief in reincarnation is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, and is also held as an esoteric belief within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]. In [[Judaism]], the [[Zohar]], first published in the 13th century, discusses reincarnation at length, especially in the [[Torah]] portion "Balak." The most comprehensive [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] work on reincarnation, ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity", p. 104, by B. Alan Wallace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism", p. 190, by J. H. Chajes&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Chaim Vital]], based on the teachings of his mentor, the 16th century kabbalist [[Isaac Luria]], who was said to know the past lives of each person through his [[Ruach HaKodesh|semi-prophetic]] abilities. The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Elijah of Vilna, known as the [[Vilna Gaon]], authored a commentary on the biblical [[Book of Jonah]] as an allegory of reincarnation.

The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may "wander among nations" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a "lost" Jewish ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation'', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an extensive literature of Jewish folk and traditional stories that refer to reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Yonasson Gershom (1999), ''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation''. Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson. {{ISBN|0765760835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In [[Hellenistic philosophy|Greco-Roman thought]], the concept of metempsychosis disappeared with the rise of [[Early Christianity]], reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of [[salvation]] of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early [[Church Fathers]], especially [[Origen]], still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it.&lt;ref&gt;The book ''Reincarnation in Christianity'', by the [[theosophist]] [[Geddes MacGregor]] (1978) asserted that Origen believed in reincarnation.  MacGregor is convinced that Origen believed in and taught about reincarnation but that his texts written about the subject have been destroyed. He admits that there is no extant proof for that position. The allegation was also repeated by [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her book ''Out On a Limb''.
Origen does discuss the concept of transmigration (''metensomatosis'') from Greek philosophy, but it is repeatedly stated that this concept is not a part of the Christian teaching or scripture in his Comment on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (which survives only in a 6th-century Latin translatio): "In this place [when Jesus said Elijah was come and referred to John the Baptist] it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I fall into the doctrine of [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]], which is foreign to the Church of God, and not handed down by the apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the scriptures" (13:1:46–53, see [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII|Commentary on Matthew, Book XIII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnosticism====
Several Christian [[Gnostic]] sects professed reincarnation. The [[Sethians]] and followers of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] believed in it.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is documented in R.E. Slater's book ''Paradise Reconsidered.''&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Bardaisan]] of [[Mesopotamia]], a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon [[Babylon|Chaldean]] [[astrology]], to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including a sort of metempsychosis. Another such teacher was [[Basilides]] (132–? CE/AD), known to us through the criticisms of [[Irenaeus]] and the work of [[Clement of Alexandria]] (see also [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] and [[Buddhism and Gnosticism]]).

In the third Christian century [[Manichaeism]] spread both east and west from [[Babylonia]], then within the [[Sassanid Empire]], where its founder [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] lived about 216–276. Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD. Noting Mani's early travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] and other Buddhist influences in Manichaeism, [[Richard Foltz]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; attributes Mani's teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence. However the inter-relation of Manicheanism, Orphism, Gnosticism and neo-Platonism is far from clear.

===Taoism===
[[Taoist]] documents from as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] claimed that [[Lao Tzu]] appeared on earth as different persons in different times beginning in the legendary era of [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. The (ca. 3rd century BC) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Chuang Tzu]]'' states: "Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting-point. Existence without limitation is Space. Continuity without a starting point is Time. There is birth, there is death, there is issuing forth, there is entering in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/chuangtzmysticm00chuagoog|title=Chuang Tzŭ: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer (translated by Herbert Allen Giles)|publisher= Bernard Quaritch|year= 1889|page= [https://archive.org/details/chuangtzmysticm00chuagoog/page/n338 304]|author1=Zhuangzi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=April 2019}}

===European Middle Ages===
Around the 11–12th century in Europe, several reincarnationist movements were persecuted as heresies, through the establishment of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the Latin west. These included the [[Cathar]], Paterene or Albigensian church of western Europe, the [[Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 February 1911 |access-date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomils]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Medieval Manichee: A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy'', 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-28926-2}}, Cambridge University Press, ''The Bogomils'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=d1LGB7u5iD0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mediaeval+manichee&amp;cd=1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sects such as the Bogomils and the Cathars, who professed reincarnation and other gnostic beliefs, were referred to as "Manichaean", and are today sometimes described by scholars as "Neo-Manichaean".&lt;ref&gt;For example Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no known Manichaean mythology or terminology in the writings of these groups there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups truly were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |access-date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
While reincarnation has been a matter of faith in some communities from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato does when he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible,&lt;ref&gt;"the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number." Republic X, 611. The Republic of Plato By Plato, Benjamin Jowett Edition: 3 Published by Clarendon press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to his friend [[George Whatley]] written 23 May 1785: {{cite journal|jstor = 25057231|title = Death Effects: Revisiting the Conceit of Franklin's "Memoir"|journal = Early American Literature|volume = 36|issue = 2|pages = 201–234|last1 = Kennedy|first1 = Jennifer T.|year = 2001|doi = 10.1353/eal.2001.0016|s2cid = 161799223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such convictions, as in Socrates' case, arise from a more general personal faith, at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the ''[[Myth of Er]]''.

During the [[Renaissance]] translations of Plato, the [[Hermetica]] and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation. [[Marsilio Ficino]]&lt;ref&gt;Marsilio Ficino, ''Platonic Theology'', 17.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plato's references to reincarnation were intended allegorically, Shakespeare alluded to the doctrine of reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;"Again, Rosalind in "As You Like It" (Act III., Scene 2), says: ''I was never so be-rhimed that I can remember since Pythagoras's time, when I was an Irish rat"'' — alluding to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls." William H. Grattan Flood, quoted at [http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishMusic/XVII-2.php Libraryireland.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Giordano Bruno]] was burned at the stake by authorities after being found guilty of heresy by the [[Roman Inquisition]] for his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Boulting, 1914. pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt; But the Greek philosophical works remained available and, particularly in north Europe, were discussed by groups such as the [[Cambridge Platonists]].

===19th to 20th centuries===

By the 19th century the philosophers [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A: "Parerga und Paralipomena" (Eduard Grisebach edition), On Religion, Section 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche and the Doctrine of Metempsychosis, in J. Urpeth &amp; J. Lippitt, ''Nietzsche and the Divine'',  Manchester: Clinamen, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; could access the Indian scriptures for discussion of the doctrine of reincarnation, which recommended itself to the [[American Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and was adapted by [[Francis Bowen]] into ''Christian Metempsychosis''.&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |title=Shirleymaclaine.com |publisher=Shirleymaclaine.com |access-date=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106160539/http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |archive-date=6 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, interest in reincarnation had been introduced into the nascent discipline of [[psychology]], largely due to the influence of [[William James]], who raised aspects of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[comparative religion]], the psychology of religious experience and the nature of empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hammerman, Lisa Lenard, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reincarnation'', Penguin, p.34. For relevant works by James, see; William James, ''Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine (the Ingersoll Lecture, 1897)'', ''The Will to Believe, Human Immortality'' (1956) Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-20291-7}}, ''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature'' (1902), {{ISBN|0-14-039034-0}}, ''Essays in Radical Empiricism'' (1912) Dover Publications 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was influential in the founding of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in [[New York City]] in 1885, three years after the British [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was inaugurated in London,&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; leading to systematic, critical investigation of paranormal phenomena.  Famous World War II American General George Patton was a strong believer in reincarnation, believing, among other things, he was a reincarnation of the Carthaginian General Hannibal.

At this time popular awareness of the idea of reincarnation was boosted by the [[Theosophical Society]]'s dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|The Golden Dawn]]. Notable personalities like [[Annie Besant]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Dion Fortune]] made the subject almost as [[Reincarnation in popular culture|familiar an element of the popular culture]] of the west as of the east. By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Richmal Crompton, ''More William'', George Newnes, London, 1924, XIII. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17125/17125-h/17125-h.htm William and the Ancient Souls]; "The memory usually came in a flash. For instance, you might remember in a flash when you were looking at a box of matches that you had been Guy Fawkes."&lt;/ref&gt; Humorist [[Don Marquis]] created a fictional cat named Mehitabel who claimed to be a reincarnation of Queen Cleopatra.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, "Archy and Mehitabel" (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Théodore Flournoy]] was among the first to study a claim of past-life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium [[Hélène Smith]], published in 1900, in which he defined the possibility of [[cryptomnesia]] in such accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, [http://www.psychanalyse-paris.com/-Des-Indes-a-la-planete-Mars-.html Des Indes à la planète Mars], Étude sur un cas de somnambulisme avec glossolalie, Éditions Alcan et Eggimann, Paris et Genève, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carl Gustav Jung]], like Flournoy based in Switzerland, also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: "This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own...."&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"/&gt; [[Hypnosis]], used in [[psychoanalysis]] for retrieving forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.

According to various Buddhist scriptures, [[Gautama Buddha]] believed in the existence of an afterlife in another world and in reincarnation,

Buddhist traditions also vary in their mechanistic details on rebirth.

Within Japanese [[Zen]], reincarnation is accepted by some, but rejected by others. A distinction can be drawn between 'folk Zen', as in the Zen practiced by devotional lay people, and 'philosophical Zen'. Folk Zen generally accepts the various supernatural elements of Buddhism such as rebirth. Philosophical Zen, however, places more emphasis on the present moment.{{Sfn|McClelland|2010|p=281}}&lt;ref name=warner&gt;{{citation|last=Warner|first=Brad|title=Hardcore Zen|isbn= 9780861719891|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2005|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools conclude that [[karma]] continues to exist and adhere to the person until it works out its consequences. For the [[Sautrantika]] school, each act "perfumes" the individual or "plants a seed" that later germinates. Tibetan Buddhism stresses the state of mind at the time of death. To die with a peaceful mind will stimulate a virtuous seed and a fortunate rebirth; a disturbed mind will stimulate a non-virtuous seed and an unfortunate rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Transform Your Life'': A Blissful Journey, p. 52), [[Tharpa Publications]] (2001, US ed. 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In the major Christian denominations, the concept of reincarnation is not present and it is nowhere explicitly referred to in the Bible. However, the impossibility of a second earthly death is stated by {{bibleref|1Peter|3:18-20|NKJV}}, where it affirms that Jesus Christ God died once forever ([[Latin]]: ''[[wikt:en:semel|semel]]'', 'a single time')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clementine Vulgate, First Letter of Peter, chapter 3, verse 18|url=https://biblehub.com/vul/1_peter/3.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190803185712/https://biblehub.com/vul/1_peter/3.htm|archive-date=3 August 2019|access-date=5 August 2019|website=biblehub.com|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the sins of all the human kind.

In a survey by the [[Pew Forum]] in 2009, 22% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/Many-Americans-Mix-Multiple-Faiths.aspx |title=Pewforum.org |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=9 December 2009 |access-date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1981 survey 31% of regular churchgoing European Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirituale-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425113340/http://spiritual-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 April 2001 |title=Spiritual-wholeness.org |publisher=Spiritual-wholeness.org |access-date=6 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian theologians interpret certain Biblical passages as referring to reincarnation. These passages include the questioning of Jesus as to whether he is Elijah, John the Baptist, Jeremiah, or another prophet ([[Matthew 16]]:13–15 and [[John 1]]:21–22) and, less clearly (while Elijah was said not to have died, but to have been taken up to heaven), John the Baptist being asked if he is not Elijah (John 1:25).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Frieling, ''Christianity and Reincarnation'', Floris Books 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Albrecht, ''Reincarnation, a Christian Appraisal'', InterVarsity Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn A. De Silva, ''Reincarnation in Buddhist and Christian Thought'', Christian Literature Society of Ceylon, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geddes MacGregor]], an Episcopalian priest and professor of philosophy, has made a case for the compatibility of Christian doctrine and reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cranston |first=Sylvia |title=Reincarnation in Christianity: A New Vision of the Role of Rebirth in Christian Thought (Quest Books) (9780835605014): Geddes MacGregor: Books |isbn=0835605019|date=9 March 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early====
There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;"The Big Book of Reincarnation", by Roy Stemman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; that [[Origen]], a [[Church father]] in early Christian times, taught reincarnation in his lifetime but that when his works were translated into Latin these references were concealed. One of the epistles written by [[St. Jerome]], "To Avitus" (Letter 124; Ad Avitum. Epistula CXXIV),&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/text.php?tabelle=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2&amp;rumpfid=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2,%20Epistolae,%20124,%20%20%20%20p0&amp;corpus=2&amp;lang=0&amp;current_title=EPISTOLA%20CXXIV.%20AD%20AVITUM.%20Quid%20cavendum%20in%20Libris%20%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%E1%BD%B6%20%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD.&amp;links=&amp;inframe=1|title=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2, Epistolae, 124, p0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that Origen's ''[[On the First Principles]]'' (Latin: ''De Principiis''; Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν)&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Second Edition). New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt; was mistranscribed:

{{Quote| About ten years ago that saintly man [[Saint Pammachius|Pammachius]] sent me a copy of a certain person's [ [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"/&gt; ] rendering, or rather misrendering, of Origen's ''First Principles''; with a request that in a Latin version I should give the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer's words for good or for evil without bias in either direction. When I did as he wished and sent him the book, he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the souls of many.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001124.htm|title=Church Fathers: Letter 124 (Jerome)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the impression that Origen was a heretic like [[Arius]], St. Jerome criticizes ideas described in ''On the First Principles''. Further in "To Avitus" (Letter 124), St. Jerome writes about "convincing proof" that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book:

{{Quote|The following passage is a convincing proof that he holds the transmigration of the souls and annihilation of bodies. 'If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.'&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The original text of ''On First Principles'' has almost completely disappeared. It remains extant as ''De Principiis'' in fragments faithfully translated into Latin by St. Jerome and in "the not very reliable Latin translation of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]."&lt;ref name=Cross /&gt;

Belief in reincarnation was rejected by [[Augustine of Hippo]] in [[The City of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Agustine of Hippo | translator = [[Marcus Dods (theologian born 1834)|Marcus Dods]] | url = https://archive.org/details/cityofgodtransla01auguuoft | title = The city of God.

===Druze===
{{Druze|collapsed=1}}
{{See also|Druze#Beliefs}}
Reincarnation is a paramount tenet in the [[Druze]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; There is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. Therefore, reincarnations occur instantly at one's death. While in the Hindu and Buddhist belief system a soul can be transmitted to any living creature, in the Druze belief system this is not possible and a human soul will only transfer to a human body. Furthermore, souls cannot be divided into different or separate parts and the number of souls existing is finite.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) "The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel" ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry,'' pp. 29–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Few Druzes are able to recall their past but, if they are able to they are called a ''Nateq''. Typically souls who have died violent deaths in their previous incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James |title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2002 |isbn=1615927387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] states:

Just as in the body childhood, adulthood and old age happen to an embodied being. So also he (the embodied being) acquires another body. The wise one is not deluded about this. (2:13){{Sfn|Chapple|2010|p=98}}

As, after casting away worn out garments, a man later takes new ones. So after casting away worn out bodies, the embodied Self encounters other new ones. (2:22){{Sfn|Chapple|2010|p=107}}

There are internal differences within Hindu traditions on reincarnation and the state of [[moksha]]. For example, the dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert that human soul and Brahman are different, loving devotion to Brahman (god Vishnu in Madhvacharya's theology) is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of God which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''[[videhamukti]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

From the teachings of Modern Sufi ''[[Sheikh]]'' M.R. Bawa Muhaiyadeen (Guru Bawa); a person's state continuously changes during his one lifetime (angry/violent at once and being gentle/nice in another). So when a person's state changes, his previous state dies. Even though it dies, the earlier state (of anger) will be reborn in another minute. According to Guru Bawa; the changing of a person's state is described as “rebirth” or reincarnation, this should not be confused with the physical death &amp; rebirth. Although some scholars wrongly misquote that Guru Bawa accepts the common belief of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''To Die Before Death: The Sufi Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]], the reincarnation doctrine, along with its theories of ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma, are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on these topics from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Reincarnation in contemporary Jainism traditions is the belief that the worldly life is characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226–228}}&lt;ref name="dundasp14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'') and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 226–230&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Uttarâdhyayana Sûtra|Uttarādhyayana Sūtra]]'' 3.3–4 states: "The ''jīva'' or the soul is sometimes born in [[devaloka|the world of gods]], sometimes in [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. Sometimes it acquires the body of a [[asura|demon]]; all this happens on account of its karma. This ''jīva'' sometimes takes birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant."&lt;ref name=krishan43&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997): p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The text further states (32.7): "Karma is the root of birth and death. The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence."&lt;ref name=krishan43 /&gt;

Actions and emotions in the current lifetime affect future incarnations depending on the nature of the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that their future births will allow them to experience and manifest their virtues and good feelings unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, they may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; As a natural consequence, they will attract karma which will ensure that they are reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable their soul to experience the cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64/&gt;

There is no retribution, judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Aidan (2006) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts postulate four ''gatis'', that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four ''gatis'' are: ''[[Deva (Jainism)|deva]]'' (demigods), ''[[Manusya-gati|manuṣya]]'' (humans), ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|nāraki]]'' (hell beings), and ''tiryañca'' (animals, plants, and microorganisms).&lt;ref name=Jaini108&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The four ''gatis'' have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered [[Jain cosmology#Jain geography|Jain universe]]: ''deva'' occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; ''manuṣya'' and ''tiryañca'' occupy the middle levels; and ''nāraki'' occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.&lt;ref name=Jaini108/&gt;

Single-sensed souls, however, called ''[[nigoda]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. ''Nigodas'' are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of ''nigodas'' can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub-sub-categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (2000) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, ''[[Vyakhyaprajnapti|Bhagvati sūtra]]'' 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood lead to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows lead to rebirth in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Each soul is thus responsible for its own predicament, as well as its own salvation. Accumulated karma represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires, attachments and aspirations of a soul.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28 /&gt; Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karma that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the required fruits. In certain philosophies, heavens and hells are often viewed as places for eternal salvation or eternal damnation for good and bad deeds. But according to Jainism, such places, including the earth are simply the places which allow the soul to experience its unfulfilled karma.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 65–66, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Gilgul}}
{{Kabbalah||collapsed=1}}
Jewish mystical texts (the [[Kabbalah]]), from their classic Medieval canon onward, teach a belief in ''[[Gilgul Neshamot]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for [[metempsychosis]]; literally 'soul cycle'; plural ''gilgulim''). The [[Zohar]] and the [[Sefer HaBahir]] specifically discuss reincarnation. It is a common belief in contemporary [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, though understood in light of a more [[Deveikut|innate]] psychological mysticism. Kabbalah also teaches that "The soul of Moses is reincarnated in every generation."&lt;ref&gt;Tikunei Zohar, Tikkun 69, 112a and 114a. Literally, "There is an extension of Moses in every generation and to each and every righteous man."&lt;/ref&gt; Other, Non-Hasidic, [[Orthodox Jewish]] groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation, do acknowledge it as a valid teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl-old/kc/48943926.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularization entered modern secular [[Yiddish literature]] and folk motif.

The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal [[Safed]] replaced scholastic [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalism]] as mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. References to ''gilgul'' in former Kabbalah became systematized as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation. [[Isaac Luria]] (the Ari) brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation, for the first time, and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by [[Haim Vital]] in his [[Shaar HaGilgulim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim, The Gate of Reincarnations'', Chaim Vital&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilgul'' is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of [[Ibbur]] ('pregnancy'), the attachment of a second soul to an individual for (or by) good means, and [[Dybuk]] ('possession'), the attachment of a spirit, demon, etc. to an individual for (or by) "bad" means.

In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an expression of Divine compassion, the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation. ''Gilgul'' is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on [[Tohu and Tikkun|rectification]] of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification." A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most basic component of the soul, the [[nefesh]], must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the [[613 Mitzvot|613 Mosaic commandments]] that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. Non-Jewish observance of the [[7 Laws of Noah]] assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose.

Among the many rabbis who accepted reincarnation are [[Nahmanides]] (the Ramban) and Rabbenu [[Bahya ben Asher]], [[Levi ibn Habib]] (the Ralbah), [[Shelomoh Alkabez]], [[Moses Cordovero]], [[Moses Chaim Luzzatto]]; early Hasidic masters such as the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] and [[Nachman of Breslov]], as well as virtually all later Hasidic masters;  contemporary Hasidic teachers such as DovBer Pinson, [[Moshe Weinberger]] and [[Joel Landau (rabbi)|Joel Landau]]; and key Mitnagdic leaders, such as the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Chaim Volozhin]] and their school, as well as Rabbi [[Shalom Sharabi]] (known at the RaShaSH), the [[Ben Ish Chai]] of Baghdad, and the [[Baba Sali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limmudbayarea2016.sched.com/event/7YDY/judaism-and-reincarnation|title=Limmud Bay Area 2016: Judaism and Reincarnation|website=limmudbayarea2016.sched.com|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis who have rejected the idea include [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Leon de Modena]], [[Solomon ben Aderet]], [[Maimonides]] and [[Asher ben Jehiel]]. Among the [[Geonim]], [[Hai Gaon]] argued in favour of ''gilgulim''.

The following is a story of human-to-human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud, a Winnebago ([[Ho-Chunk]] tribe) [[Shamanism|shaman]] referred to as T. C. in the narrative. Here T. C. talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime. He describes his time between lives, when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers, including the ability to heal the sick.

T. C.'s Account of his two reincarnations:
{{bquote|I ''(my ghost)'' was taken to the place where the sun sets ''(the west)''. ... While at that place, I thought I would come back to earth again, and the old man with whom I was staying said to me, “My son, did you not speak about wanting to go to the earth again?” I had, as a matter of fact, only thought of it, yet he knew what I wanted. Then he said to me, “You can go, but you must ask the chief first.” Then I went and told the chief of the village of my desire, and he said to me, “You may go and obtain your revenge upon the people who killed your relatives and you.” Then I was brought down to earth. ... There I lived until I died of old age. ... As I was lying [in my grave], someone said to me, “Come, let us go away.” So then we went toward the setting of the sun.

The doctrines of Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body to another in endless cycles of [[Saṃsāra]], until liberation from the death and rebirth cycle. Each birth begins with karma (''[[Karma#Sikhism|karam]]''), and these actions leave a karmic signature (''karni'') on one's soul which influences future rebirths, but it is [[God in Sikhism|God]] whose grace that liberates from the death and rebirth cycle.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The way out of the reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote oneself to God and constantly remember God's name.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair |title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ  |year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7 |pages=145–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precepts of Sikhism encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (liberation from the death and rebirth cycle).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

===New religious and spiritual movements===
{{Paranormal|state=collapsed}}

====Spiritism====
[[File:Tombe Allan Kardec.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], founder of spiritism. The inscription says in French "To be born, die, again be reborn, and so progress unceasingly, such is the law".]]
[[Spiritism]], a Christian philosophy codified in the 19th century by the French educator [[Allan Kardec]], teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. According to this doctrine, free will and cause and effect are the corollaries of reincarnation, and reincarnation provides a mechanism for man's spiritual evolution in successive lives.&lt;ref name="Hess2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Hess|title=Spirits and Scientists: Ideology, Spiritism and Brazilian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGxsfV-lTtEC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-04080-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
The [[Theosophical Society]] draws much of its inspiration from India. In the Theosophical world-view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul, the part of a person which belongs to the formless non-material and timeless worlds, unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself. It descends from sublime, free, spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world. Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of reality, in death, a purification and assimilation of the past life. Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature, ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation, every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self-knowledge and self-expression. However it may attract old mental, emotional, and energetic ''karma'' patterns to form the new personality.

====Anthroposophy====
[[Anthroposophy]] describes reincarnation from the point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). [[Rudolf Steiner]] described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Reincarnation and Karma'' by Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of successive lives of various individualities.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Karmic Relationships'', volumes 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Similarly, other famous people’s life stories are not primarily the result of genes, upbringing or biographical vicissitudes. Steiner relates that a large estate in north-eastern France was held during the early Middle Ages by a martial feudal lord. During a military campaign, this estate was captured by a rival. The previous owner had no means of retaliating, and was forced to see his property lost to an enemy. He was filled with a smoldering resentment towards the propertied classes, not only for the remainder of his life in the Middle Ages, but also in a much later incarnation—as Karl Marx. His rival was reborn as Friedrich Engels.&lt;ref name="Hammer2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Olav|last=Hammer|title=Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZYsPQgBNioC&amp;pg=PA495|date=1 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-13638-X|page=495}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Olav Hammer]]|Coda.

====Modern astrology====
Inspired by [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s major works, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', [[astrology|astrologers]] in the early twentieth-century integrated the concepts of [[karma]] and reincarnation into the practice of [[Western astrology]]. Notable astrologers who advanced this development included [[Alan Leo]], Charles E. O. Carter, [[Marc Edmund Jones]], and [[Dane Rudhyar]]. A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology's deep roots in [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. In the case of Rudhyar, this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[depth psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Woods. "The Theosophical Heritage in Modern Astrology." ''The Mountain Astrologer.'' Aug/Sept 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic integration of astrology, reincarnation and depth psychology has continued into the modern era with the work of astrologers [[Steven Forrest (astrologer)|Steven Forrest]] and Jeffrey Wolf Green.  Their respective schools of Evolutionary Astrology are based on "an acceptance of the fact that human beings incarnate in a succession of lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forrestastrology.com/about-us/about-evolutionary-astrology|title=About Evolutionary Astrology|author=Steven Forrest and Jeffrey Wolf Green|access-date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientology====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Whole Track]] --&gt;
{{See also|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

Past reincarnation, usually termed '''past lives''', is a key part of the principles and practices of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually a ''[[thetan]]'', an immortal spiritual entity, that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past-life experiences. Scientology [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is intended to free the person of these past-life traumas and recover past-life memory, leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness.

This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order, [[Sea Org]], whose motto is "''Revenimus''" ('We Come Back'), and whose members sign a "[[Billion year contract|billion-year contract]]" as a sign of commitment to that ideal. [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of Scientology, does not use the word "reincarnation" to describe its beliefs, noting that: "The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning. The word has come to mean 'to be born again in different life forms' whereas its actual definition is 'to be born again into the flesh of another body.' Scientology ascribes to this latter, original definition of reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |title=Scientology Church &amp; Religion – What is Scientology? |work=Scientology |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613231607/http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |archive-date=13 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]''. In 1968 he wrote ''[[Mission into Time]]'', a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago.

====Meher Baba====
The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego-mind ceases to reincarnate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967), [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses''], Volume III, Sufism Reoriented, 1967, {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====
[[Wicca]] is a [[neo-pagan]] religion focused on nature, guided by the philosophy of [[Wiccan Rede]] that advocates the tenets "Harm None, Do As Ye Will". Wiccans believe in a form of karmic return where one's deeds are returned, either in the current life or in another life, threefold or multiple times in order to teach one lessons (the [[Threefold law|Threefold Law]]). Reincarnation is therefore an accepted part of the Wiccan faith.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft, Raven Grimassi&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} Wiccans also believe that death and afterlife are important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Western world==
Before the late nineteenth century, reincarnation was a relatively rare theme in the West. In ancient Greece, the [[Orphic Mysteries]] and [[Pythagoreans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|url=https://archive.org/details/pythagoraspythag00kahn|url-access=limited|author=Charles H.

[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] believed that we leave the physical world once, but then go through several lives in the spiritual world—a kind of hybrid of Christian tradition and the popular view of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://swedenborg.com/recap-do-we-reincarnate/ |title = Swedenborg and Life Recap: Do We Reincarnate? 3/6/2017 |publisher=Swedenborg Foundation |access-date=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, many people in the West have developed an interest in and acceptance of reincarnation.&lt;ref name="hi.is"/&gt; Many new religious movements include reincarnation among their beliefs, e.g. modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], [[Spiritism]], Astara,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/astara/ |title=Astara}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dianetics]], and [[Scientology]]. Many [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies also include reincarnation, e.g. [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Gnostic]] and [[Esoteric Christianity]] such as the works of [[Martinus Thomsen]].

[[File:Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg|thumb|The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated his belief that it would be difficult for science to disprove reincarnation.]]
[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptic]] [[Carl Sagan]] asked the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] what he would do if a fundamental tenet of his religion (reincarnation) were definitively disproved by science. The Dalai Lama answered, "If science can disprove reincarnation, Tibetan Buddhism would abandon reincarnation…but it's going to be mighty hard to disprove reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;"The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science", by Paul David Numrich, p. 13, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|9783525569870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan considered claims of memories of past lives to be worthy of research, although he considered reincarnation to be an unlikely explanation for these.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/after-the-afterlife-debate/ After the afterlife debate], referencing Sagan's book ''The Demon Haunted World''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Stevenson]] reported that belief in reincarnation is held (with variations in details) by adherents of almost all major religions except [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of persons in western countries who may be nominal Christians also believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;Jane Henry (2005).

According to Dr. [[Brian Weiss]], in 1980 one of his patients, "Catherine", began discussing past-life experiences under [[hypnosis]]. Weiss did not believe in reincarnation at the time but, after confirming elements of Catherine's stories through public records, came to be convinced of the survival of an element of the human personality after death.&lt;ref name=rl1xxx&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/seen/breakfast/20020805break0805p1.asp Breakfast with Brian Weiss], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 5 August 2002, Accessed 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Weiss claims he has regressed more than 4,000 patients since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein-Moser, Edie.

[[Neale Donald Walsch]], an American author of the series [[Conversations with God]] who says his books are not channelled, but rather that they are inspired by God and that they can help a person relate to God from a modern perspective claims that he has reincarnated more than 600 times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-3-of-3/ Being at One: Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel (Part 3 of 3, paragraphs 18–19)]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that surveys have found about one fifth to one quarter of Europeans have some level of belief in reincarnation, with similar results found in the USA. In the interviewed group, the belief in the existence of this phenomenon appeared independent of their age, or the type of religion that these people belonged to, with most being Christians. The beliefs of this group also did not appear to contain any more than usual of "new age" ideas (broadly defined) and the authors interpreted their ideas on reincarnation as "one way of tackling issues of suffering", but noted that this seemed to have little effect on their private lives.

Waterhouse also published a detailed discussion of beliefs expressed in the interviews.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1999&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that although most people "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" and were unclear on the details of their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and [[near-death experience]]s had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing that most of the people in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there "must be something in it" if other people were having such experiences.

===Claims of remembering past life===
Over a period of 40 years, psychiatrist [[Ian Stevenson]], from the [[University of Virginia]], conducted more than 2,500 [[case study|case studies]] of young children who claimed to remember past lives. He published twelve books, including ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]'', [[Reincarnation and Biology|Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects]] (a two-part monograph), and ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]''. In his cases he documented the child's statements and testimony from family members and others, often along with correlates to a [[deceased]] person who in some ways seemed to match the child's memory. Stevenson also investigated cases in which [[birthmark]]s and [[birth defects]] seemed to match wounds and scars on the deceased. Sometimes included in his documentation were [[medical records]] like [[autopsy]] photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoret, Remi. [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177497 Book Review: European Cases of the Reincarnation Type] ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting controversy and [[skepticism]], Stevenson also searched for disconfirming evidence and alternative explanations for the reports, but, as the ''Washington Post'' reported, in scores of cases he concluded that no normal explanation sufficed.&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shroder|first=T|date=11 February 2007|title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other academic researchers who have undertaken similar pursuits include [[Jim B. Tucker]], [[Antonia Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mills|url=http://jamesgmatlock.net/resources/researchers/mills/|work=Signs of Reincarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satwant Pasricha]], [[Godwin Samararatne]], and [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], but Stevenson's publications remain the most well known. Stevenson's work in this regard was impressive enough to [[Carl Sagan]] that he referred to what were apparently Stevenson's investigations in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' as an example of carefully collected empirical data, and though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories, he wrote that the phenomenon of alleged past-life memories should be further researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Jim B. |editor1-last=Presti |editor1-first=David E. |title=Mind Beyond Brain: Buddhism, Science, and the Paranormal |date=2018 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-54839-7 |chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Mind_Beyond_Brain/h2NbDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PT84 |chapter=Reports of Past-life Memories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sagan, Carl|title=Demon Haunted World|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-394-53512-8|pages=[https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Demon_haunted_World/ulqPDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA300 300]-[https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Demon_haunted_World/ulqPDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA302 302]|author-link=Carl Sagan |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Demon_haunted_World/ulqPDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA300}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] cited Stevenson's works in his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'' as part of a body of data that seems to attest to the reality of psychic phenomena, but that only relies on subjective personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|url=https://archive.org/details/endoffaithreligi00harr|title=The End of Faith|date=17 September 2005|publisher=W.

===Skepticism===

Critics of Stevenson's work include [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], who criticized the accounts of reincarnation as being purely [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and [[Cherry picking|cherry-picked]].&lt;ref name="skepticreport.com"&gt;Rockley, Richard. (2002). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090807184113/http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=482 "Book Review: Children who Remember Previous Lives"]. SkepticReport. Retrieved 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards says such stories are attributable to [[selective thinking]], [[suggestion]], and [[false memory syndrome|false memories]] that can result from the family's or researcher's belief systems and thus cannot be counted as [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Keith Augustine wrote in critique that the fact that "the vast majority of Stevenson's cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/immortality.html|title=The Case Against Immortality|publisher=Infidels.org|access-date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] pointed out that a large number of Stevenson's cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a [[Caste system in India|higher caste]]. In these societies, claims of reincarnation are sometimes used as schemes to obtain money from the richer families of alleged former incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time: Reincarnation Investigated''. Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson later published a book of cases from a cultural area where belief in reincarnation is not mainstream, ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]''. Even still, [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] asserted that all the past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists are understandable in terms of known psychological factors including a mixture of [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards also objected that reincarnation invokes assumptions that are inconsistent with modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 202–203. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}} "Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect."

*[[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the vast majority of people do not remember previous lives and there is no empirically documented mechanism known that allows personality to survive death and travel to another body, positing the existence of reincarnation is subject to the principle that "[[extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence]]". Researchers such as Stevenson acknowledged these limitations.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule|title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|last=Shroder|first=Tom|date=11 February 2007|access-date=6 December 2011|work=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson also claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of [[xenoglossy]], including two where a subject under hypnosis allegedly conversed with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. [[Sarah Thomason]], a linguist (and skeptical researcher) at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason|Thomason, Sarah G.]]. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/xenogl.pdf "Xenoglossy"]. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors (Stevenson not among them) have given much importance to supposed past-life memories retrieved under hypnosis during [[past life regression]]s. Such supposed memories have been critiqued as containing historical inaccuracies originating from modern popular culture, common beliefs about history, or books that discuss historical events. Experiments with subjects undergoing past life regression indicate that a belief in reincarnation and suggestions by the hypnotist are the two most important factors regarding the contents of memories reported.&lt;ref name="Skepdic"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carroll RT|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions|title-link=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=Wiley|year=2003|isbn=978-0-471-27242-7|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA276 276–7]|author-link=Robert Todd Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spanos"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spanos NP|title=Multiple Identities &amp; False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] (APA)|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55798-340-4|pages=135–40|author-link=Nicholas Spanos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sumner"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vOLM-qpXdoC&amp;pg=PA50|title=Just Smoke and Mirrors: Religion, Fear and Superstition in Our Modern World|vauthors=Sumner D|publisher=Writers Club Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-595-26523-7|location=San Jose, [Calif.]|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of hypnosis and [[suggestive question]]s can tend to leave the subject particularly likely to hold distorted or [[False memory|false memories]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA206|title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience|vauthors=Linse P, Shermer M|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57607-653-8|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|pages=206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than recall of a previous existence, the source of the memories is more likely [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]]s that combine experiences, knowledge, imagination and [[suggestion]] or guidance from the hypnotist.  Once created, those memories are indistinguishable from memories based on events that occurred during the subject's life.&lt;ref name="Skepdic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cordon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cordón LA|url=https://archive.org/details/popularpsycholog0000cord/page/183|title=Popular psychology: an encyclopedia|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32457-4|location=Westport, Conn|pages=[https://archive.org/details/popularpsycholog0000cord/page/183 183–5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past-life regression has been critiqued for being unethical on the grounds that it lacks any evidence to support its claims and that it increases one's susceptibility to false memories. Luis Cordón states that this can be problematic as it creates [[delusion]]s under the guise of therapy. The memories are experienced as being as vivid as those based on events experienced in one's life and impossible to differentiate from true memories of actual events, and accordingly any damage can be difficult to undo.&lt;ref name="Cordon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrade_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Andrade G|date=December 2017|title=Is past life regression therapy ethical?|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=10|page=11|pmc=5797677|pmid=29416831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some APA accredited organizations have challenged the use of past-life regressions as a therapeutic method, calling it unethical. Additionally, the hypnotic methodology that underpins [[past-life regression]] has been criticized as placing the participant in a vulnerable position, susceptible to implantation of false memories.&lt;ref name="Andrade_2017" /&gt; Because the implantation of false memories may be harmful, Gabriel Andrade argues that past-life regression violates the principle of ''[[Primum non nocere|first, do no harm]]'' ([[Medical ethics#Non-maleficence|non-maleficence]]), part of the [[Hippocratic Oath]].&lt;ref name="Andrade_2017" /&gt;
