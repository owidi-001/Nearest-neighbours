'''Green Day''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]]&lt;!-- Do not change; this is the genre settled on for the lead section after much discussion on the talk page. Other genre labels are discussed further down and are listed in the infobox --&gt; band formed in the [[East Bay]] of [[California]] in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] and bassist and backing vocalist [[Mike Dirnt]]. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tré Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016. Green Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#Revival and mainstream success|late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major-label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.

Though the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[¡Uno!]]'', ''[[¡Dos!]]'', and ''[[¡Tré!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.

Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|access-date=February 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.

In 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have also collaborated together on the side projects [[Pinhead Gunpowder]], [[The Network]], [[Foxboro Hot Tubs]], [[The Longshot (band)|The Longshot]] and [[The Coverups]].

=== Breakthrough success (''Dookie'' and ''Insomniac'', 1994–1996) ===

In 1995, a single for the ''[[Angus (film)|Angus]]'' soundtrack was released, entitled "[[J.A.R.]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r223719|first=Steven|last=McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Green-Day/chart-history/MRT|title=Green Day Chart History (Alternative Airplay)|publisher=Billboard|access-date=February 19, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'', which was released in the fall of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/insomniac-mw0000645577 |title=Insomniac – Green Day |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=February 19, 2021 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916210932/http://www.allmusic.com/album/insomniac-mw0000645577 |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Insomniac'' was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic ''Dookie''.&lt;ref name="vh1 behind the music"/&gt; The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which said "In punk, the good stuff unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy.

=== Middle years and decline in commercial success (''Nimrod'' and ''Warning'', 1997–2002) ===
After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began work on its next album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitz|first=Marc|author-link=Marc Spitz|title=Nobody Likes You: Inside the Turbulent Life, Times, and Music of Green Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSWZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41|date=November 7, 2006|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-1-4013-8579-8|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'', an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, [[surf rock]], and [[ska]], to an acoustic ballad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Day stretches out on 'Nimrod'|last=Sullivan|first=Jim|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 10, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myers152153"&gt;Myers, 2006. pp. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nimrod'' entered the charts at number 10.

Green Day collaborated with [[Iggy Pop]] on two tracks for his album ''[[Skull Ring]]'' in November 2003. On February 1, 2004, a cover of "[[I Fought the Law]]" made its debut on a commercial for [[iTunes]] during [[NFL]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]".

Although Green Day has been compared to the Buzzcocks, the Ramones and the Clash, Mike Dirnt said he had never heard the Buzzcocks when Green Day began.&lt;ref name="snotty"/&gt; Dirnt said: "First off, you can't sound like any of those bands. And secondly, those are probably the last ones in my record collection."&lt;ref name="snotty"/&gt; Armstrong responded to Dirnt, saying: "Mine too. Those are all bands I got into later."&lt;ref name="snotty"/&gt; [[The Dickies]] is another band Green Day has been compared to.&lt;ref name="snotty"/&gt; Dirnt said he "never owned a Dickies album, although" he "did see" the Dickies live "around the time of" ''Kerplunk!''. Dirnt said "by that time, we'd played so many shows it had no bearing."&lt;ref name="snotty"/&gt; Armstrong referred to the Dickies as "just another Ramones rip-off".&lt;ref name="snotty"/&gt; Although in August 1996, Armstrong said bands like the Ramones are bands he listened to later, in June 2010, Armstrong cited the Ramones as an influence. He also said his "range of favorite songwriters goes anywhere from the Sex Pistols to [[Lennon–McCartney]].&lt;ref name=TenQuestions/&gt; During the ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'' era of Green Day, the band was influenced by The Who, [[U2]], [[Motown]] albums, and musicals such as ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-and-the-palace-of-wisdom-20050224|title=Green Day and the Palace of Wisdom|date=February 24, 2005|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608015044/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-and-the-palace-of-wisdom-20050224|archive-date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the band collaborated with theater director [[Michael Mayer (director)|Michael Mayer]] to adapt the group's [[rock opera]] ''American Idiot'' into a one-act stage [[American Idiot (musical)|musical]] that premiered at the [[Berkeley Rep]] on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of ''American Idiot: The Musical'' have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show "a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past." Jed Gottlieb of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' enjoyed the premise of the show but found that "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1248227&amp;position=0|title=Tale told by 'Idiot' lacks sound, fury|last=Gottlieb|first=Jay|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=April 19, 2010|access-date=December 19, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007042217/http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1248227&amp;position=0|archive-date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Kuchiwara of the [[Associated Press]] found the show to be "visually striking [and] musically adventurous", but noted that "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development". Paul Kolnik in ''[[USA Today]]'' enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative." He concluded that "''American Idiot'', despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers—for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway."&lt;ref&gt;Zoglin, Richard. "Punks Take Broadway", ''Time'' magazine, May 3, 2010, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Travers from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in his review of ''American Idiot'', wrote "Though ''American Idiot'' carries echoes of such rock musicals as ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you.

Green Day served as executive producers of ''[[Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk]]'' (2017), an extensive documentary film about the San Francisco Bay area punk scene from the late 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/turn-it-around-the-story-of-east-bay-punk-review-1202451514/ |title=Film Review: 'Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk' |author=Harvey, Dennis |date=June 2, 2017 |website=[[Variety.com]] |access-date=January 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Green Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and major-label status constitutes "true [[Punk rock|punk]]".&lt;ref name="softpedia2005"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Green-Day-Still-A-Punk-Band-10426.shtml|title= Green Day Still A Punk Band|date= October 5, 2005 |access-date=December 4, 2010|first=Mihaela|last=Stroia|publisher=Softpedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728121625/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Green-Day-Still-A-Punk-Band-10426.shtml|archive-date=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, [[John Lydon]], former frontman of the 1970s punk band the [[Sex Pistols]] commented, "So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=13310 |title=John Lydon Calls Green Day "Plonk" Not "Punk" |last=Melia |first=Daniel |access-date=September 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211060301/http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=13310 |archive-date=February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, "Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money—we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'"&lt;ref name="softpedia2005"/&gt;

On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&amp;B artist [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled "1 Minutes Left", saying "You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!" He also told the crowd he "was not [[Justin Bieber]]" and labeled the festival as a "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave [[the finger]], and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9zogQOmQVM/|title= Green Day Billie Joe freaks out at the I Heart Radio Music Festival and smashes guitar|access-date= October 16, 2013|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas" also adding that Armstrong would be headed to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/celebrities/index.ssf/2013/02/billie_joe_armstrong_rehab_1.html |title=Billie Joe Armstrong on pill-popping: Backpack sounded like 'giant baby's rattle' |work=NJ.com |date=February 28, 2013 |access-date=November 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224438/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/celebrities/index.ssf/2013/02/billie_joe_armstrong_rehab_1.html |archive-date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/09/23/green-days-billie-joe-armstrong-heads-to-rehab/70000969/1#.Ul9-UySXKAJ|title= Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong heads to rehab|date= September 23, 2012|access-date= October 16, 2013|website= USA today|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140113110018/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/09/23/green-days-billie-joe-armstrong-heads-to-rehab/70000969/1#.Ul9-UySXKAJ|archive-date= January 13, 2014|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/q-a-green-days-mike-dirnt-on-billie-joe-armstrongs-recovery-20130301|title=Q&amp;A: Green Day's Mike Dirnt on Billie Joe Armstrong's Recovery|access-date=October 2, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005201955/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/q-a-green-days-mike-dirnt-on-billie-joe-armstrongs-recovery-20130301|archive-date=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band later made amends with the company and played an album release party for their 2016 release, ''Revolution Radio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2016-10-12-green-day-iheartradio-album-release-party-on-att-iheartradio-theater-la-watch/|title=Green Day iHeartRadio Album Release Party On AT&amp;T iHeartRadio Theater LA (Watch)|work=iHeart Radio|date=October 12, 2016|accessdate=February 17, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iHeart16and19"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jem|last=Aswad|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/green-day-iheartradio-music-festival-1203333223/|title=Green Day to Perform at 2019 iHeartRadio Music Festival|work=Variety|date=September 12, 2019|accessdate=February 17, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also returned to the festival in 2019 supporting the album ''Father of All Motherfuckers''.&lt;ref name="iHeart16and19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-09-17-australia-news-green-day-to-return-to-iheartradio-music-festival-stage-joins-2019-lineup/|title=Green Day to Return to iHeartRadio Music Festival Stage, Joins 2019 Lineup|work=iHeart Radio|date=September 17, 2019|accessdate=February 17, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 7, 2017, about 20 minutes before Green Day headlined [[Mad Cool]], a festival in [[Madrid]], an acrobat fell about {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} from a cage above the stage and died. Some fans were upset at the band and festival organizers for continuing the show, which was attended by about 35,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/acrobat-plunges-100ft-death-mad-10758333|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708004859/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/acrobat-plunges-100ft-death-mad-10758333|url-status=dead|title=Acrobat plunges 100ft to death in front of 35,000 people at festival|first=Steve|last=Robson|date=July 7, 2017|archive-date=July 8, 2017|website=mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their website, Armstrong said the band did not know about the accident before their set, and likely would not have played if they had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/green-day-defends-performance-1.4196838|title='We are not heartless people': Green Day defends set after acrobat's death|website=Cbc.ca|access-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813013506/http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/green-day-defends-performance-1.4196838|archive-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
