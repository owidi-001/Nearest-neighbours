'''Jack Roosevelt Robinson''' (January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American professional [[baseball]] player who became the first African American to play in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson broke the [[baseball color line]] when he started at [[First baseman|first base]] for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] on April 15, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Braves at Brooklyn Dodgers Box Score, April 15, 1947|website=Baseball-Reference.com|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BRO/BRO194704150.shtml|access-date=April 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Dodgers signed Robinson, it heralded the end of [[racial segregation]] in professional baseball that had relegated [[List of first black Major League Baseball players by team|black players]] to the [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]] since the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Loewen"/&gt; Robinson was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1962 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1962]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie Robinson|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|url=http://www.baseballhall.org/hof/robinson-jackie|access-date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 10-year MLB career, Robinson won the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] in 1947, was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954, and won the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in 1949—the first black player so honored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nemec|Nemec &amp; Flatow]], p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BRef.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinja02.shtml |title=Jackie Robinson statistics and history |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson played in six [[World Series]] and contributed to the Dodgers' [[1955 World Series]] championship.

In 1997, MLB [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retired]] his uniform number 42 across all major league teams; he was the first professional athlete in any sport to be so honored. MLB also adopted a new annual tradition, "[[Jackie Robinson Day]]", for the first time on April 15, 2004, on which every player on every team wears No.&amp;nbsp;42.

Robinson's character, his use of [[nonviolence]], and his talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation that had then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the culture of and contributed significantly to the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=World &amp; I |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=257–273 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2003/march/mtpub.asp |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: precursors of the civil rights movement |access-date=September 14, 2009 |last=Glasser |first=Ira}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OneMeeting"&gt;{{cite web |work=MLB.com |url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&amp;content_id=2529821 |title=One meeting, two men, a changed world |first=Justice B. |last=Hill |date=April 15, 2008 |access-date=January 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415235609/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&amp;content_id=2529821&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb | archive-date=April 15, 2008 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, [[Chock full o'Nuts]]. In the 1960s, he helped establish the [[Freedom National Bank]], an African-American-owned financial institution based in [[Harlem]], New York. After his death in 1972, Robinson was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] and [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in recognition of his achievements on and off the field.

==Early life==
===Family and personal life===
Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] in [[Cairo, Georgia]]. He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (McGriff) and Jerry Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Matthew]] (nicknamed "Mack"), and Willa Mae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rampersad |first=Arnold |title=In Pharaoh's Land: Cairo, Georgia 1919–1920 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rampersad-robinson.html |access-date=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bigelow"&gt;[[#Bigelow|Bigelow]], p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; His middle name was in honor of former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who died 25 days before Robinson was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/kids/dreamteam/jackierobinson.html |title=White House dream team: Jackie Roosevelt Robinson |access-date=September 14, 2009 |date=January 20, 2002 |publisher=Whitehousekids.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |access-date=April 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415164600/http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |archive-date=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinsonp9"&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p17&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eigp10&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Muir High School===
In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at [[John Muir High School (Pasadena, California)|John Muir High School]] (Muir Tech).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics|silver medalist]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]])&lt;ref name=Eigp10/&gt; and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |title=Jackie Robinson biography |access-date=September 12, 2009 |publisher=The Biography Channel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610124614/http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |archive-date=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20/&gt;

At Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the [[varsity team|varsity level]] and [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] in four of them: [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name="Robinsonp9"/&gt; He played [[shortstop]] and [[catcher]] on the baseball team, [[quarterback]] on the football team, and [[Shooting guard|guard]] on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the [[long jump|broad jump]]. He was also a member of the [[tennis]] team.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famers]] [[Ted Williams]] and [[Bob Lemon]].&lt;ref name=Rampp37&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In late January 1937, the ''[[Pasadena Star-News]]'' newspaper reported that Robinson "for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pasadena Junior College===
After Muir, Robinson attended [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]] (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; On the football team, he played quarterback and [[Safety (American football position)|safety]]. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad-jump records held by his brother Mack.&lt;ref name=Robinsonp9/&gt; As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white.&lt;ref name=Rampp37/&gt; While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[Media:INTERVIEW Jackie Robinson U.pdf|Sports: Jackie Robinson]] |first=Bob |last=Stone |date=November 23, 1945 |work=[[Yank, the Army Weekly]] |volume=4 |issue=23 |type=PDF |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Robinson was one of 10 students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (''Omicron Mu Delta''), awarded to students performing "outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as [[Racism in the United States|racist]]—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.&lt;ref name="Linge, p. 18"&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.&lt;ref name=Robinson2p20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===UCLA and afterward===
[[File:Jackie robinson ucla track.jpg|thumb|alt=Athlete in UCLA track uniform at the apex of a jump, with legs lunging forward, against a background of an academic building.|upright|Robinson doing the long jump for UCLA]]

After graduating from PJC in spring 1939,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson enrolled at UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win [[varsity letter]]s in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memory1940/&gt;

He was one of four black players on the Bruins' [[1939 UCLA Bruins football team|1939 football team]]; the others were [[Woody Strode]], [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]], and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the team's four backfield players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/970425TeammatesRecall.aspx |title=Teammates Recall Jackie Robinson's Legacy |access-date=October 12, 2008 |last=Violett |first=B.J. |year=1997 |work=UCLA Today |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306163340/http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/970425TeammatesRecall.aspx |archive-date=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football, this made UCLA college football's most {{nowrap|integrated team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9389095 |title=Washington, Kenny |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=May 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106201058/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9389095 |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2007.00412.x |first=Lane |last=Demas |journal=History Compass |title=Beyond Jackie Robinson: racial integration in American college football and new directions in sport history |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=675–690 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} They went undefeated with four ties at {{nowrap|6–0–4.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/the-interrelated-back-stories-of-kenny-washington-reintegrating-the-nfl-in-1946-and-jackie-robinson-integrating-major-league-baseball-in-1947/ |access-date=November 25, 2017 |last=Stefani |first=Raymond |date=March 17, 2015 |work=The Sport Journal |title=The Interrelated Back Stories of Kenny Washington Reintegrating the NFL in 1946 and Jackie Robinson Integrating Major League Baseball in 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[track and field]], Robinson won the [[1940 NCAA Track and Field Championships#Long jump|1940 NCAA championship]] in the [[long jump]] at {{convert|24|ft|10+1/4|in|m|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/track_outdoor_champs_records/2006/MD1.pdf |access-date=March 10, 2013 |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Outdoor Track and Field: Division I Men's |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UCLA Bruins baseball|Baseball]] was Robinson's "worst sport" at UCLA; he hit .097 in his only season, although in his first game he went 4-for-4 and twice [[Stolen base|stole]] home.&lt;ref name=UCLAbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spotlight.ucla.edu/alumni/jackie-robinson/ |access-date=November 19, 2017 |last=Greenwald |first=Dave |date=February 1, 2005 |publisher=UCLA Athletics |title=Alumnus Jackie Robinson honored by Congress |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210090121/http://spotlight.ucla.edu/alumni/jackie-robinson/ |archive-date=December 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a senior at UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, [[Rachel Robinson|Rachel Isum]] (b.1922), a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson's athletic career {{nowrap|at PJC.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He played football as a senior, but the [[1940 UCLA Bruins football team|1940 Bruins]] won only one game.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring, Robinson left college just shy of graduation, despite the reservations of his mother and Isum.&lt;ref&gt;Sources point to various reasons for Robinson's departure from UCLA. Family sources cite financial concerns. {{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |access-date=April 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415164600/http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |archive-date=April 15, 2009 }} In addition, Robinson himself cited his growing disillusionment about the value of a college degree for a black man of his era. [[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 11. Other sources suggest that Robinson was uninterested in academics, and behind on class work at the time he left UCLA. [[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 45; [[#Eig|Eig]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government's [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA) {{nowrap|in [[Atascadero, California]].&lt;ref name="Gale Group"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/robinson_j.htm |title=Black History Biographies Jackie Robinson |access-date=November 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Gale (Cengage)|Gale Cengage Learning]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115020111/http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/robinson_j.htm |archive-date=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinsonp12&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Playing career==
===Negro leagues and major league prospects===
[[File:Jackie Robinson Kansas City Monarchs.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black man in baseball uniform with the letters "K" and "C" on the chest|Robinson during his stint in the Negro leagues with the [[Kansas City Monarchs]]]]
In early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam Huston College, the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues.&lt;ref name=enders/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson accepted a contract for $400 per month.&lt;ref name="Gale Group"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel|Tygiel]], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now communicate only by letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Robinson played 47 games at [[shortstop]] for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lester |first=Larry |author2=Sammy J. Miller  |title=Black Baseball in Kansas City |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2000 |page=55 |isbn=978-0-7385-0842-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the 1945 [[East–West All-Star Game]], going hitless in five at-bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lester |first=Larry |title=Black Baseball's National Showcase: The East–West All-Star Game, 1933–1953 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |page=457 |isbn=978-0-8032-8000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the season, Robinson pursued potential major league interests. No black man had played in the major leagues since [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] in 1884, but the [[Boston Red Sox]] nevertheless held a tryout at [[Fenway Park]] for Robinson and other black players on April 16.&lt;ref name=Bryantp31&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robertson &amp; Saunders|Robertson &amp; Saunders]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman [[Isadore H. Y. Muchnick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simon|Simon]], pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets.&lt;ref name=Npr2002&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/oct/redsox/ | title = The Boston Red Sox and Racism: With New Owners, Team Confronts Legacy of Intolerance | publisher = National Public Radio | date = October 11, 2002 | access-date = April 21, 2018 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405032805/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/oct/redsox/ | archive-date = April 5, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the tryout humiliated,&lt;ref name=Bryantp31/&gt; and more than 14 years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[MLB.com]] |title=Robinson's many peers follow his lead |url=http://mlbnetwork.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895202&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |last=O'Connell |first=Jack |date=April 13, 2007 |access-date=December 24, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822072051/http://mlbnetwork.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895202&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |archive-date=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, [[Branch Rickey]], club president and [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster.

Rickey's offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides, and he went home to Pasadena.
That September, he signed with [[Chet Brewer]]'s Kansas City Royals, a post-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] team in the [[California Winter League]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tygiel2|Tygiel (2002)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancée Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie (1995)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, the Rev.

===Major leagues===
====Breaking the color barrier (1947)====
In 1947, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season. With [[Eddie Stanky]] entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a [[first baseman]].&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Robinson made his debut in a Dodgers uniform wearing number 42 on April 11, 1947, in a preseason exhibition game against the New York Yankees at [[Ebbets Field]] with 24,237 in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--&gt; |title=Robinson makes debut|url= |work=Philadelphia Inquirer |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=April 12, 1947|page=14|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black.&lt;ref name=McNeil357/&gt; Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory.&lt;ref name=McNeil357&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson became the first player since 1884 to openly break the major league baseball color line.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[[#Kirsch, Harris &amp; Nolte|Kirsch, Harris &amp; Nolte]], [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofet0000unse_u6f6/page/12 pp. 12], 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.&lt;ref name="Satch2"/&gt;

Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.&lt;ref name=SABRbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a general survey of the media reaction to Robinson at various phases of his career, ''see'' [http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/jackie/proball.html www.umass.edu] and subpages.

The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed the team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was also derided by opposing teams.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giglio|Giglio]], [https://archive.org/details/musialfromstasht0000gigl/page/150 pp. 150]–151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a press report, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] threatened to [[Strike action|strike]] if Robinson played and to spread the walkout across the entire National League.&lt;ref name="strike"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Corbett|first=Warren|title=The 'Strike' Against Jackie Robinson: Truth or Myth?|journal=Baseball Research Journal|date=Spring 2017|volume=46|issue=1|pages=88–93|issn=0734-6891|url=https://sabr.org/research/strike-against-jackie-robinson-truth-or-myth|access-date=January 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existence of the plot was said to have been leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''{{'}}s [[Rutherford "Rud" Rennie]]. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his ''Tribune'' colleague and editor, [[Stanley Woodward (editor)|Stanley Woodward]], whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kahn|Kahn]], [https://archive.org/details/rickeyrobinsontr0000kahn/page/259 pp. 259]–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krell|first1=David|title= "Our Bums": The Brooklyn Dodgers in History, Memory and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=McFarland|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4766-1973-6|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RHNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giglio"&gt;Giglio, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The Woodward article made national headlines. After it was published, National League President [[Ford Frick]] and [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," Frick was quoted as saying. "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another."&lt;ref name="Giglio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward's article received the [[E.

Even ''[[Sporting News|The Sporting News]]'', a publication that had backed the color line, came out against the idea of a strike.&lt;ref name="strike"/&gt;

Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg from [[Enos Slaughter]].&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_jackie.html |title=Jackie Robinson integrates Baseball |access-date=September 14, 2009 |last=Wormser |first=Richard |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Phillies players and manager [[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]] called Robinson a "[[nigger]]" from their [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and yelled that he should "go back to the cotton fields".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams and Sielski|Williams and Sielski]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ken Burns|Burns, Ken]] (writer and director) |date=1994 |title=[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]], Part 6 |medium=Television production |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |time=minute 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickey later recalled that Chapman "did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers.

Robinson did, however, receive significant encouragement from several major league players. Robinson named [[Lee Handley|Lee "Jeep" Handley]], who played for the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him well.&lt;ref name=Astor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astor|first1=Gerald|title=The Baseball Hall of Fame 50th Anniversary Book|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall Press|pages=221–222|isbn=978-0-13-056573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgers teammate [[Pee Wee Reese]] once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, "You can hate a man for many reasons.

Robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the [[Dodgers]], with a [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .297, an [[on-base percentage]] of .383, and a .427 [[slugging percentage]]. He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 triples, and 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led the league in [[sacrifice hits]], with 28, and in stolen bases, with 29.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]] (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=roy_history |title=Rookies of the Year |work=[[MLB.com]] |access-date=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Stanky's trade to the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 [[fielding percentage]] that year (second in the [[National League]] at the position, fractionally behind Stanky).&lt;ref name="McNeil94"&gt;[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/individual_stats_player.jsp?c_id=mlb&amp;playerID=121314 |title=Historical Player Stats |access-date=October 11, 2008 |work=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 12–7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, 1948, he [[Hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]]—a [[home run]], a [[triple (baseball)|triple]], a [[double (baseball)|double]], and a [[single (baseball)|single]] in the same game.&lt;ref name="lester"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larrylester42.com/my-hero/ |title=My Hero&amp;nbsp;– Jackie Robinson |access-date=October 30, 2008 |last=Lester |first=Larry |year=2007 |publisher=LarryLester42.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120130946/http://www.larrylester42.com/my-hero |archive-date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the [[1948 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman |location=Lincoln |last=Lowenfish |first=Lee |year=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-1103-2 |chapter=A Year of Disappointment, Odd Choices, and an Adieu to Leo |page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 when a number of other black players entered the major leagues. [[Larry Doby]] (who broke the color barrier in the [[American League]] on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Robinson) and [[Satchel Paige]] played for the [[Cleveland Indians]], and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson.&lt;ref name="McNeil94"/&gt; In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12500|1948}}}} today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a [[vaudeville]] tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp {{Convert|30|lb|kg}} overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Wendell Smith's book, ''Jackie Robinson: My Own Story'', was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wendell Smith and Jackie Robinson|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|url=http://baseballhall.org/node/447|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer [[George Sisler]], working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; Robinson also noted that "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second".&lt;ref name=Sizzler/&gt; The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.&lt;ref name=Sizzler&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great |last=Huhn |first=Rick |year=2004 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |isbn=978-0-8262-1555-0 |chapter=Full circle |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 [[Run batted in|runs batted in]] with 122 runs scored.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; For the performance Robinson earned the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] for the National League.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the [[1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1949 All-Star Game]]—the first All-Star Game to include black players.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Robinson, the 1949 All-Star game featured [[Larry Doby]], [[Roy Campanella]], and [[Don Newcombe]].

Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the [[United States House of Representatives]]' [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor [[Paul Robeson]]. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Duberman|Duberman]], [https://archive.org/details/paulrobeson00duberich/page/361 pp. 361–362].&lt;/ref&gt;

He finished the year with 99 runs scored, a .328 batting average, and 12 stolen bases.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; The year saw the release of a film biography of Robinson's life, ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]'', in which Robinson played himself,&lt;ref name="LIFE1950"&gt;{{cite web |work=Life Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BE0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA129 |date=May 8, 1950 |title=Jackie Robinson's Double Play |page=129 |access-date=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actress [[Ruby Dee]] played Rachel "Rae" (Isum) Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogle|Bogle]], [https://archive.org/details/tomscoonsmulatto0004bogl/page/184 pp. 184–185].&lt;/ref&gt; The project had been previously delayed when the film's producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by a white man.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogle|Bogle]], [https://archive.org/details/tomscoonsmulatto0004bogl/page/184 p. 184].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Robinson, "doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogle|Bogle]], [https://archive.org/details/tomscoonsmulatto0004bogl/page/185 p. 185].&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner [[Walter O'Malley]], who referred to Robinson as "Rickey's [[prima donna]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stout|Stout]], p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stout|Stout]], p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Long|Long]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Jackie |year=1950 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jaraglet.html |title=Letter to Branch Rickey |publisher= Library of Congress |access-date=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/document-deep-dive-the-heartfelt-friendship-between-jackie-robinson-and-branch-rickey-19817525/?no-ist|title=Document Deep Dive: The Heartfelt Friendship Between Jackie Robinson and Branch Rickey|first=John|last=Hanc|date=April 10, 2013|magazine=Smithsonian|access-date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennant races and outside interests (1951–1953)====
Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the ''Montreal Standard'' as saying, "Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post"—although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robinson Linked to Montreal Job |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |agency=United Press |date=March 25, 1951 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TAMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3670,3811383&amp;hl=en |page=37 |access-date=September 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robinson Offered Managerial Berth |date=March 25, 1951 |page=27 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |agency=United Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5339,1955903&amp;hl=en |access-date=September 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137.&lt;ref name="lester"/&gt; He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game and then hit a home run in the 14th inning, which proved to be the winning margin. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitker|first=Steve|title=The Original San Francisco Giants: The Giants of '58|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2001|page=196|isbn=978-1-58261-335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, on October 3, 1951, the Dodgers lost the pennant on [[Bobby Thomson]]'s famous home run, known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]]. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster [[Vin Scully]] later noted that the incident showed "how much of a competitor Robinson was."&lt;ref name="Impact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2007/m04/d12/c1895331.jsp |title=Robinson made impact on field, too |access-date=October 11, 2008 |last=Bloom |first=Barry |date=April 13, 2007 |work=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream |page=154|title-link=#Dorinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; He did, however, record a career-high [[on-base percentage]] of .436.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the [[1952 World Series]] to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show ''Youth Wants to Know'', Robinson challenged the Yankees' general manager, [[George Weiss (baseball)|George Weiss]], on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |title=The Legacy of Race Through Time |access-date=October 28, 2008 |date=April 13, 1997 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408185940/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/04/13/1997-04-13_the_legacy__race_through_time.html |archive-date=April 8, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportswriter [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], whom Robinson had described as a "bigot", said, "If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the [[outfielder|outfield]], with [[Jim Gilliam]], another black player, taking over everyday second base duties.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Robinson's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the [[Puerto Rico Baseball League|Puerto Rican Winter League]], but according to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.&lt;ref name="Tygiel 2002, p. 34"&gt;[[#Tygiel2|Tygiel (2002)]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals,&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another [[1953 World Series|World Series]] loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued success spawned a string of death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Long|Long]], pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for ''Our Sports'' magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson's old friend [[Joe Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |title=Jackie Robinson and baseball highlights, 1860s–1960s |access-date=September 13, 2009 |date=September 26, 2002 |publisher=Library of Congress |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810071209/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//collections/jr/history.html |archive-date=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/robinson/jr1947.html |title=Robinson as a Dodger: 1947–1956 |work=Baseball, the Color Line, and Jackie Robinson |access-date=September 12, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star [[Chase Park Plaza Hotel|Chase Park Hotel]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Erskine and Rocks|Erskine and Rocks]], [https://archive.org/details/whatilearnedfrom00ersk/page/61 pp. 61]–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Championship and retirement (1954–1956)====
In 1954, Robinson had 62 runs scored, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lester"/&gt; The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the [[1955 World Series]]. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a [[third baseman]], both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson, then 36 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaikin|first=Bill|title=It's Jackie Robinson Day on Wednesday.

That season, the Dodgers' [[Don Newcombe]] became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nemec|Nemec &amp; Flatow]], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs scored, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of [[diabetes]] and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball.&lt;ref name="Tygiel 2002, p. 34"/&gt; Robinson ended his major league career when he struck out to end Game 7 of the [[1956 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nogowski|Nogowski]], pp. 43–44, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, the Dodgers traded Robinson to the arch-rival [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] for [[Dick Littlefield]] and $35,000 cash (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1956}}}} today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of [[Chock full o'Nuts]] to quit baseball and become an executive with the company.&lt;ref name=Lingep114&gt;[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'']] magazine two years previously,&lt;ref name=Lingep114/&gt; his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.&lt;ref name=mlb.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070603&amp;content_id=2003372&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Jackie Robinson: Gone but not forgotten |access-date=May 5, 2019 |last=Bloom |first=Barry M. |date=June 4, 2007 |work=[[MLB.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302110739/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070603&amp;content_id=2003372&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |archive-date=March 2, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the [[baseball color line]].&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated [[Great Migration (African American)|migration to the North]], where their political clout grew, and [[Harry Truman|President Harry Truman]]'s [[Military history of African Americans|desegregation of the military]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/opinion/better-late-than-never.html|title=Better Late Than Never|last=Klarman|first=Michael J. |date=May 17, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. [[Civil rights movement]] leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] said that he was "a legend and a symbol in his own time", and that he "challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/03/02/a_pioneer_in_civil_rights/|title=A pioneer in civil rights|last=Robinson|first=Rachel|author2=[[John Kerry]] |date=March 2, 2005|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=April 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], Robinson's "efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America&amp;nbsp;... [His] accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams and Sielski|Williams and Sielski]], [https://archive.org/details/howtobelikejacki0000will/page/211 pp. 211–212].&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of 28, he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.&lt;ref name="Sports 20000"/&gt; During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.&lt;ref name="BRef.com"/&gt; In 1999, he was posthumously named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp?story=2|title=The All-Century Team|year=1999|work=MLB.com|access-date=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post–"long ball" era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream |pages=151–152|title-link=#Dorinson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more [[base on balls|walks]] than [[strikeout]]s (740 to 291).&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sports 20000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |title=The No. 1 Most Significant Development in the 20th Century |access-date=October 31, 2008 |last=Kindred |first=Dave |date=July 1999 |work=[[The Sporting News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012124045/http://sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/170132.html |archive-date=October 12, 1999 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1783632 |title=Remembering Jackie Robinson |access-date=October 31, 2008 |last=Simon |first=Mark |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=April 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947–56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 ([[Minnie Miñoso]] was the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/04/19/SP68618.DTL |title=By The Numbers – Robinson Was All-Around Player |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Camps |first=Mark |date=April 7, 1997 |access-date=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; including 19 steals of home.

==Post-baseball life==
Robinson once told future Hall of Fame inductee [[Hank Aaron]] that "the game of baseball is great, but the greatest thing is what you do after your career is over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Patrick|first=Dan|title=Just My Type|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=November 7, 2016|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jackie_Robinson_1919&amp;page=chronology |title=Jackie Robinson Career Chronology |access-date=May 4, 2009 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108063012/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jackie_Robinson_1919&amp;page=chronology |archive-date=January 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, he was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], a disease that also afflicted his brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 319–320.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1959, Robinson entered the [[Greenville Downtown Airport|Greenville Municipal Airport]]'s whites-only waiting room. Airport police asked Robinson to leave, but he refused. At a [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) speech in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], Robinson urged "complete freedom" and encouraged black citizens to vote and to protest their second-class citizenship. The following January, approximately 1,000 people [[New Year's Day March (Greenville, 1960)|marched on New Year's Day]] to the airport,&lt;ref name="Zinn Education Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/greenville-airport-protest/|title=Jan. 1, 1960: Greenville Airport Protest|publisher=Zinn Education Project|access-date=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenville News (Archive)"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2019/07/12/archive-jackie-robinson-visits-greenville-speaks-sc-naacp-complete-freedom/1702929001/|access-date=May 24, 2020|title=Jackie Robinson urged blacks to work toward 'complete freedom' during 1959 Greenville visit|work=The Greenville News|date=July 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was desegregated shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History museum exhibit explores Greenville's civil rights struggles, successes|work=The Greenville News|date=January 17, 2014|url=https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/entertainment/2014/01/12/history-museum-exhibit-explores-greenvilles-civil-rights-struggles-successes/4437311/|access-date=June 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had emotional trouble during his childhood and entered special education at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled in the Army in search of a disciplined environment, served in the [[Vietnam War]], and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; After his discharge, he struggled with drug problems.

Major League Baseball has honored Robinson many times since his death. In 1987, both the National and American League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] Awards were renamed the "Jackie Robinson Award" in honor of the first recipient (Robinson's Major League Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 encompassed both leagues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor=Wulf, Steve |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066214/index.htm |title=Scorecard: 'Nicely Done' |access-date=May 12, 2019 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=July 27, 1987 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501172804/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066214/index.htm |archive-date=May 1, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloss|first=Bob|title=Rookies of the Year|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=6–7|isbn=978-1-59213-164-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 1997, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired throughout Major League Baseball, the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the [[Major North American professional sports teams|four major American sports leagues]].

Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida.

On November 22, 2014, UCLA announced that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports, effective immediately.

A jersey that Robinson brought home with him after his rookie season ended in 1947 was sold at an auction for $2.05&amp;nbsp;million on November 19, 2017.
