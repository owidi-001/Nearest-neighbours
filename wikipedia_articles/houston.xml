The arrival of the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad industry, the decline of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] as Texas's primary port following [[1900 Galveston hurricane|a devastating 1900 hurricane]], the subsequent construction of the [[Houston Ship Channel]], and the [[Texas oil boom]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In the mid-20th century, Houston's economy diversified, as it became home to the [[Texas Medical Center]]—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]], home to the [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]].

Houston's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment, Houston has the second-most [[Fortune 500|''Fortune'' 500]] headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits (after [[New York City]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/cities/ ''Fortune'' 500 2010: Cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824184919/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/cities/ |date=August 24, 2011 }} Accessed May 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kearney"&gt;{{cite web |title=A.T.

Nicknamed the "Bayou City", "Space City", "H-Town", and "the [[713 area code|713]]", Houston has become a [[global city]], with strengths in culture, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. Houston is the [[Demographics of Houston|most diverse metropolitan area]] in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major metropolis in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/houston-most-diverse_n_1321089.html |work=Huffington Post |title=Houston Surpasses New York And Los Angeles As The 'Most Diverse In Nation' |access-date=April 12, 2018 |date=March 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170609/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/houston-most-diverse_n_1321089.html |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7&amp;nbsp;million visitors a year to the [[Houston Museum District|Museum District]].

{{Main|History of Houston|Timeline of Houston}}

The Houston area is on land that was home of the [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]] (kə rang′kə wä′,-wô′,-wə) and the [[Atakapa]] (əˈtɑːkəpə) indigenous peoples for at least 2,000 years before the first known settlers arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=LIPSCOMB|first=CAROL A.|date=June 15, 2010|title=KARANKAWA INDIANS|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmk05|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=tshaonline.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=COUSER|first=DOROTHY|date=June 9, 2010|title=ATAKAPA INDIANS|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bma48|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=tshaonline.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Layman|first=George J.|date=December 31, 2019|title=Karankawas were among the First Texas Indians Encountered by Europeans|url=https://www.historynet.com/karankawas-were-among-the-first-texas-indians-encountered-by-europeans.htm|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=HistoryNet|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes are almost nonexistent today; this was most likely caused by foreign disease, and competition with various settler groups in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 31, 2013|title=Houston's Native American Heritage Runs Deep|url=https://houstonfamilymagazine.com/features/houstons-native-american-heritage-runs-deep/|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=Houston Family Magazine|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the land remained largely uninhabited until settlement in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=June 9, 2010|title=AUSTIN, JOHN|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fau09|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=tshaonline.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early settlement to the 20th century ===
The Allen brothers—[[Augustus Chapman Allen|Augustus Chapman]] and [[John Kirby Allen|John Kirby]]—explored town sites on Buffalo Bayou and [[Galveston Bay]]. According to historian David McComb, "[T]he brothers, on August 26, 1836, bought from Elizabeth E. Parrott, wife of T.F.L. Parrott and widow of John Austin, the south half of the lower league [{{convert|2214|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract] granted to her by her late husband. They paid $5,000 total, but only $1,000 of this in cash; notes made up the remainder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Houston: A History |first=David G. |last=McComb |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1981 |edition=2nd |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allen brothers ran their first advertisement for Houston just four days later in the ''Telegraph and Texas Register'', naming the notional town in honor of President Sam Houston.&lt;ref name="HouHTO" /&gt; They successfully lobbied the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas|Republic of Texas Congress]] to designate Houston as the temporary capital, agreeing to provide the new government with a state capitol building.&lt;ref name="tsha_AC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Allen, Augustus Chapman |first=Amelia W. |last=Williams |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |series=Handbook of Texas Online |access-date=April 12, 2018 |date=August 24, 2016 |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212254/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal17 |archive-date=April 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; About a dozen persons resided in the town at the beginning of 1837, but that number grew to about 1,500 by the time the Texas Congress convened in Houston for the first time that May.&lt;ref name="HouHTO" /&gt; The Republic of Texas granted Houston incorporation on June 5, 1837, as [[James Sanders Holman|James S. Holman]] became its first mayor.&lt;ref name="HouHTO" /&gt; In the same year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County (now Harris County).&lt;ref name="SHQa4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Looscan |first=Adele B. |title=Harris County, 1822–1845 |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |volume=19 |pages=37–64 |year=1914 |url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth101064/m1/201/ |access-date=March 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327054226/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth101064/m1/201/ |archive-date=March 27, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, the Republic of Texas relocated its capital to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The town suffered another setback that year when a yellow fever epidemic claimed about one life for every eight residents, yet it persisted as a commercial center, forming a symbiosis with its Gulf Coast port, Galveston. Landlocked farmers brought their produce to Houston, using Buffalo Bayou to gain access to Galveston and the Gulf of Mexico. Houston merchants profited from selling staples to farmers and shipping the farmers' produce to Galveston.&lt;ref name=HouHTO/&gt;

The great majority of enslaved people in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. [[New Orleans]] was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] black people lived near the city before the [[American Civil War]]. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=December 21, 2016|title=Blood and Sugar|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/sugar-land-slave-convict-labor-history/|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=Texas Monthly|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce, in part to promote shipping and navigation at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm |first=John |last=Perry |title=Born on the Bayou: city's murky start|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218055155/http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/sum06/sum06_heritage.htm |archive-date=December 18, 2011 |work=City Savvy |edition=Online |date=Summer 2006 |publisher=City of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and [[Railroad|railroad hub]] for the export of cotton.&lt;ref name="SHQa4" /&gt; Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General [[John B.

By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|hurricane]], efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/governors/rising/sayers-galv.html J.H.W.

By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed a large part of the city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of Houston's residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonhistory.com/decades/history5h.htm |title=Marvin Hurley, 1910–1920, Houston History |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419095802/http://www.houstonhistory.com/decades/history5h.htm |archive-date=April 19, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] opened the deep-water Port of Houston in 1914, seven years after digging began. By 1930, Houston had become Texas's most populous city and Harris County the most populous county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gibson |first=Campbell |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |date=June 1998 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/1998/demo/POP-twps0027.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005195810/http://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/1998/demo/POP-twps0027.html |archive-date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported Houston's population as 77.5% White and 22.4% Black.&lt;ref name="census1"/&gt;

=== World War II to the late 20th century ===
When [[United States home front during World War II|World War II]] started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war.&lt;ref name="shipchannel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Houston Ship Channel |work=TSHA Handbook of Texas |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rhh11 |access-date=May 5, 2015 |date=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201105943/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rhh11 |archive-date=February 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellington Airport (Texas)|Ellington Field]], initially built during [[World War I]], was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carlson |first=Erik |title=Ellington Field: A Short History, 1917–1963 |work=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date=February 1999 |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/ellington/Ellington.pdf |access-date=February 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102113204/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/ellington/Ellington.pdf |archive-date=November 2, 2006 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brown Shipbuilding Company]] was founded in 1942 to build ships for the [[U.S. Navy]] during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of [[Anti-discrimination law|nondiscrimination]] for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Race, Roosevelt, and Wartime Production: Fair Employment in World War II Labor Markets |first=William J. |last=Collins |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=91 |number=1 |date=March 2001 |pages=272–286 |publisher=American Economic Association |jstor=2677909 |doi=10.1257/aer.91.1.272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the M.D. Anderson Foundation formed the [[Texas Medical Center]]. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being primarily port-driven. In 1948, the city annexed several unincorporated areas, more than doubling its size. Houston proper began to spread across the region.&lt;ref name=HouHTO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Streetman |first=Ashley |title=Houston Timeline |work=Houston Institute for Culture |url=http://www.houstonculture.org/resources/houstontime.html |access-date=February 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208185328/http://www.houstonculture.org/resources/houstontime.html |archive-date=December 8, 2006 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston, where wages were lower than those in [[Northern United States|the North]]; this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the city's economy toward the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldhouseweb.com/stories/Detailed/725.shtml "How Air Conditioning Changed America"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213053143/http://www.oldhouseweb.com/stories/Detailed/725.shtml |date=December 13, 2006 }}, ''The Old House Web'', Retrieved on April 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hgs.org/en/articles/printview.asp?26 "A Short History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216122901/http://www.hgs.org/en/articles/printview.asp?26 |date=February 16, 2007 }}, ''Houston Geological Auxiliary'', Retrieved on April 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1970s, Houston had a population boom as people from the [[Rust Belt]] states moved to Texas in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://texasalmanac.com/topics/culture/polish/polish-texans |title=Polish-Texans |work=Texas Almanac 2004–2005 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703162430/https://texasalmanac.com/topics/culture/polish/polish-texans |archive-date=July 3, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]].

In June 2001, [[Tropical Storm Allison]] dumped up to {{convert|40|in|mm}} of rain on parts of Houston, causing what was then the worst flooding in the city's history.

The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 Harris County] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203083934/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 |date=December 3, 2017 }}.

[[File:Hurricane-Tropical Storm Harvey in Houston - August 27 2017 AM (36032737983).jpg|thumb|Flooded parking lot during Hurricane Harvey, August 2017]]
Because of Houston's [[wet season]] and proximity to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], the city is prone to flooding from heavy rains; the most notable flooding events include [[Tropical Storm Allison]] in 2001 and [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017, along with most recent [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] in 2019 and [[Tropical Storm Beta (2020)|Tropical Storm Beta]] in 2020. In response to [[Hurricane Harvey]], Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston initiated plans to require developers to build homes that will be less susceptible to flooding by raising them two feet above the [[100-year flood|500-year floodplain]]. Hurricane Harvey damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and dumped trillions of gallons of water into the city.&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Cardenas|first1=Cat|last2=Formby|first2=Brandon|work=The Texas Tribune|date=April 4, 2018 |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/04/houston-city-council-approves-changes-floodplain-regulations-narrow-vo/ |title=Houston council approves changes to floodplain regulations in effort to reduce flood damage |access-date=January 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609023026/https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/04/houston-city-council-approves-changes-floodplain-regulations-narrow-vo/ |archive-date=June 9, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In places this led to feet of standing water that blocked streets and flooded homes. The Houston City Council passed this regulation in 2018 with a vote of 9–7. Had these floodplain development rules had been in place all along, it is estimated that 84% of homes in the 100-year and 500-year floodplains would have been spared damage.{{dubious|date=January 2020}}&lt;ref name="regulations" /&gt;

In a recent case testing these regulations, near the Brickhouse Gulley, an old golf course that long served as a floodplain and reservoir for flood waters, announced a change of heart toward intensifying development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/business/2018/08/houston-one-year-after-hurricane-harvey-is-at-a-crossroads.html |title=And the Waters Will Prevail |access-date=November 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106183516/https://slate.com/business/2018/08/houston-one-year-after-hurricane-harvey-is-at-a-crossroads.html |archive-date=November 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A nation-wide developer, [[Meritage Homes]], bought the land and planned to develop the 500-year floodplain into 900 new residential homes. Their plan would bring in $360 million in revenue and boost city population and tax revenue. In order to meet the new floodplain regulations, the developers needed to elevate lowest floors two feet above the 500 year floodplain, equivalent to five or six feet above the 100-year base flood elevation, and build a channel to direct stormwater runoff toward detention basins. Before Hurricane Harvey, the city had bought back $10.7 million in houses in this area specifically to take them out of danger. After Hurricane Harvey this sudden change of heart seems likely to have been motivated by the prospect of additional tax revenues. In addition to developing new streets and single-family housing within a floodplain, a flowing flood-water stream termed a floodway runs through the development area, a most dangerous place to encounter during any future flooding event.&lt;ref name="billion"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/What-s-in-a-floodway-In-Houston-20-000-12409821.php |title=What's in Houston's worst flood zones?

In 2013, Houston was identified as the number one U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn, but also after the crash, more than two jobs were added for every one lost. Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, Jankowski stated that "more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, expanded or started new businesses in Houston" between 2008 and 2010, and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; Also in 2013, Houston again appeared on ''Forbes''' list of "Best Places for Business and Careers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Best Places For Business and Careers – Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/best-places-for-business/ |magazine=Forbes |access-date=January 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808004953/http://www.forbes.com/best-places-for-business |archive-date=August 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study by the [[Rice University]] Kinder Institute for Urban Research found 56% of Harris County residents have a preference for dense housing in a mixed-use, walkable setting as opposed to single-family housing in a low-density area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://kinder.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Kinder_Institute_for_Urban_Research/HAS/2017%20Kinder%20Houston%20Area%20Survey%20FINAL.pdf |title=The Kinder Houston Area Survey: Thirty-Six Years of Measuring Responses to a Changing America |last=Klineberg |first=Stephen L. |date=May 2017 |website=Kinder Institute for Urban Research, Rice University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013234123/http://kinder.rice.edu/uploadedFiles/Kinder_Institute_for_Urban_Research/HAS/2017%20Kinder%20Houston%20Area%20Survey%20FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plurality of survey respondents also indicated traffic congestion was the most significant problem facing the metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, many households in the city of Houston have no car.

Greater Houston possesses a [[Spoke–hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] limited-access highway system, in which a number of freeways radiate outward from Downtown, with [[ring road]]s providing connections between these radial highways at intermediate distances from the city center. The city is crossed by three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]], [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]], [[Interstate 45]], and [[Interstate 69]] (commonly known as [[U.S. Route 59]]), as well as a number of other [[United States Numbered Highway System|United States routes]] and [[Texas state highway system|state highways]]. Major freeways in Greater Houston are often referred to by either the cardinal direction or geographic location they travel towards. Highways that follow the cardinal convention include [[U.S. Route 290]] (''Northwest Freeway''), Interstate 45 north of Downtown (''North Freeway''), Interstate 10 east of Downtown ''(East Freeway''), [[Texas State Highway 288]] (''South'' ''Freeway''), and Interstate 69 south of Downtown (''Southwest Freeway''). Highways that follow the location convention include Interstate 10 west of Downtown (''[[Katy, Texas|Katy]] Freeway''), Interstate 69 north of Downtown (''[[East Texas|Eastex]] Freeway''), Interstate 45 south of Downtown (''[[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] Freeway''), and [[Texas State Highway 225]] (''[[La Porte, Texas|La Porte]]'' or ''[[Pasadena, Texas|Pasadena]] Freeway'').

Three loop freeways provide north–south and east–west connectivity between Greater Houston's radial highways. The innermost loop is [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]], commonly known as the ''Inner Loop'', which encircles Downtown, the [[Texas Medical Center]], [[Greenway Plaza]], the cities of [[West University Place, Texas|West University Place]] and [[Southside Place, Texas|Southside Place]], and many core neighborhoods. The {{Convert|88|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|State Highway Beltway&amp;nbsp;8]], often referred to as ''the Beltway'', forms the middle loop at a radius of roughly {{Convert|10|mi|km}}. A third, {{Convert|180|mi|km|adj=on}} loop with a radius of approximately {{Convert|25|mi|km}}, [[Texas State Highway 99|State Highway&amp;nbsp;99]] (the ''Grand Parkway''), is currently under construction, with six of eleven segments completed {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh99-grand-parkway.html |title=SH 99 / Grand Parkway Project |date=2018 |website=Texas Department of Transportation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304020957/https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh99-grand-parkway.html|archive-date=March 4, 2018|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed segments D through G provide a continuous {{Convert|70.4|mi|km|adj=on}} limited-access tollway connection between [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], [[Katy, Texas|Katy]], [[Cypress, Texas|Cypress]], [[Spring, Texas|Spring]], and [[Porter, Texas|Porter]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A system of toll roads, operated by the [[Harris County Toll Road Authority]] (HCTRA) and [[Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority]] (FBCTRA), provides additional options for regional commuters. The Sam Houston Tollway, which encompasses the mainlanes of Beltway 8 (as opposed to the [[frontage road]]s, which are untolled), is the longest tollway in the system, covering the entirety of the Beltway with the exception of a free section between Interstate 45 and Interstate 69 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The region is serviced by four spoke tollways: a set of [[managed lane]]s on the Katy Freeway; the [[Hardy Toll Road]], which parallels Interstate 45 north of Downtown up to [[Spring, Texas|Spring]]; the [[Westpark Tollway]], which services Houston's western suburbs out to [[Fulshear, Texas|Fulshear]]; and [[Fort Bend Parkway]], which connects to [[Sienna Plantation, Texas|Sienna Plantation]]. Westpark Tollway and Fort Bend Parkway are operated conjunctly with the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority.

Greater Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar, a partnership of four government agencies which is responsible for providing transportation and [[emergency management]] services to the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstontranstar.org/about_transtar/ About Houston TranStar] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64ycclYYC?url=http://www.houstontranstar.org/about_transtar/ |date=January 26, 2012 }}.

Greater Houston's [[arterial road]] network is established at the municipal level, with the City of Houston exercising planning control over both its [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] area and [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] (ETJ). Therefore, Houston exercises transportation planning authority over a {{Convert|2000|mi2|km2|adj=on}} area over five counties, many times larger than its corporate area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/transportation/docs_pdfs/2015_PolicyStatement.pdf |title=Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan Policy Statement |date=March 2015 |website=City of Houston |access-date=March 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321063323/http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/transportation/docs_pdfs/2015_PolicyStatement.pdf |archive-date=March 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan'', updated annually, establishes the city's [[street hierarchy]], identifies roadways in need of widening, and proposes new roadways in unserved areas. Arterial roads are organized into four categories, in decreasing order of intensity: ''major thoroughfares'', ''transit corridor streets'', ''collector streets'', and ''local streets''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Roadway classification affects anticipated traffic volumes, roadway design, and [[right of way]] breadth. Ultimately, the system is designed to ferry traffic from neighborhood streets to major thoroughfares, which connect into the limited-access highway system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Notable arterial roads in the region include [[Westheimer Road]], [[Memorial Drive (Houston)|Memorial Drive]], [[Texas State Highway 6]], [[Farm to Market Road 1960]], [[Bellaire Boulevard]], and [[Telephone Road]].
