It's like this kind of code that once you start to inhabit it with breath and sound and feeling and thought, it is the most powerful and consuming and freeing at the same time. Just, literally, elemental in sound, consonants and vowels. What I found out in doing it ''[Hamlet]'' was that it brought up for me all the anger that was inside me for my mother. I mean, it surprised me, just what was there, and I hadn't seen that before.

}}Following ''Speed'', Reeves' next leading role came in 1995, in the [[cyberpunk]] action thriller ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''. It is based on the story of the [[Johnny Mnemonic|same title]] by [[William Gibson]], about a man who has had a [[cybernetic]] [[brain implant]].

Film critic [[Mick LaSalle]] opined that "''A Walk in the Clouds'' is for the most part a beautiful, well-acted and emotionally rich picture", whereas Hal Hinson from ''The Washington Post'' said, "The film has the syrupy, [[Kodak]] magic-moment look of a [[Bo Derek]] movie, and pretty much the same level of substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|author-link=Mick LaSalle|date=August 11, 1995|title=Movie Review / Reeves Takes 'Walk' And Runs With It|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/MOVIE-REVIEW-Reeves-Takes-Walk-And-Runs-With-3026860.php|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412204506/https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/MOVIE-REVIEW-Reeves-Takes-Walk-And-Runs-With-3026860.php|archive-date=April 12, 2020|access-date=April 12, 2020|website=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/awalkinthecloudspg13hinson_c027c0.htm|title=A Walk in the Clouds|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=April 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021601/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/awalkinthecloudspg13hinson_c027c0.htm|archive-date=October 11, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides film work, Reeves retreated briefly to the theatre playing [[Prince Hamlet]] in a 1995 [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]] production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.mb.ca/news.aspx?id=1356 |title=Manitoba Theatre Centre: News |publisher=Mtc.mb.ca |access-date=May 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213120333/http://www.mtc.mb.ca/news.aspx?id=1356 |archive-date=February 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' critic [[Roger Lewis]] believed his performance, writing he "quite embodied the innocence, the splendid fury, the animal grace of the leaps and bounds, the emotional violence, that form the Prince of Denmark&amp;nbsp;... He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen, for a simple reason: he ''is'' Hamlet".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' Volume 58, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves was soon drawn to science fiction roles, appearing in ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'' (1996) with co-stars [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Kevin Dunn]] and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. He plays a researcher of a [[Sustainable energy|green energy]] project, who has to go on the run when he is [[Frameup|framed]] for murder. ''Chain Reaction'' was not a critical success and gained mostly a negative reaction; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 16% and described it as "a man-on-the-run thriller that mostly sticks to generic formula".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chain Reaction (1996)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1072457_chain_reaction|work=Rotten Tomatoes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106151324/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1072457_chain_reaction|language=en|access-date=April 12, 2020|archive-date=November 6, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves' film choices after ''Chain Reaction'' were also critical disappointments. He starred in the independent crime comedy ''[[Feeling Minnesota]]'' (1996), with [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] and [[Cameron Diaz]], which was described as "shoddily assembled, and fundamentally miscast" by Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Feeling Minnesota (1996)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/feeling_minnesota|work=Rotten Tomatoes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920121920/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/feeling_minnesota|language=en|access-date=April 13, 2020|archive-date=September 20, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, he turned down an offer to star in ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]'', despite being offered a salary of $12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Portman|first=Jamie|title=Keanu not sequel to the task|date=September 13, 1996|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reeves, this decision caused [[20th Century Fox]] to sever ties with him for a decade.&lt;ref name="gq cover"&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.gq.com/story/the-legend-of-keanu-reeves | title = The Legend of Keanu Reeves | first = Alex | last = Pappademos | date = April 15, 2019 | access-date = April 15, 2019 | magazine = [[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190415131631/https://www.gq.com/story/the-legend-of-keanu-reeves | archive-date = April 15, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Reeves toured with his band Dogstar, and appeared in the drama ''[[The Last Time I Committed Suicide]]'' (1997), based on a 1950 letter written by [[Neal Cassady]] to [[Jack Kerouac]].

After the success of ''The Matrix'', Reeves avoided another blockbuster in favour of a lighthearted sports comedy, ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]'' (2000).

They had worked together previously in ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'', ''A Scanner Darkly'' and ''The Private Lives of Pippa Lee''. Reeves also co-produced and starred in two thrillers. ''[[Siberia (2018 film)|Siberia]]'', in which he plays a [[diamond]] trader who travels to [[Siberia]] to search for his Russian partner, and ''[[Replicas (film)|Replicas]]'', which tells the story of a [[neuroscientist]] who violates laws and [[bioethics]] to bring his family back to life after they die in a car crash. ''Siberia'' was critically panned; reviewers thought the plot was nonsensical and Reeves had little chemistry with co-star [[Ana Ularu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lowe|first=Justin|date=2018-07-13|title='Siberia': Film Review {{!}} Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/siberia-1126847|access-date=2020-10-17|website=www.hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Stewart|first=Sara|date=2018-07-13|title='Siberia' is a cold, empty thriller|url=https://nypost.com/2018/07/13/siberia-is-a-cold-empty-thriller/|access-date=2020-10-17|website=New York Post|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Replicas'' did not fare well with critics either; ''The A.V.

Returning to the ''John Wick'' franchise, Reeves starred in ''[[John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum]]'' (2019), the third feature in the series directed by Stahelski. The film takes place immediately after the events of ''John Wick: Chapter 2'' and features new cast members including [[Halle Berry]].
