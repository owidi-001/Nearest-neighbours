The Massachusetts colonial legislature, the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]], authorized Harvard's founding. In its early years, [[Harvard College]] primarily trained [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] clergy, although it has never been formally affiliated with any [[Religious denomination|denomination]]. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among [[Boston Brahmin|the Boston elite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Harvard and the Boston Brahmins: A Study in Institutional and Class Development, 1800–1865|last=Story|first=Ronald|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=8|issue=3 |year=1975|pages=94–121|doi=10.1353/jsh/8.3.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Betty G.|title=Elite Families: Class and Power in Nineteenth-Century Boston|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1593-7|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the [[American Civil War]], President [[Charles William Eliot]]'s long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the [[Harvard College|college]] and affiliated professional schools into a modern [[research university]]; Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="AAU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476|title=Member Institutions and years of Admission|publisher=Association of American Universities|access-date=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James B. Conant]] led the university through the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]; he liberalized admissions after the war.

The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].

Harvard was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].
In 1638, it acquired [[British North America]]'s first known printing press.&lt;ref name="FirstPrintingPress"&gt;{{cite web|title=The instrument behind New England's first literary flowering|date=March 8, 2012|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/harvard's-first-impressions/|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UHullMHSC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rowley and Ezekiel Rogers, The First North American Printing Press|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/mhsc/FarHorizons/Documents/EzekielRogers.pdf|publisher=Maritime Historical Studies Centre, University of Hull|access-date=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1639, it was named [[Harvard College]] after deceased clergyman [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], an alumnus of the [[University of Cambridge]] who had left the school £779 and his library of some 400 volumes.&lt;ref name="JH facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Harvard Facts, Information. |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/John_Harvard.aspx|publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008|access-date=July 17, 2009|quote=He bequeathed £780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new established college at Cambridge, Mass., which was named in his honor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The charter creating the [[Harvard Corporation]] was granted in 1650.

A 1643 publication gave the school's purpose as "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Louis B. |last=Wright|title=The Cultural Life of the American Colonies|year=2002|page=116|isbn=978-0-486-42223-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1708, [[John Leverett the Younger|John Leverett]] became the first president who was not also a clergyman, marking a turning of the college away from Puritanism and toward intellectual independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.harvard.edu/history/07_leverett.php John Leverett - History - Office of the President] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612033858/http://www.president.harvard.edu/history/07_leverett.php | date=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of reason and free will were widespread among [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.&lt;ref name=Dorrien&gt;Gary J.

[[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected to the Hollis chair in 1805, and the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] was appointed to the presidency two years later, signaling the shift from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas.&lt;ref name=Dorrien /&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref&gt;Peter S.

[[Charles William Eliot]], president 1869–1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was the crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education but by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions influenced by [[William Ellery Channing]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stephen P.|last=Shoemaker|title=The Theological Roots of Charles W.

Programs in the study of [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] languages began in 1816 with [[George Ticknor]] as its first professor.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Rummell, Richard Harvard University.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor landscape view, facing northeast.&lt;ref name="http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/iconic-college-view-harvard-university.html"&gt;[http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/iconic-college-view-harvard-university.html "Arader Galleries Iconic College Views"], ''Rummell, Richard'', Littig &amp; Co. 1915&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the [[Harvard College|undergraduate college]] expanded. [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879 as the female counterpart of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="AAU" /&gt;

The student body in the early decades of the century was predominantly "old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians." A 1923 proposal by President [[A. Lawrence Lowell]] that Jews be limited to 15% of undergraduates was rejected, but Lowell did ban blacks from freshman dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome Karabel|title=The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|page=23|isbn=978-0-618-77355-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinberg|first1=Stephen|title=How Jewish Quotas Began|journal=Commentary|date=September 1, 1971|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-jewish-quotas-began/|access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Dirk|title=YALE'S LIMIT ON JEWISH ENROLLMENT LASTED UNTIL EARLY 1960'S, BOOK SAYS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/nyregion/yale-s-limit-on-jewish-enrollment-lasted-until-early-1960-s-book-says.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 4, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lowell Tells Jews Limits at Colleges Might Help Them|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/06/17/109843455.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 17, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[James B. Conant]] reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty to make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as at the college level. The resulting ''Report'', published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in 20th century American education.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Fay Kravitz, "The Harvard Report of 1945: An historical ethnography", Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1994, 367 pages; AAT 9427558&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1945 and 1960, admissions were opened up to bring in a more diverse group of students. No longer drawing mostly from select New England [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the [[Harvard College|undergraduate college]] became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics, or Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Malka A. Older. (1996). [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=217911 Preparatory schools and the admissions process]. [[The Harvard Crimson]], January 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the rest of the 20th century, Harvard became more diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Alvin|title=An update on Harvard's diversity, inclusion efforts|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/10/an-update-on-harvards-diversity-and-inclusion-efforts/|newspaper=The Harvard Gazette|date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at [[Radcliffe College]] (which since 1879 had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sally|last=Schwager|chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe|title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History|editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich|location=New York|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=1-4039-6098-4|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Women were first admitted to the [[Harvard Medical School|medical school]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945"&gt;{{cite report |title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945 |publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library |url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 |access-date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1971, Harvard has controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women. In 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Radcliffe Enters Historic Merger With Harvard |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/21/radcliffe-enters-historic-merger-with-harvard |access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard has the largest [[List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment|university endowment]] in the world, valued at about $41.9&amp;nbsp;billion as of 2020.&lt;ref name="Endowment"/&gt;
During the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007–2009]], it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=February 10, 2011 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/3/5/residents-protest-vacancies-in-allston-span/|date=March 5, 2009|title=Residents Protest Vacancies in Allston|newspaper=Harvard Crimson |author=Vidya B.

{{See also|Financial endowment#Criticism and reforms}}

Since the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated [[divestment|divesting]] Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]] during the [[Darfur genocide]], and the [[tobacco industry|tobacco]], [[fossil fuel]], and [[private prison]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Alli Welton|title=Harvard Students Vote 72 Percent Support for Fossil Fuel Divestment|magazine=The Nation|date=November 20, 2012|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/harvard-students-vote-72-percent-support-fossil-fuel-divestment/|access-date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexandra A.|last=Chaidez|title=Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign Delivers Report to Mass.

In the late 1980s, during the [[divestment from South Africa]] movement, student activists erected a symbolic "shantytown" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.&lt;ref name="GeorgeKaufman2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michael C.

The perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege, has made it a frequent literary and cinematic backdrop. "In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness," film critic Paul Sherman has said.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Sarah |title='Social Network' taps other campuses for Harvard role |website=Boston.com |date=September 24, 2010 |url=https://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/09/harvard_at_the_movies_schools.html |quote='In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness.... Someone from Missouri who has never lived in Boston ... can get this idea that it's all trust fund babies and ivy-covered walls.' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Harvard's policy since 1970 (after the damage caused by ''Love Story'') has been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.&lt;ref name="HFilm"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nathaniel L. |last=Schwartz |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/9/21/university-hollywood-relationship-not-always-a/ |title=University, Hollywood Relationship Not Always a 'Love Story' |newspaper=Harvard Crimson |date=September 21, 1999 |access-date=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/09/harvard_at_the_movies_schools.html|title='Social Network' taps other campuses for Harvard role| author=Sarah Thomas|date=  September 24, 2010 |website=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
