The [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), located inside the dome capped cylindrical structure, is dwarfed in size by its [[cooling tower]]. The station produces a yearly average of 25 million [[kilowatt-hour]]s per day, sufficient to power a city the size of [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://home.olemiss.edu/~cmchengs/Global%20Warming/Session%2017%20Nuclear%20Energy%20-%20Statistics/Nuclear%20Energy.pdf | title= Nuclear Energy: Statistics | author= Dr. Elizabeth Ervin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Nuclear power''' is the use of [[nuclear reaction]]s to produce [[electricity]]. Nuclear power can be obtained from [[nuclear fission]], [[nuclear decay]] and [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] in [[nuclear power plant]]s. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s in some space probes such as [[Voyager 2]]. Generating electricity from [[fusion power]] remains the focus of international research. 

Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,586 [[terawatt hour]]s (TWh) of electricity in 2019, equivalent to about 10% of [[global electricity generation]], and was the second-largest [[low-carbon power]] source after [[hydroelectricity]]. {{As of|2021|1|post=,}} there are [[List of nuclear reactors|442 civilian fission reactors in the world]], with a combined electrical capacity of 392 [[gigawatt]] (GW). There are also 53 nuclear power reactors under construction and 98 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 60&amp;nbsp;GW and 103&amp;nbsp;GW, respectively. The [[United States]] has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors, generating over 800 TWh zero-emissions electricity per year with an average [[capacity factor]] of 92%. Most reactors under construction are [[generation III reactor]]s in Asia.

Nuclear power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources.&lt;!--nuclear accidents are fewer but may cause more severe damage. ines 7 nuclear accidents are widely known and have left a long-lasting impact on the surrounding environment and are thus used by anti-nuclear power activists as evidence of the inherent danger of traditional, generation 2 fission reactor nuclear power. generation 3 fission reactors have been designed to have a much higher level of safety, incorporating passive nuclear safety, to theoretically reduce the possibility of an accident.--&gt; [[Coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and hydroelectricity each have caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to [[air pollution]] and [[Energy accidents|accidents]]. Since its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented about 1.84 million [[air pollution]]-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.
[[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|Accidents in nuclear power plants]] include the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1986, the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in [[Japan]] in 2011, and the more contained [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States in 1979.

There is a [[Nuclear power debate|debate about nuclear power]]. Proponents, such as the [[World Nuclear Association]] and [[Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]], contend that nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source that reduces [[carbon emissions]]. [[Anti-nuclear movement|Nuclear power opponents]], such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service|NIRS]], contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.

==History==
{{main|History of nuclear power}}

===Origins===
[[File:First four nuclear lit bulbs.jpeg|thumb|The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at [[EBR-1]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]-West, December 20, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reactors: Modern-Day Alchemy - Argonne's Nuclear Science and Technology Legacy |url=https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/modern-day-alchemy/ |website=www.ne.anl.gov |access-date=24 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The discovery of nuclear fission occurred in 1938 following over four decades of work on the science of [[radioactivity]] and the elaboration of new [[nuclear physics]] that described the components of [[atom]]s.
Soon after the discovery of the fission process, it was realized that a fissioning nucleus can induce further nucleus fissions, thus inducing a self-sustaining chain reaction.&lt;ref name="Inside the Atomic Patent Office"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2968/064002008 | volume=64 | issue=2 | title=Inside the atomic patent office | year=2008 | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | pages=26–31 | last1 = Wellerstein | first1 = Alex| bibcode=2008BuAtS..64b..26W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once this was experimentally confirmed in 1939, scientists in many countries petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of [[World War II]], for the development of a [[nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/mp/introduction.shtml |title=The Einstein Letter |publisher=Atomicarchive.com |access-date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, these research efforts led to the creation of the first man-made nuclear reactor, the [[Chicago Pile-1]], which achieved [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] on December 2, 1942. The reactor's development was part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to create [[atomic bombs]] during World War II. It led to the building of larger single-purpose [[production reactor]]s for the production of [[weapons-grade plutonium]] for use in the first nuclear weapons. The United States tested the first nuclear weapon in July 1945, the [[Trinity test]], with the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] taking place one month later.

[[File:Nautiluscore.jpg|thumb| The launching ceremony of the {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} January 1954. In 1958 it would become the first vessel to reach the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nautilus (SSN-571) |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/ships/uss-nautilus.html |publisher=US Naval History and Heritage Command (US Navy)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:HD.15.019 (11823864155).jpg|thumb|The [[Calder Hall nuclear power station]] in the United Kingdom, the world's first commercial nuclear power station.]]
Despite the military nature of the first nuclear devices, the 1940s and 1950s were characterized by strong optimism for the potential of nuclear power to provide cheap and endless energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wendt |first1=Gerald |last2=Geddes |first2=Donald Porter |title=The Atomic Age Opens |date=1945 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |url=http://alsos.wlu.edu/information.aspx?id=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the [[EBR-I]] experimental station near [[Arco, Idaho]], which initially produced about 100&amp;nbsp;[[kW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/frt.shtml |title=Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Fast Reactor Technology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |access-date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;pg=PA105 |title=Reactor Makes Electricity |magazine=Popular Mechanics |date= March 1952| page= 105|publisher=Hearst Magazines }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1953, American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] gave his "[[Atoms for Peace]]" speech at the [[United Nations]], emphasizing the need to develop "peaceful" uses of nuclear power quickly. This was followed by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] which allowed rapid declassification of U.S. reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector.

===First power generation===
The first organization to develop practical nuclear power was the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], with the [[S1W reactor]] for the purpose of propelling [[submarine]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. The first nuclear-powered submarine, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, was put to sea in January 1954.&lt;ref name="iaeapdf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/lwr3.shtml#fragment-2 |title=STR (Submarine Thermal Reactor) in "Reactors Designed by Argonne National Laboratory: Light Water Reactor Technology Development" |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory |year=2012 |access-date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[S1W reactor]] was a [[Pressurized Water Reactor]]. This design was chosen because it was simpler, more compact, and easier to operate compared to alternative designs, thus more suitable to be used in submarines. This decision would result in the PWR being the reactor of choice also for power generation, thus having a lasting impact on the civilian electricity market in the years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rockwell|first=Theodore|title=The Rickover Effect|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1992|pages=162|isbn=978-1-55750-702-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 1954, the [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] in the [[USSR]] became the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a [[power grid]], producing around 5 megawatts of electric power.&lt;ref name="IAEANews"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2004/obninsk.html |title=From Obninsk Beyond: Nuclear Power Conference Looks to Future |website=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] | access-date = 2006-06-27|date=2004-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The world's first commercial nuclear power station, [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] at Windscale, England was connected to the national power grid on 27 August 1956. In common with a number of other [[generation I reactor]]s, the plant had the dual purpose of producing [[electricity]] and [[plutonium-239]], the latter for the nascent [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapons program in Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=C. N. |title=An atomic empire : a technical history of the rise and fall of the British atomic energy programme |date=2013 |publisher=Imperial College Press |location=London |isbn=9781908977434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major accident at a nuclear reactor occurred in 1961 at the [[SL-1]], a [[U.S. Army]] experimental nuclear power reactor at the [[Idaho National Laboratory]]. An uncontrolled chain reaction resulted in a [[steam explosion]] which killed the three crew members and caused a [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].&lt;ref name=ido19313&gt;''[http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf IDO-19313: Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065809/http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }} Final Report of Progress July through October 1962'', November 21, 1962, Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeown |first=William |title=Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America's First Nuclear Accident |isbn=978-1-55022-562-4 |year=2003 |publisher=ECW Press |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another serious accident happened in 1968, when one of the two [[liquid-metal-cooled reactor]]s on board the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27}} underwent a [[fuel element failure]], with the emission of gaseous [[fission product]]s into the surrounding air, resulting in 9 crew fatalities and 83 injuries.&lt;ref name=johnston2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/radevents1.html |title=Deadliest radiation accidents and other events causing radiation casualties |author=Johnston, Robert |date=2007-09-23 |publisher=Database of Radiological Incidents and Related Events }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion and first opposition===
The total global installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly, rising from less than 1 [[gigawatt]] (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="iaeapdf"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC48/Documents/gc48inf-4_ftn3.pdf |title=50 Years of Nuclear Energy |access-date=2006-11-09 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs (related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation)&lt;ref name="Bernard L. Cohen 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernard L. Cohen |date=1990 |title=The Nuclear Energy Option: An Alternative for the 90s |url=https://archive.org/details/nuclearenergyopt0000cohe |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-43567-6 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive. In the 1980s in the U.S. and 1990s in Europe, the flat electric grid growth and [[electricity liberalization]] also made the addition of large new [[baseload]] energy generators economically unattractive.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] had a significant effect on countries, such as [[France]] and [[Japan]], which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation to invest in nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sharon Beder| url=http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/privatisation/japan.html |title=The Japanese Situation, English version of conclusion of Sharon Beder, "Power Play: The Fight to Control the World's Electricity"|publisher= Soshisha, Japan|date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
France would construct 25 nuclear power plants over the next 15 years,&lt;ref name="palfreman"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Palfreman| first = Jon| title = Why the French Like Nuclear Energy| work = [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| access-date = 25 August 2007| year = 1997| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/readings/french.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de preneuf"&gt;{{cite web| last = Rene de Preneuf| title = Nuclear Power in France&amp;nbsp;– Why does it Work? | access-date = 25 August 2007| url = http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol13_2/npfr_.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813233335/http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol13_2/npfr_.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2019, 71% of French electricity was generated by nuclear power, the highest percentage by any nation in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the United States in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=well&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garb Paula | title = Review of Critical Masses : Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958-1978 | url = http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm | journal = Journal of Political Ecology | volume = 6 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express pointed concerns.&lt;ref name=wolfgang /&gt; These [[anti-nuclear]] concerns related to [[nuclear accidents]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[nuclear terrorism]] and [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]]| url= http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/07sa.html | title=Opposing nuclear power: past and present| journal= Social Alternatives| volume= 26| number=2| date=2007|pages= 43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in [[Wyhl]], Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 the anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of [[Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stephen Mills |author2=Roger Williams |title=Public acceptance of new technologies : an international review |date=1986 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=London |isbn=9780709943198 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeMNAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=%22public+acceptance+of+new+technologies%22 |pages=375–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=got&gt;Robert Gottlieb (2005).

By the mid-1970s [[anti-nuclear]] activism gained a wider appeal and influence, and nuclear power began to become an issue of major public protest.&lt;ref name=jimfalk&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Jim |date=1982|title=Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power |url=https://archive.org/details/globalfissionbat00falk |url-access=registration |location = Melbourne |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/globalfissionbat00falk/page/95 95–96] |isbn=978-0-19-554315-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;Walker, J.

During the 1980s one new nuclear reactor started up every 17&amp;nbsp;days on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorpe, M.S. |first1=Gary S. |title=AP Environmental Science, 6th ed. |date=2015 |publisher=Barrons Educational Series |isbn=978-1-4380-6728-5}} {{ISBN|1-4380-6728-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, global installed nuclear capacity reached 300 GW. Since the late 1980s, new capacity additions slowed down significantly, with the installed nuclear capacity reaching 366 GW in 2005.

The 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the [[USSR]], involving an [[RBMK]] reactor, altered the development of nuclear power and led to a greater focus on meeting international safety and regulatory standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl|title=Chernobyl Nuclear Accident|date=14 May 2014|website=www.iaea.org | publisher=IAEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in total casualties, with 56 direct deaths, and financially, with the cleanup and the cost estimated at 18&amp;nbsp;billion [[Soviet ruble]]s (US$68&amp;nbsp;billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf|title=Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter II – The release, dispersion and deposition of radionuclides|year=2002|publisher=OECD-NEA|access-date=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622010856/https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf|archive-date=22 June 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GorbachevBoC"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Johnson, Thomas (author/director) |date=2006 |title=The battle of Chernobyl |url=https://www.andanafilms.com/catalogueFiche.php?idFiche=255&amp;rub=Toutes%20les%20fiches%20films |publisher=Play Film / Discovery Channel}} (see 1996 interview with Mikhail Gorbachev)&lt;/ref&gt; The international organization to promote safety awareness and the professional development of operators in nuclear facilities, the [[World Association of Nuclear Operators]] (WANO), was created as a direct outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl accident.
The Chernobyl disaster played a major part in the reduction in the number of new plant constructions in the following years.&lt;ref name=wolfgang/&gt; Influenced by these events, Italy voted against nuclear power in a 1987 referendum, becoming the first country to completely phase out nuclear power in 1990.

In the early 2000s, nuclear energy was expecting a [[nuclear renaissance]], an increase in the construction of new reactors, due to concerns about [[carbon dioxide emissions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
During this period, newer [[generation III reactor]]s, such as the [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]] began construction, although encountering problems and delays, and going significantly over budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Areva's Finland reactor to start in 2019 after another delay |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-nuclear-olkiluoto/arevas-finland-reactor-to-start-in-2019-after-another-delay-idUSKBN1CE1ND |access-date=3 August 2019 |work=Reuters |date=9 October 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Nuclear power plant|Nuclear reactor}}
{{See also|List of nuclear reactors|List of nuclear power stations}}
Nuclear power plants are [[thermal power station]]s that generate electricity by harnessing the [[thermal energy]] released from [[nuclear fission]].
A fission nuclear power plant is generally composed of a [[nuclear reactor]], in which the nuclear reactions generating heat take place; a cooling system, which removes the heat from inside the reactor; a [[steam turbine]], which transforms the heat into [[mechanical energy]]; an [[electric generator]], which transforms the mechanical energy into electrical energy.&lt;ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics /&gt;

When a [[neutron]] hits the nucleus of a [[uranium-235]] or [[plutonium]] atom, it can split the nucleus into two smaller nuclei. The reaction is called nuclear fission. The fission reaction releases energy and neutrons. The released neutrons can hit other uranium or plutonium nuclei, causing new fission reactions, which release more energy and more neutrons. This is called a [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]]. 
In most commercial reactors, the reaction rate is controlled by [[control rod]]s that absorb excess neutrons. 
The controllability of nuclear reactors depends on the fact that a small fraction of neutrons resulting from fission are [[Delayed neutron|delayed]]. The time delay between the fission and the release of the neutrons slows down changes in reaction rates and gives time for moving the control rods to adjust the reaction rate.&lt;ref name=WNAnuclearreactorbasics&gt;{{cite web |title=How does a nuclear reactor make electricity? |publisher= World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/how-does-a-nuclear-reactor-make-electricity.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |access-date=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atomic-age-began-75-years-ago-with-the-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction/|title=Atomic age began 75 years ago with the first controlled nuclear chain reaction|last1=Spyrou|first1=Artemis|date=2017-12-03|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-18|last2=Mittig|first2=Wolfgang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle of nuclear fuel ==
[[File:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|thumb|The nuclear fuel cycle begins when uranium is mined, enriched, and manufactured into nuclear fuel (1), which is delivered to a [[nuclear power plant]]. After use, the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (2) or to a final repository (3). In [[nuclear reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to use in a power plant (4).]]

{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle|Integrated Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System}}

The life cycle of nuclear fuel starts with [[uranium mining]]. The [[uranium ore]] is then converted into a compact [[ore concentrate]] form, known as [[yellowcake]] (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), to facilitate transport.&lt;ref name="nrc_fuel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stages of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |url=https://www.nrc.gov/materials/fuel-cycle-fac/stages-fuel-cycle.html |website=NRC Web |publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |access-date=17 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fission reactors generally need [[uranium-235]], a [[fissile material|fissile]] [[isotopes of uranium|isotope of uranium]]. 
The concentration of uranium-235 in natural uranium is very low (about 0.7%). Some reactors can use this natural uranium as fuel, depending on their [[neutron economy]]. These reactors generally have graphite or [[heavy water]] moderators. 
For light water reactors, the most common type of reactor, this concentration is too low, and it must be increased by a process called [[uranium enrichment]].&lt;ref name="nrc_fuel"/&gt; In civilian light water reactors, uranium is typically enriched to 3.5-5% uranium-235.&lt;ref name="wna_fuel"/&gt;
The uranium is then generally converted into [[uranium oxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a ceramic, that is then compressively [[sintered]] into fuel pellets, a stack of which forms [[fuel rod]]s of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor.&lt;ref name="wna_fuel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Fuel Cycle Overview |url=https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/introduction/nuclear-fuel-cycle-overview.aspx |website=www.world-nuclear.org |publisher=World Nuclear Association |access-date=17 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some time in the reactor, the fuel will have reduced fissile material and increased fission products, until its use becomes impractical.&lt;ref name="wna_fuel"/&gt; At this point, the spent fuel will be moved to a [[spent fuel pool]] which provides cooling for the thermal heat and shielding for ionizing radiation. After several months or years, the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.&lt;ref name="wna_fuel"/&gt;

=== Uranium resources ===

[[Uranium]] is a fairly common [[chemical element|element]] in the Earth's crust: it is approximately as common as [[tin]] or [[germanium]], and is about 40&amp;nbsp;times more common than [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/uranium.aspx |title=uranium Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about uranium |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |date=2001-09-11 |access-date=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Uranium is present in trace concentrations in most rocks, dirt, and ocean water, but is generally economically extracted only where it is present in high concentrations. 
Uranium mining can be underground, [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]], or [[in-situ leach]] mining. An increasing number of the highest output mines are remote underground operations, such as [[McArthur River uranium mine]], in Canada, which by itself accounts for 13% of global production.

Light water reactors make relatively inefficient use of nuclear fuel, mostly using only the very rare uranium-235 isotope.&lt;ref name="wna-wmitnfc"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf04.html |title=Waste Management in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |access-date=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |website=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear reprocessing]] can make this waste reusable, and newer reactors also achieve a more efficient use of the available resources than older ones.&lt;ref name="wna-wmitnfc"/&gt; With a pure [[fast reactor]] fuel cycle with a burn up of all the uranium and [[actinide]]s (which presently make up the most hazardous substances in nuclear waste), there is an estimated 160,000 years worth of Uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ore at the price of 60–100 US$/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter4.pdf |title=Energy Supply |page=271 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215202932/http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter4.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-15}} and figure 4.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unconventional uranium resources also exist. Uranium is naturally present in seawater at a concentration of about 3 [[microgram]]s per liter,&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeEUcIRsIwAC&amp;q=Radium+and+thorium+isotopes+in+the+surface+waters+of+the+East+Pacific+and+coastal+southern+California.+Earth+Planet.+Sci.+Lett.,+39:+235249.&amp;pg=PA598 |page=399|title=Isotopes of the Earth's Hydrosphere|isbn=978-94-007-2856-1|last1=Ferronsky|first1=V.I.|last2=Polyakov|first2=V.A.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp147.pdf |title=Toxicological profile for thorium |year=1990 |publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |page=76 |quote=world average concentration in seawater is 0.05 μg/L (Harmsen and De Haan 1980)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/ac00288a030|title = Determination of thorium concentration in seawater by neutron activation analysis|journal = Analytical Chemistry|volume = 57|issue = 11|pages = 2138–2142|year = 2002|last1 = Huh|first1 = C.A.|last2 = Bacon|first2 = M.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 4.4 billion tons of uranium considered present in seawater at any time.&lt;ref name="gepr.org" /&gt;

Over geological timescales, uranium extracted on an industrial scale from seawater would be replenished by both river erosion of rocks and the natural process of uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|dissolved]] from the surface area of the ocean floor, both of which maintain the [[Solubility equilibrium|solubility equilibria]] of seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater – Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas |first=Noriaki|last=Seko| publisher=Global Energy Policy Research |date=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal operation of nuclear power plants and facilities produce [[radioactive waste]], or nuclear waste. This type of waste is also produced during plant decommissioning. There are two broad categories of nuclear waste: low-level waste and high-level waste.&lt;ref name=nrc_waste/&gt; The first has low radioactivity and includes contaminated items such as clothing, which poses limited threat. High-level waste is mainly the spent fuel from nuclear reactors, which is very radioactive and must be cooled and then safely disposed of or reprocessed.&lt;ref name=nrc_waste&gt;{{cite web |title=Backgrounder on Radioactive Waste |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/radwaste.html |website=NRC |publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |access-date=20 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important waste stream from nuclear power reactors is [[spent nuclear fuel]], which is considered [[high-level waste]].
For LWRs, spent fuel is typically composed of 95% uranium, 4% [[fission product]]s, and about 1% [[transuranic]] [[actinides]] (mostly [[plutonium]], [[neptunium]] and [[americium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radioactivity : Minor Actinides |url=http://www.radioactivity.eu.com/site/pages/Minor_Actinides.htm |website=www.radioactivity.eu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plutonium and other transuranics are responsible for the bulk of the long-term radioactivity, whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short-term radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ojovan |first1=Michael I. |title=An introduction to nuclear waste immobilisation, second edition |date=2014 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Kidlington, Oxford, U.K. |isbn=978-0-08-099392-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-level waste requires treatment, management, and isolation from the environment. 
These operations present considerable challenges due to the extremely long periods these materials remain potentially hazardous to living organisms. 
This is due to [[long-lived fission product]]s (LLFP), such as [[technetium-99]] (half-life 220,000 years) and [[iodine-129]] (half-life 15.7 million years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |title=Environmental Surveillance, Education and Research Program |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041307/http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |archive-date=2008-11-21 |access-date=2009-01-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
LLFP dominate the waste stream in terms of radioactivity, after the more intensely radioactive short-lived [[fission products]] (SLFPs) have decayed into stable elements, which takes approximately 300 years.&lt;ref name="jaif"/&gt; After about 500 years, the waste becomes less radioactive than natural uranium ore.&lt;ref name=mccarthy_stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/nuclear-faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Nuclear Energy| author=John McCarthy |quote=after 500 years, the fission products will be less radioactive than the uranium ore they are originally derived from}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commonly suggested methods to isolate LLFP waste from the [[biosphere]] include separation and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]],&lt;ref name="jaif"/&gt; [[synroc]] treatments, or deep geological storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ojovan, M.I. |author2=Lee, W.E. |title=An Introduction to Nuclear Waste Immobilisation|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|location=Amsterdam|page=315|year=2005|isbn=978-0-08-044462-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technical Bases for Yucca Mountain Standards |author=National Research Council |year=1995 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-05289-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DLyAtgVPy0C&amp;pg=PA91|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/2006/january/article1.html |title=The Status of Nuclear Waste Disposal |date=January 2006 |publisher=The American Physical Society |access-date=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/yucca/70fr49013.pdf |title=Public Health and Environmental Radiation Protection Standards for Yucca Mountain, Nevada; Proposed Rule |date=2005-08-22| publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermal-neutron reactor]]s, which presently constitute the majority of the world fleet, cannot burn up the [[reactor grade plutonium]] that is generated during the reactor operation. This limits the life of nuclear fuel to a few years. 
In some countries, such as the United States, spent fuel is classified in its entirety as a nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32163.pdf |title=CRS Report for Congress. Radioactive Waste Streams: Waste Classification for Disposal |quote=The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) defined irradiated fuel as spent nuclear fuel, and the byproducts as high-level waste.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other countries, such as France, it is largely reprocessed to produce a partially recycled fuel, known as mixed oxide fuel or [[MOX]]. For spent fuel that does not undergo reprocessing, the most concerning isotopes are the medium-lived [[transuranic element]]s, which are led by reactor-grade plutonium (half-life 24,000 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenbosch|2007|p=21.|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some proposed reactor designs, such as the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] and [[molten salt reactor]]s, can use as fuel the plutonium and other actinides in spent fuel from light water reactors, thanks to their [[fast fission]] spectrum. This offers a potentially more attractive alternative to deep geological disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Duncan Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/09/nuclear-waste-burning-reactor |title=Nuclear waste-burning reactor moves a step closer to reality &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |date=2012-07-09 |access-date=2013-06-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/12/05/a-waste-of-waste/ |author=George Monbiot |title= A Waste of Waste |publisher=Monbiot.com |access-date=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZR0UKxNPh8 |title=Energy From Thorium: A Nuclear Waste Burning Liquid Salt Thorium Reactor |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-23 |access-date=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[thorium fuel cycle]] results in similar fission products, though creates a much smaller proportion of transuranic elements from [[neutron capture]] events within a reactor. Spent thorium fuel, although more difficult to handle than spent uranium fuel, may present somewhat lower proliferation risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Role of Thorium to Supplement Fuel Cycles of Future Nuclear Energy Systems |url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1540_web.pdf |publisher=IAEA |access-date=7 April 2021 |date=2012 |quote=Once irradiated in a reactor, the fuel of a thorium–uranium cycle contains an admixture of 232U (half-life 68.9 years) whose radioactive decay chain includes emitters (particularly 208Tl) of high energy gamma radiation (2.6 MeV).

==== Low-level waste ====
{{main|Low-level waste}}

The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of [[low-level waste]], with low radioactivity, in the form of contaminated items like clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the materials of which the reactor itself is built. Low-level waste can be stored on-site until radiation levels are low enough to be disposed of as ordinary waste, or it can be sent to a low-level waste disposal site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NRC: Low-Level Waste |url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/low-level-waste.html |website=www.nrc.gov |access-date=28 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Waste relative to other types ====
{{See also|Radioactive waste#Naturally occurring radioactive material}}
In countries with nuclear power, radioactive wastes account for less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, much of which remains hazardous for long periods.&lt;ref name="wna-wmitnfc" /&gt; Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/TheRisksOfNuclearPower|title=The Challenges of Nuclear Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal-burning plants, in particular, produce large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash resulting from the concentration of [[naturally occurring radioactive material]]s in coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2007-12-13 |title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste |journal=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2008 report from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population [[effective dose equivalent]] from radiation from coal plants is 100 times that from the operation of nuclear plants.&lt;ref name="colmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger |author=Alex Gabbard |date=2008-02-05 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |access-date=2008-01-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archive-date=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel by weight, coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated. It is also released directly into the environment as [[fly ash]], whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials.&lt;ref name="cejournal"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2008-12-31 |title=Coal ash is ''not'' more radioactive than nuclear waste |url= http://www.cejournal.net/?p=410 |journal=CE Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827045039/http://www.cejournal.net/?p=410 |archive-date=2009-08-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear waste volume is small compared to the energy produced. For example, at [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station]], which generated 44 billion [[kilowatt hours]] of electricity when in service, its complete spent fuel inventory is contained within sixteen casks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yankeerowe.com/ |title=Yankee Nuclear Power Plant |publisher=Yankeerowe.com |access-date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that to produce a lifetime supply of energy for a person at a western [[standard of living]] (approximately 3 [[GWh]]) would require on the order of the volume of a [[soda can]] of [[low enriched uranium]], resulting in a similar volume of spent fuel generated.&lt;ref name="Generation Atomic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.generationatomic.org/why-nuclear |title=Why nuclear energy|work=Generation Atomic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125740818 |title=NPR Nuclear Waste May Get A Second Life| work=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/TommyZhou.shtml |title=Hyperphysics ''Energy Consumption of the United States''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Waste disposal ====
{{See also|List of radioactive waste treatment technologies}}
[[File:WIPP-04.jpeg|alt=Storage of radioactive waste at WIPP|thumb|[[nuclear flask|Nuclear waste flasks]] generated by the United States during the Cold War are stored underground at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] (WIPP) in [[New Mexico]]. The facility is seen as a potential demonstration for storing spent fuel from civilian reactors.]]
Following interim storage in a [[spent fuel pool]], the bundles of used fuel rod assemblies of a typical nuclear power station are often stored on site in [[dry cask storage]] vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/dry-cask-storage.html |title=NRC: Dry Cask Storage |publisher=Nrc.gov |date=2013-03-26 |access-date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Presently, waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate.

Disposal of nuclear waste is often considered the most politically divisive aspect in the lifecycle of a nuclear power facility.&lt;ref name=mont2011&gt;Montgomery, Scott L. (2010). ''The Powers That Be'', University of Chicago Press, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reprocessing ===
{{main|Nuclear reprocessing}}
{{see also|Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement}}

Most [[thermal-neutron reactor]]s run on a [[once-through nuclear fuel cycle]], mainly due to the low price of fresh uranium. 
However, many reactors are also fueled with recycled fissionable materials that remain in spent nuclear fuel. The most common fissionable material that is recycled is the [[reactor-grade plutonium]] (RGPu) that is extracted from spent fuel, it is mixed with uranium oxide and fabricated into mixed-oxide or [[MOX fuel]]. 
Because thermal LWRs remain the most common reactor worldwide, this type of recycling is the most common. It is considered to increase the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle, reduce the attractiveness of spent fuel to theft, and lower the volume of high level nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.069|title=Assessment of the environmental footprint of nuclear energy systems.

Spent MOX fuel cannot generally be recycled for use in thermal-neutron reactors. This issue does not affect [[fast-neutron reactor]]s, which are therefore preferred in order to achieve the full energy potential of the original uranium.&lt;ref name="berrytoll" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Spectrum"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fairley|first1=Peter|title=Nuclear Wasteland|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/feb07/4891|work=IEEE Spectrum|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main constituent of spent fuel from LWRs is slightly [[enriched uranium]]. This can be recycled into [[reprocessed uranium]] (RepU), which can be used in a fast reactor, used directly as fuel in [[CANDU]] reactors, or re-enriched for another cycle through an LWR. 
Re-enriching of reprocessed uranium is common in France and Russia.&lt;ref name="WNA3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel.aspx |title=Processing of Used Nuclear Fuel |date=2018 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |access-date=2018-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reprocessed uranium is also safer in terms of nuclear proliferation potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document| url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6743129-proliferation-resistant-nuclear-fuel-cycles-spiking-plutonium-sup-pu |title=Proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycles. &amp;#91;Spiking of plutonium with /sup 238/Pu&amp;#93;|osti=6743129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Formation of proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel supplies based on reprocessed uranium for Russian nuclear technologies recipient countries|journal= Nuclear Energy and Technology|volume= 1|issue= 2|pages= 111–116|doi= 10.1016/j.nucet.2015.11.023|year= 2015|last1= Fedorov|first1= M.I.|last2= Dyachenko|first2= A.I.|last3= Balagurov|first3= N.A.|last4= Artisyuk|first4= V.V.|doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proliferation resistant plutonium: An updated analysis|journal=Nuclear Engineering and Design|volume=330|pages=297–302|doi=10.1016/j.nucengdes.2018.02.012|year=2018|last1=Lloyd|first1=Cody|last2=Goddard|first2=Braden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reprocessing has the potential to recover up to 95% of the uranium and plutonium fuel in spent nuclear fuel, as well as reduce long-term radioactivity within the remaining waste. 
However, reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential for [[nuclear proliferation]] and varied perceptions of increasing the vulnerability to [[nuclear terrorism]].&lt;ref name=berrytoll/&gt;&lt;ref name=bas2011/&gt; Reprocessing also leads to higher fuel cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle.&lt;ref name=berrytoll&gt;R. Stephen Berry and George S. Tolley, [http://franke.uchicago.edu/energy2013/group6.pdf Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing], The University of Chicago, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bas2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/managing-nuclear-spent-fuel-policy-lessons-10-country-study|title=Managing nuclear spent fuel: Policy lessons from a 10-country study|author=Harold Feiveson|year=2011|website=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste, it does not reduce the [[fission product]]s that are the primary causes of residual heat generation and radioactivity for the first few centuries outside the reactor. Thus, reprocessed waste still requires an almost identical treatment for the initial first few hundred years.

Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, and India. In the United States, spent nuclear fuel is currently not reprocessed.&lt;ref name="WNA3" /&gt; 
The [[La Hague site|La Hague reprocessing facility]] in France has operated commercially since 1976 and is responsible for half the world's reprocessing as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kok|first=Kenneth D.|title=Nuclear Engineering Handbook|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|page=332|isbn=978-1-4200-5391-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMy2OyUrqbUC&amp;pg=PA332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces MOX fuel from spent fuel derived from several countries.

=== Breeding ===
[[File:Nuclear-Fuel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nuclear fuel]] assemblies being inspected before entering a [[pressurized water reactor]] in the United States.]]
{{Main|Breeder reactor|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy}}
Breeding is the process of converting non-fissile material into fissile material that can be used as nuclear fuel. The non-fissile material that can be used for this process is called [[fertile material]], and constitute the vast majority of current nuclear waste. 
This breeding process occurs naturally in [[breeder reactor]]s. As opposed to light water thermal-neutron reactors, which use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast-neutron breeder reactors use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium) or thorium.

[[File:Ikata Nuclear Powerplant.JPG|thumb|The [[Ikata Nuclear Power Plant]], a [[pressurized water reactor]] that cools by utilizing a secondary coolant [[heat exchanger]] with a large body of water, an alternative cooling approach to large [[cooling towers]].]]
The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments depend on the choice of an energy source.
Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs.
For this reason, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants.
The high cost of construction is one of the biggest challenges for nuclear power plants. A new 1,100 MW plant is estimated to cost between $6 billion to $9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Synapse Energy {{!}}|url=https://www.synapse-energy.com/|access-date=2020-12-29|website=www.synapse-energy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nuclear power cost trends show large disparity by nation, design, build rate and the establishment of familiarity in expertise. The only two nations for which data is available that saw cost decreases in the 2000s were India and South Korea.&lt;ref name=Lovering2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.01.011 |title=Historical construction costs of global nuclear power reactors |journal=Energy Policy |volume=91 |pages=371–382 |year=2016 |last1=Lovering |first1=Jessica R. |last2=Yip |first2=Arthur |last3=Nordhaus |first3=Ted |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must also take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties.
As of 2010, all operating nuclear power plants have been developed by state-owned or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[electric utility]] monopolies.&lt;ref name=ft-20100912&gt;{{cite news |author=Ed Crooks |date=2010-09-12 |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |access-date=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many countries have since liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=MIT-2003&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-615-12420-9 |access-date=2006-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[levelized cost of electricity]] from a new nuclear power plant is estimated to be 69&amp;nbsp;USD/MWh, according to an analysis by the [[International Energy Agency]] and the [[OECD]] [[Nuclear Energy Agency]]. This represents the median cost estimate for an nth-of-a-kind nuclear power plant to be completed in 2025, at a [[Discounting|discount rate]] of 7%. Nuclear power was found to be the least-cost option among [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable technologies]].&lt;ref name="IEA_LCOE_2020"/&gt; [[Variable renewable energy|Variable renewables]] can generate cheaper electricity: the median cost of onshore wind power was estimated to be 50&amp;nbsp;USD/MWh, and utility-scale solar power 56 USD/MWh.&lt;ref name="IEA_LCOE_2020"/&gt;
At the assumed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission cost of USD&amp;nbsp;30 per ton, power from coal (88&amp;nbsp;USD/MWh) and gas (71&amp;nbsp;USD/MWh) is more expensive than low-carbon technologies.
Electricity from long-term operation of nuclear power plants by lifetime extension was found the be the least-cost option, at 32&amp;nbsp;USD/MWh.&lt;ref name="IEA_LCOE_2020"&gt;{{cite web |title=Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2020 |url=https://www.iea.org/reports/projected-costs-of-generating-electricity-2020 |publisher=International Energy Agency &amp; OECD Nuclear Energy Agency |access-date=12 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power |date=2009 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-update2009.pdf |access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Splitting the cost |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2009/11/12/splitting-the-cost |access-date=21 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=12 November 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[small modular reactors]], such as those developed by [[NuScale Power]], are aimed at reducing the investment costs for new construction by making the reactors smaller and modular, so that they can be built in a factory.

Certain designs had considerable early positive economics, such as the [[CANDU]], which realized much higher [[capacity factor]] and reliability when compared to generation II light water reactors up to the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm | title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section A: CANDU Technology | access-date=2019-08-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101054647/http://nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm | archive-date=2013-11-01 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power plants, though capable of some grid-[[load following]], are typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated electrical energy as low as possible, supplying mostly [[base-load]] electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/nea-news/2011/29-2/nea-news-29-2-load-following-e.pdf |title=Load-following with nuclear power plants |author= A.

Due to the on-line refueling reactor design, [[PHWR]]s (of which the CANDU design is a part) continue to hold many world record positions for longest continual electricity generation, often over 800 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Indian-reactor-breaks-operating-record |title = Indian reactor breaks operating record | work=World Nuclear News | date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Nuclear power in space}}
The most common use of nuclear power in space is the use of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which use [[radioactive decay]] to generate power.
These power generators are relatively small scale (few kW), and they are mostly used to power [[space mission]]s and experiments for long periods where solar power is not available in sufficient quantity, such as in the [[Voyager 2]] space probe.&lt;ref name=WNA_space/&gt;
A few space vehicles have been launched using [[nuclear reactor]]s: 34 reactors belong to the Soviet [[RORSAT]] series and one was the American [[SNAP-10A]].&lt;ref name=WNA_space&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Reactors for Space - World Nuclear Association |url=https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-reactors-for-space.aspx |website=world-nuclear.org |access-date=17 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and fusion appear promising for [[Spacecraft propulsion|space propulsion]] applications, generating higher mission velocities with less [[reaction mass]].&lt;ref name=WNA_space/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Patel |first1=Prachi |title=Nuclear-Powered Rockets Get a Second Look for Travel to Mars |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/nuclear-powered-rockets-get-a-second-look-for-travel-to-mars |access-date=17 April 2021 |work=IEEE Spectrum |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power plants have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to other power plants.
Firstly, intensely [[radioactive material]]s are present in a nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous.
Secondly, the [[fission product]]s, which make up most of the intensely radioactive substances in the reactor, continue to generate a significant amount of [[decay heat]] even after the fission [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] has stopped. If the heat cannot be removed from the reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive materials.
Thirdly, a [[criticality accident]] (a rapid increase of the reactor power) is possible in certain reactor designs if the chain reaction cannot be controlled.
These three characteristics have to be taken into account when designing nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name=IAEAsafety&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ansn.iaea.org/ansn.org/Common/Documents/apmd/asia251p4.pdf|title=Basic principles of nuclear safety|last=Deitrich|first=L.W.|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All modern reactors are designed so that an uncontrolled increase of the reactor power is prevented by natural feedback mechanisms, a concept known as negative [[void coefficient]] of reactivity. If the temperature or the amount of steam in the reactor increases, the fission rate inherently decreases. The chain reaction can also be manually stopped by inserting [[control rod]]s into the reactor core. [[Emergency core cooling system]]s (ECCS) can remove the decay heat from the reactor if normal cooling systems fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/emergency-core-cooling-systems-eccs.html|title=Emergency core cooling systems (ECCS)|date=2018-07-06|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=2018-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ECCS fails, multiple physical barriers limit the release of radioactive materials to the environment even in the case of an accident. The last physical barrier is the large [[containment building]].&lt;ref name="IAEAsafety" /&gt;

With a death rate of 0.07 per [[TWh]], nuclear power is the safest energy source per unit of energy generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What are the safest sources of energy?|url=https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2020-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and [[hydropower]] has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and [[energy accidents]].
This is found when comparing the immediate deaths from other energy sources to both the immediate and the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from nuclear [[energy accidents]].&lt;ref name="without the hot air"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c24/page_168.shtml |title=Dr. MacKay ''Sustainable Energy without the hot air'' |website= Data from studies by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] including non EU data |page= 168 |access-date=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theage2006"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/nuclear-power-cheaper-safer-than-coal-and-gas/2006/06/04/1149359609052.html | title= Nuclear power 'cheaper, safer' than coal and gas |author= Brendan Nicholson |date= 2006-06-05 |newspaper= [[The Age]] | access-date= 2008-01-18 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious impacts of nuclear accidents are often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects. Evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations created problems for many people, especially the elderly and hospital patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hasegawa |first1=Arifumi |last2=Tanigawa |first2=Koichi |last3=Ohtsuru |first3=Akira |last4=Yabe |first4=Hirooki |last5=Maeda |first5=Masaharu |last6=Shigemura |first6=Jun |last7=Ohira |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Tominaga |first8=Takako |last9=Akashi |first9=Makoto |last10=Hirohashi |first10=Nobuyuki |last11=Ishikawa |first11=Tetsuo |last12=Kamiya |first12=Kenji |last13=Shibuya |first13=Kenji |last14=Yamashita |first14=Shunichi |last15=Chhem |first15=Rethy K |title=Health effects of radiation and other health problems in the aftermath of nuclear accidents, with an emphasis on Fukushima |journal=The Lancet |date=August 2015 |volume=386 |issue=9992 |pages=479–488 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61106-0 |pmid=26251393 |s2cid=19289052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, and suicide.
A comprehensive 2005 study on the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster concluded that the mental health impact is the largest public health problem caused by the accident.&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew C.

Some serious [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|nuclear and radiation accidents]] have occurred.
The severity of nuclear accidents is generally classified using the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES) introduced by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).
The scale ranks anomalous events or accidents on a scale from 0 (a deviation from normal operation that poses no safety risk) to 7 (a major accident with widespread effects).
There have been 3 accidents of level 5 or higher in the civilian nuclear power industry, two of which, the [[Chernobyl accident]] and the [[Fukushima accident]], are ranked at level 7.

The Chernobyl accident in 1986 caused approximately 50 deaths from direct and indirect effects, and some temporary serious injuries from [[acute radiation syndrome]].&lt;ref name=WHO2012&gt;{{cite web|date=23 April 2011|title=Chernobyl at 25th anniversary – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=World Health Organisation|access-date=14 April 2012|url=https://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/20110423_FAQs_Chernobyl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The future predicted mortality from increases in cancer rates is estimated at about 4000 in the decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull383/boxp6.html |title=Assessing the Chernobyl Consequences |website=International Atomic Energy Agency |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830073635/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull383/boxp6.html |archive-date=30 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_2008_D&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/11-80076_Report_2008_Annex_D.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly, Annex D |website=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly |website=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident was caused by the [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami]].
The accident has not caused any radiation-related deaths but resulted in radioactive contamination of surrounding areas.
The difficult [[Fukushima disaster cleanup|cleanup operation]] is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars over 40 or more years.&lt;ref name="Richard Schiffman"&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Schiffman |date=2013-03-12 |title=Two years on, America hasn't learned lessons of Fukushima nuclear disaster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-accident-lessons-for-us |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Fackler"&gt;{{cite news |author=Martin Fackler |date=2011-06-01 |title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 was a smaller scale accident, rated at INES level 5.
There were no direct or indirect deaths caused by the accident.&lt;ref name="timenuke"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328130544/http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 28, 2009|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters|date=2009-03-25|access-date=2013-06-22|magazine=Time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of nuclear accidents is controversial. According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], fission [[energy accidents]] ranked first among energy sources in terms of their total economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sovacool | first1 = B.K. | title = The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2008.01.040 | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 1802–1820 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis found that coal, oil, [[liquid petroleum gas]] and hydroelectric accidents (primarily due to the [[Banqiao Dam disaster]]) have resulted in greater economic impacts than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burgherr |first1=Peter |last2=Hirschberg |first2=Stefan |title=A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains |journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment |date=10 October 2008 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=947–973 |doi=10.1080/10807030802387556 |s2cid=110522982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study compares latent cancer deaths attributable to nuclear with immediate deaths from other energy sources per unit of energy generated, and does not include fossil fuel related cancer and other indirect deaths created by the use of fossil fuel consumption in its "severe accident" (an accident with more than 5 fatalities) classification.

Nuclear power works under an [[insurance]] framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with national and international conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Conventions/liability.html |title=Publications: Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage|publisher= [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity. This cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the [[levelized cost of electricity]], according to a study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/05-02-nuclear.pdf |title=Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity|publisher= [[Congressional Budget Office]]|date= May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These beyond-regular insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power. [[Hydroelectric power]] plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as [[dam failure]]s. For example, the failure of the [[Banqiao Dam]] caused the death of an estimated 30,000 to 200,000 people, and 11 million people lost their homes. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.damsafety.org/media/Documents/FEMA/AvailabilityOfDamInsurance.pdf |title=Availability of Dam Insurance |date=1999}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108185336/http://www.damsafety.org/media/documents/fema/availabilityofdaminsurance.pdf|date=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks and sabotage ===
{{Main|Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack|Nuclear terrorism|Nuclear safety in the United States}}
Terrorists could target [[nuclear power plant]]s in an attempt to release [[radioactive contamination]] into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. An attack on a reactor's [[spent fuel pool]] could also be serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities.&lt;ref name=fas12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/pubs/_docs/Nuclear_Energy_Report-lowres.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power in the United States |author1=Charles D. Ferguson |author2=Frank A. Settle |name-list-style=amp |year=2012 |website=Federation of American Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the NRC carries out "Force on Force" (FOF) exercises at all nuclear power plant sites at least once every three years.&lt;ref name=fas12 /&gt;
In the United States, plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored.
The plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/security-enhancements.html| title=Nuclear Security – Five Years After 9/11 | publisher=U.S. NRC |access-date=23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insider sabotage is also a threat because insiders can observe and work around security measures.
Successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators' observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amacad.org/content/publications/pubContent.aspx?d=1427 |title=A Worst Practices Guide to Insider Threats: Lessons from Past Mistakes |author=Matthew Bunn |author-link=Matthew Bunn |author2=Scott Sagan|author2-link=Scott Sagan |name-list-style=amp |date=2014 |publisher=The American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|United States and [[USSR]]/Russian [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945–2006. The [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] was the main driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name="thebulletin.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usec.com/ |title=home |publisher=usec.com |date=2013-05-24 |access-date=2013-06-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621223711/http://www.usec.com/ |archive-date=2013-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Nuclear proliferation is the spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s, fissionable material, and weapons-related nuclear technology to states that do not already possess nuclear weapons. Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can also be used to make nuclear weapons. 
For this reason, nuclear power presents proliferation risks.

Nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon. An example of this is the concern over [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]].&lt;ref name=dfall2009&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |author1=Steven E. Miller |author2=Scott D. Sagan |name-list-style=amp |date=Fall 2009 |journal=Dædalus |doi=10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.7 |volume=138 |issue=4 |page=7 |s2cid=57568427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the [[Non-proliferation treaty]], to which 190 countries adhere.
As of April 2012, there are [[Nuclear power by country|thirty one countries]] that have civil nuclear power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html |title=Nuclear Power in the World Today |publisher=World-nuclear.org |access-date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine have nuclear weapons]]. The vast majority of these [[nuclear weapons state]]s have produced weapons before commercial nuclear power stations.

A fundamental goal for global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=dfall2009 /&gt;
The [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] was an international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would receive [[nuclear fuel]] at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous development of a uranium enrichment program.
The France-based [[Eurodif]]/''European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium'' is a program that successfully implemented this concept, with [[Nuclear power in Spain|Spain]] and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the French-controlled enrichment facility, but without a transfer of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/|title=Uranium Enrichment |publisher= World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Iran was an early participant from 1974 and remains a shareholder of Eurodif via [[Sofidif]].

A 2009 United Nations report said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Sovacool |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin K. Sovacool |date=2011 |title=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |location=Hackensack, NJ |page=190 |isbn=978-981-4322-75-1|title-link=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, power reactors can also reduce nuclear weapons arsenals when military-grade nuclear materials are reprocessed to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants.
The [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] is considered the single most successful [[non-proliferation]] program to date.&lt;ref name="thebulletin.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/support-of-the-megatons-to-megawatts-program |title=The Bulletin of atomic scientists support the megatons to megawatts program |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708162741/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/support-of-the-megatons-to-megawatts-program |archive-date=2011-07-08 |access-date=2012-09-15|date=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to 2005, the program had processed $8 billion of high enriched, weapons-grade uranium into [[low enriched uranium]] suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors by diluting it with [[natural uranium]].
This corresponds to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |title=Megatons to Megawatts Eliminates Equivalent of 10,000 Nuclear Warheads |publisher=Usec.com |date=2005-09-21 |access-date=2013-06-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426130245/http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |archive-date=2013-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For approximately two decades, this material generated nearly 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the United States, or about half of all U.S. nuclear electricity, with a total of around 7,000 [[TWh]] of electricity produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dawn Stover |date=2014-02-21 |title=More megatons to megawatts |url=http://thebulletin.org/more-megatons-megawatts |journal=The Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In total it is estimated to have cost $17 billion, a "bargain for US ratepayers", with Russia profiting $12 billion from the deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Much needed profit for the Russian nuclear oversight industry, which after the collapse of the [[Soviet economy]], had difficulties paying for the maintenance and security of the Russian Federations highly enriched uranium and warheads.&lt;ref name="A Farewell to Arms, 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/529861/a-farewell-to-arms/|title=Against Long Odds, MIT's Thomas Neff Hatched a Plan to Turn Russian Warheads into American Electricity|first=Anne-Marie Corley, SM|last=’09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Megatons to Megawatts Program was hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name="thebulletin.org" /&gt;
However, without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.
As of 2013 Russia appears to not be interested in extending the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-12-05 |title=Future Unclear For 'Megatons To Megawatts' Program |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121125743 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=NPR |access-date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is one of the leading [[low carbon power generation]] methods of producing [[electricity]], and in terms of [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated]], has emission values comparable to or lower than [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="Nrel.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html | title=Nuclear Power Results – Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization| quote=Collectively, life cycle assessment literature shows that nuclear power is similar to other renewable and much lower than fossil fuel in total life cycle GHG emissions. |publisher=nrel.gov |author= National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) |date=2013-01-24 |access-date=2013-06-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702205635/http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_nuclear.html |archive-date=2013-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sustain_lca_results.html | title=Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Results and Findings.

A 2014 analysis of the [[carbon footprint]] literature by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) reported that the embodied [[Life cycle assessment|total life-cycle]] [[emission intensity]] of nuclear power has a median value of 12&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}[[carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kilowatt-hour|kWh]], which is the lowest among all commercial [[baseload]] energy sources.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex III: Technology–specific cost and performance parameters |year=2014 |publisher=IPCC |at=table A.III.2 |access-date=2019-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report.mitigation2014.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics &amp; Methodology. |year=2014 |publisher=IPCC |at=section A.II.9.3 |access-date=2019-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is contrasted with [[coal]] and [[natural gas]] at 820 and 490&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}} eq/kWh.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III" /&gt;&lt;ref name="report.mitigation2014.org" /&gt;
From the beginning of its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in [[thermal power station]]s.&lt;ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895" /&gt;

=== Radiation ===
The average dose from natural [[background radiation]] is 2.4 [[millisievert]] per year (mSv/a) globally. It varies between 1&amp;nbsp;mSv/a and 13&amp;nbsp;mSv/a, depending mostly on the geology of the location. According to the United Nations ([[UNSCEAR]]), regular nuclear power plant operations, including the nuclear fuel cycle, increases this amount by 0.0002&amp;nbsp;mSv/a of public exposure as a global average. The average dose from operating nuclear power plants to the local populations around them is less than 0.0001&amp;nbsp;mSv/a.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly |publisher=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For comparison, the average dose to those living within 50&amp;nbsp;miles of a [[coal power plant]] is over three times this dose, at 0.0003 mSv/a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsc.org/resources/issues/rad/exposure.aspx |title=National Safety Council |publisher=Nsc.org |access-date=18 June 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012025401/http://www.nsc.org/resources/issues/rad/exposure.aspx |archive-date=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernobyl resulted in the most affected surrounding populations and male recovery personnel receiving an average initial 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;mSv over a few hours to weeks, while the remaining global legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident in average exposure is 0.002&amp;nbsp;mSv/a and is continually dropping at the decaying rate, from the initial high of 0.04&amp;nbsp;mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA /&gt;

Proponents also claim that the present quantity of nuclear waste is small and can be reduced through the latest technology of newer reactors and that the operational safety record of fission-electricity is unparalleled.&lt;ref name="Bernard L. Cohen 1990"/&gt;

Kharecha and [[James Hansen|Hansen]] estimated that "global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent (GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning" and, if continued, it could prevent up to 7 million deaths and 240 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq emissions by 2050.&lt;ref name="Kharecha Pushker A 2013 4889–4895" /&gt;

Several studies suggest that it might be theoretically possible to cover a majority of world energy generation with new renewable sources.
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has said that if governments were supportive, renewable energy supply could account for close to 80% of the world's energy use by 2050.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news|author=Fiona Harvey|date=2011-05-09|title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power is comparable to, and in some cases lower, than many renewable energy sources in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered.&lt;ref name="MarkandyaWilkinson2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="without the hot air" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Starfelt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230434/http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-09-27|title=Economic Analysis of Various Options of Electricity Generation – Taking into Account Health and Environmental Effects|author1=Nils Starfelt|author2=Carl-Erik Wikdahl|access-date=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nuclear reactors also produce a much smaller volume of waste, although much more toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Biello|date=2009-01-28|title=Spent Nuclear Fuel: A Trash Heap Deadly for 250,000 Years or a Renewable Energy Source?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-waste-lethal-trash-or-renewable-energy-source|journal=Scientific American|access-date=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speed of transition and investment needed====
Analysis in 2015 by professor [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry W. Brook]] and colleagues found that nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely within 10 years. This finding was based on the historically modest and proven rate at which nuclear energy was added in France and Sweden during their building programs in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potential for Worldwide Displacement of Fossil-Fuel Electricity by Nuclear Energy in Three Decades Based on Extrapolation of Regional Deployment Data|first1=Staffan A.|last1=Qvist|first2=Barry W.|last2=Brook|date=13 May 2015|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0124074|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124074|pmid=25970621|pmc=4429979|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1024074Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discovery.com/dscovrd/tech/report-world-can-rid-itself-of-fossil-fuel-dependence-in-as-little-as-10-years/ |title=Report: World can Rid Itself of Fossil Fuel Dependence in as little as 10 years| work= Discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all [[world energy consumption|global energy]], including transportation [[synthetic fuels]] etc., could be generated within approximately 30 years if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to historical proven installation rates calculated in [[Gigawatt|GW]] per year per unit of global [[GDP]] (GW/year/$).&lt;ref name="brook_could_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.041|volume=42|title=Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem? The affirmative case|year=2012|journal=Energy Policy|pages=4–8|author=Brook Barry W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is in contrast to the conceptual studies for [[100% renewable energy]] systems, which would require an orders of magnitude more costly global investment per year, which has no historical precedent.&lt;ref name="loftus_critical_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Peter J.|last2=Cohen|first2=Armond M.|last3=Long|first3=Jane C.S.|last4=Jenkins|first4=Jesse D.|title=A critical review of global decarbonization scenarios: what do they tell us about feasibility?|journal=WIREs Climate Change|date=January 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=93–112|doi=10.1002/wcc.324|url=https://www.qualenergia.it/sites/default/files/articolo-doc/wcc324-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These renewable scenarios would also need far greater land devoted to wind, wave and solar projects, and the inherent assumption that energy use will decrease in the future.&lt;ref name="brook_could_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="loftus_critical_2015" /&gt; As Brook notes, the "principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives."&lt;ref name="brook_could_2012" /&gt;

====Seasonal energy storage requirements====
Some analysts argue that conventional renewable energy sources, wind and solar do not offer the scalability necessary for a large-scale decarbonization of the electric grid, mainly due to [[intermittency]]-related considerations.&lt;ref name=Kloor&gt;{{cite news|last=Kloor|first=Keith|date=2013-01-11|title=The Pro-Nukes Environmental Movement |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html | work=Slate.com "The Big Questions" Blog |publisher=The Slate Group|access-date=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smil|first=Vaclav|date=2012-06-28|title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0|journal=IEEE Spectrum|volume=49|issue=7|pages=46–52|access-date=2014-01-24|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2012.6221082|s2cid=9842335|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320153801/https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0|archive-date=2019-03-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heuberger |first1=Clara Franziska |last2=Mac Dowell |first2=Niall |title=Real-World Challenges with a Rapid Transition to 100% Renewable Power Systems |journal=Joule |date=March 2018 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=367–370 |doi=10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.002|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2018 analysis by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] argued that, to be much more cost-effective as they approach deep [[decarbonization]], electricity systems should integrate [[baseload]] low carbon resources, such as nuclear, with renewables, storage and demand response.&lt;ref name=MIT2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Future-of-Nuclear-Energy-in-a-Carbon-Constrained-World.pdf|title=The Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World|date=2018|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places which aim to [[fossil fuel phase-out|phase out fossil fuels]] in favor of [[low carbon power]], such as the [[United Kingdom]], seasonal energy storage is difficult to provide, so having renewables supply over 60% of electricity might be expensive. {{As of|2019}} whether interconnectors or new nuclear would be more expensive than taking renewables over 60% is still being researched and debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Does Hitachi decision mean the end of UK's nuclear ambitions? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/17/does-the-hitachi-decision-mean-the-end-of-the-uks-nuclear-dream |work=The Guardian |date=17 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power stations require approximately one [[square kilometer]] of land per typical reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Land Needs for Wind, Solar Dwarf Nuclear Plant's Footprint |url=https://www.nei.org/news/2015/land-needs-for-wind-solar-dwarf-nuclear-plants |website=nei.org |publisher=NEI |date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/03/f34/qtr-2015-chapter10.pdf |title=Quadrennial technology review concepts in integrated analysis|date= September 2015 |page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists and [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] have begun to question the global renewable energy expansion proposals, as they are opposed to the frequently controversial use of once forested land to situate renewable energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/wind-energy-encounters-problems-and-resistance-in-germany-a-910816.html |title=Eco-Blowback Mutiny in the Land of Wind Turbines| work= Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy five academic conservationists signed a letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/featurenuclear-power-good-for-biodiversity-4583904/ |title=Nuclear power – good for biodiversity? |author= Heidi Vella|work= Power Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a more effective policy to mitigate climate change involving the [[reforestation]] of this land proposed for renewable energy production, to its prior [[natural landscape]], by means of the native trees that previously inhabited it, in tandem with the lower land use footprint of nuclear energy, as the path to assure both the commitment to carbon emission reductions and to succeed with landscape [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] programs that are part of the global native species protection and re-introduction initiatives.&lt;ref name="conservationmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.conservationmagazine.org/2014/12/is-nuclear-power-key-to-biodiversity/ |title=Is nuclear power key to biodiversity? |work=Conservation magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brook |first1=Barry W. |last2=Bradshaw |first2=Corey J.

These scientists argue that government commitments to increase renewable energy usage while simultaneously making commitments to expand areas of [[biological conservation]] are two competing land-use outcomes, in opposition to one another, that are increasingly coming into conflict. With the existing [[protected area]]s for conservation at present regarded as insufficient to safeguard [[biodiversity]] "the conflict for space between energy production and habitat will remain one of the key future conservation issues to resolve."&lt;ref name="conservationmagazine.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

==Research==
===Advanced fission reactor designs===
{{Main|Generation IV reactor}}
[[File:GenIVRoadmap-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Generation IV roadmap from [[Argonne National Laboratory]]]]
Current fission reactors in operation around the world are [[generation II reactor|second]] or [[generation III reactor|third generation]] systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been already retired.
Research into advanced [[generation IV reactor]] types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve economics, safety, proliferation resistance, natural resource utilization and the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity.
Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are expected to be available for commercial construction after 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ossfoundation.us/projects/energy/nuclear |title=4th Generation Nuclear Power – OSS Foundation |publisher=Ossfoundation.us |access-date=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission ===
{{Main|Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid}}
Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by the use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–28 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a| s2cid = 205047403 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090701/pdf/460025a.pdf | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant.
Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.

Several experimental nuclear fusion reactors and facilities exist.
The largest and most ambitious international nuclear fusion project currently in progress is [[ITER]], a large [[tokamak]] under construction in France.
ITER is planned to pave the way for commercial fusion power by demonstrating self-sustained nuclear fusion reactions with positive energy gain.
Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns.
The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027–11 years after initially anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W Wayt Gibbs |date=2013-12-30 |title=Triple-threat method sparks hope for fusion |journal=Nature|volume=505 |issue=7481 |pages=9–10 |bibcode=2014Natur.505....9G |doi=10.1038/505009a |pmid=24380935 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, [[DEMOnstration Power Station|DEMO]], has been proposed.&lt;ref name="ITERorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |title=Beyond ITER |publisher=Information Services, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory |website=The ITER Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107220145/http://www.iter.org/Future-beyond.htm |archive-date=2006-11-07 |access-date=2011-02-05 |url-status=dead }} – Projected fusion power timeline&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EFDA_Activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |title=Overview of EFDA Activities |website=www.efda.org |publisher=[[European Fusion Development Agreement]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001123645/http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt |archive-date=2006-10-01 |access-date=2006-11-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach, that of an [[inertial fusion power plant]].

Fusion-powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission-electric power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and [[plasma containment]] led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.&lt;ref name="ITERorg" /&gt;
