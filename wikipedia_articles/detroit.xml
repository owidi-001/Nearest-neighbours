'''Detroit''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|t|r|ɔɪ|t}}, {{small|locally also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|t|r|ɔɪ|t}}) is the largest and [[List of cities in Michigan by population|most-populous city]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]], the largest U.S. city on the [[Canada–United States border|United States–Canada border]], and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]]. The municipality of Detroit had a 2019 estimated population of 670,031, making it the [[List of United States cities by population|24th-most populous city]] in the United States. The [[metropolitan area]], known as [[Metro Detroit]], is home to 4.3&amp;nbsp;million people, making it the second-largest in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] after the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], and 14th-largest in the United States. Regarded as a major cultural center, Detroit is known for its contributions to [[Music of Detroit|music]] and as a repository for art, [[Architecture of metropolitan Detroit|architecture]] and design, along with its historical automotive background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/detroit-mi-population|title=Detroit, Michigan Population 2020 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=Worldpopulationreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detroit is a major port on the [[Detroit River]], one of the four major [[strait]]s that connect the [[Great Lakes]] system to the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] are connected through [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel|a highway tunnel]], [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel|railway tunnel]], and the [[Ambassador Bridge]], which is the second busiest international crossing in North America, after [[San Diego–Tijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN19233434|title=Massive traffic cripples Tijuana border crossing|date=April 19, 2007|website=Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1701, [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] founded [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]], the future city of Detroit. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the [[Great Lakes region]]. The city's population became the 4th-largest in the nation in 1920, after only [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]], with the expansion of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|auto industry]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Nolan, Jenny (June 15, 1999).[http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 How Prohibition made Detroit a bootlegger's dream town] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120709135445/http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 |date=July 9, 2012 }}. Michigan History, ''The Detroit News''. Retrieved on November 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As Detroit's industrialization took off, the [[Detroit International Riverfront|Detroit River]] became the busiest commercial hub in the world. The strait carried over 65 million tons of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world each year; the freight throughput was more than three times that of [[New York City|New York]] and about four times that of [[London]]. By the 1940s, the city's population remained the fourth-largest in the country. However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid [[suburbanization]], Detroit entered a state of [[Decline of Detroit|urban decay]] and lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. Since reaching a peak of 1.85&amp;nbsp;million at the [[1950 United States Census|1950 census]], Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 percent.&lt;ref name=CensusCity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26:2622000 |access-date=March 3, 2012 |title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525104940/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26%3A2622000 |archive-date=May 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Detroit [[Detroit bankruptcy|became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy]], which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/detroit/detroit-bankruptcy-officially-over-finances-handed-back-to-the-city|title=Detroit bankruptcy officially over, finances handed back to the city |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053605/http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/detroit/detroit-bankruptcy-officially-over-finances-handed-back-to-the-city |archive-date=March 4, 2016|work=WXYZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture of Detroit|Detroit's diverse culture]] has had both local and international influence, particularly in [[Music of Detroit|music]], with the city giving rise to the genres of [[Motown]] and [[Techno music|techno]], and playing an important role in the development of [[Detroit jazz|jazz]], [[Music of Detroit#hip-hop|hip-hop]], [[Music of Detroit#rock and roll|rock]], and [[Music of Detroit#punk|punk]] music. The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of [[Architecture of metropolitan Detroit|architectural monuments]] and [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Detroit, Michigan|historic places]]. Since the 2000s [[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieved several large-scale [[Planning and development in Detroit|revitalizations]], including the restoration of several historic [[Performing arts in Detroit|theatres]] and entertainment venues, [[List of tallest buildings in Detroit|high-rise]] renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. More recently, the population of [[Downtown Detroit]], [[Midtown Detroit]], and various other neighborhoods have increased.

[[Paleo-Indian]] people inhabited areas near Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago including the culture referred to as the [[Mound-builders]].&lt;ref name="lemke"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemke|first1=Ashley|title=Great Lakes Rangifer and Paleoindians: Archaeological and Paleontological Caribou Remains from Michigan|journal=PaleoAmerica|date=2015|volume=1|issue=3|page=277|doi=10.1179/2055557115Y.0000000003|s2cid=129841191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the region was inhabited by [[Huron people|Huron]], [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples.&lt;ref name="teasdale"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teasdale|first1=Guillaume|title=Old Friends and New Foes: French Settlers and Indians in the Detroit River Border Region|journal=Michigan Historical Review|date=2012|volume=38|issue=2|pages=35–62|doi=10.5342/michhistrevi.38.2.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is known by the [[Anishinaabe]] people as ''Waawiiyaataanong,'' translating to 'where the water curves around'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=DeVito|first=Lee|title=How New Red Order and MOCAD could redefine 'land acknowledgment' for Indigenous people|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/how-new-red-order-and-mocad-could-redefine-land-acknowledgment-for-indigenous-people/Content?oid=25854180|access-date=2021-06-27|website=Detroit Metro Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Europeans did not penetrate into the region and reach the straits of Detroit until French missionaries and traders worked their way around the [[League of the Iroquois]], with whom they were at war and other Iroquoian tribes in the 1630s.&lt;ref name="AmHeritageBk"&gt;

British negotiations with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to a Crown policy limiting settlements below the [[Great Lakes]] and west of the [[Alleghenies]]. Many colonial American would-be migrants resented this restraint and became supporters of the [[American Revolution]]. The 1778 raids and resultant 1779 decisive [[Sullivan Expedition]] reopened the [[Ohio Country]] to westward emigration, which began almost immediately. By 1800 white settlers were pouring westwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov/historicalmarkers/inventoryfour.html|title=Museum Outreach|website=exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was named by [[New France|French colonists]], referring to the [[Detroit River]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|le détroit du lac Érié}}, meaning ''the [[strait]] of Lake Erie''), linking [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]; in the historical context, the strait included the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]] and the Detroit River.&lt;ref name="RivièreduDétroit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/french/exhibits/franco_ontarian/big/big_36_map_detroit_river.htm |title=La rivière du Détroit depuis le lac Érié, 1764 |access-date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703220808/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/french/exhibits/franco_ontarian/big/big_36_map_detroit_river.htm |archive-date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of U.S. place names of French origin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 1701, the French explorer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], along with more than a hundred other settlers, began constructing a small fort on the north bank of the Detroit River. Cadillac would later name the settlement [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/thisisdetroit1700000wood_n6a3|url-access=registration|title=This is Detroit, 1701–2001|last=Woodford|first=Arthur M.|date=2001|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0814329144|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thisisdetroit1700000wood_n6a3/page/15 15]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain]], Minister of Marine under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Riley, John L.|title=The Once and Future Great Lakes Country: An Ecological History|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=2013|isbn=978-0-7735-4177-1}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A church was soon founded here, and the parish was known as Sainte Anne de Détroit. France offered free land to colonists to attract families to Detroit; when it reached a population of 800 in 1765, this was the largest European settlement between [[Montreal]] and [[New Orleans]], both also French settlements, in the former colonies of New France and La Louisiane, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm French Ontario in the 17th and 18th centuries – Detroit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040824111504/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm |date=August 24, 2004 }}.

By 1773, after the addition of Anglo-American settlers, the population of Detroit was 1,400. By 1778, its population reached 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in what was known as the [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]] since the British takeover of French colonies following their victory in the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''Many Roads to Red River'' (2001), p69&lt;/ref&gt;

The region's economy was based on the lucrative [[fur trade]], in which numerous Native American people had important roles as trappers and traders. Today the [[flag of Detroit]] reflects its French colonial heritage. Descendants of the earliest French and [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] settlers formed a cohesive community, who gradually were superseded as the dominant population after more [[Anglo-American]] settlers arrived in the early 19th century with American westward migration. Living along the shores of Lake St. Clair and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the ethnic French Canadians of Detroit, also known as [[Muskrat French]] in reference to the fur trade, remain a subculture in the region in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaForest|first1=James|title='Muskrat French': French-Canadian River Culture in the Windsor/Detroit Region|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/muskrat-french-french-canadian-river-culture-in-the-windsordetroit-region/|website=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|publisher=James LaForest|access-date=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beneteau|first1=Marcel|title=Detroit River: A Special Place in French North American History|url=http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/en/article-453/Detroit_River:_A_Special_Place_in_French_North_American_History.html|website=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|publisher=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|access-date=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–63), the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France, British troops gained control of the settlement in 1760 and shortened its name to ''Detroit''. Several regional Native American tribes, such as the Potowatomi, Ojibwe and Huron, launched [[Pontiac's War]] in 1763, and [[siege of Fort Detroit|laid siege]] to [[Fort Detroit]], but failed to capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America east of the Mississippi to Britain following the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan (first the territory, then the state). [[William Hull]], the United States commander at Detroit surrendered without a fight to British troops and their Native American allies during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Siege of Detroit]], believing his forces were vastly outnumbered. The [[Battle of Frenchtown]] (January 18–23, 1813) was part of a U.S. effort to retake the city, and U.S. troops suffered their highest fatalities of any battle in the war. This battle is commemorated at [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]] south of Detroit in [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]]. Detroit was recaptured by the United States later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/rira/learn/historyculture/index.htm|title=River Raisin National Battlefield Park|website=Nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1815.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; As the city expanded, a geometric street plan developed by [[Augustus B. Woodward]] was followed, featuring grand boulevards as in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/the-scene/archives/2018/06/01/how-the-woodward-plan-for-greater-detroit-died-200-years-ago-today|title=How the Woodward Plan for greater Detroit died 200 years ago today|first=Michael|last=Jackman|website=Detroit Metro Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], the city's access to the Canada–US border made it a key stop for [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|refugee slaves]] gaining freedom in the North along the [[Underground Railroad]]. Many went across the Detroit River to Canada to escape pursuit by slave catchers.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chadwick | first = Bruce | title = Traveling the underground railroad : a visitor's guide to more than 300 sites | publisher = Carol Pub.

Numerous men from Detroit volunteered to fight for the Union during the [[American Civil War]], including the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment. It was part of the legendary [[Iron Brigade]], which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863. When the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment arrived to fortify Washington, D.C., President [[Abraham Lincoln]] is quoted as saying, "Thank God for Michigan!" [[George Armstrong Custer]] led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the Civil War and called them the "Wolverines."&lt;ref&gt;Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). "Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg," ''[[Michigan History magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, wealthy industry and shipping magnates commissioned the design and construction of several [[Gilded Age]] mansions east and west of the current downtown, along the major avenues of the Woodward plan. Most notable among them was the [[David Whitney House]] at 4421 [[Woodward Avenue]], and the grand avenue became a favored address for mansions. During this period, some referred to Detroit as the "Paris of the West" for its architecture, grand avenues in the Paris style, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. Strategically located along the [[Great Lakes]] waterway, Detroit emerged as a major port and transportation hub. {{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first automobile in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue. During this growth period, Detroit expanded its borders by annexing all or part of several surrounding villages and townships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why do Hamtramck and Highland Park exist inside the city of Detroit?|url=https://wdet.org/posts/2014/09/19/80119-why-do-hamtramck-and-highland-park-exist-inside-the-city-of-detroit/|access-date=2021-01-14|website=Wdet.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Henry Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing—and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge Brothers]], [[Packard]], and [[Walter Chrysler]]—established Detroit's status in the early 20th century as the world's automotive capital.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; The growth of the auto industry was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the Midwest and nation, with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations, as well as factories for parts and tires.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1907, the [[Detroit International Riverfront|Detroit River]] carried 67,292,504 tons of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world. For comparison, [[London]] shipped 18,727,230 tons, and [[New York City|New York]] shipped 20,390,953 tons. The river was dubbed "the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth" by [[The Detroit News]] in 1908.

With the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories, [[labor unions]] such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[United Auto Workers]] fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages. They initiated [[Strike action|strikes]] and other tactics in support of improvements such as [[8-hour working day|the 8-hour day/40-hour work week]], increased [[wage]]s, greater benefits, and improved [[Occupational safety and health|working conditions]]. The labor activism during those years increased the influence of union leaders in the city such as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of the [[Teamsters]] and [[Walter Reuther]] of the Autoworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crosscurrents.hawaii.edu/content.aspx?lang=eng&amp;site=us&amp;theme=work&amp;subtheme=UNION&amp;unit=USWORK029|title=Important U.S. Labor Leaders: Jimmy Hoffa|date=2003|website=Cross Currents|publisher=CULCON (A Digital Cultural Resource of the US-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange)|access-date=October 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the booming auto industry, Detroit became the 4th-largest city in the nation in 1920, following [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Biggest US Cities in 1920 - Historical Population Data|url=https://www.biggestuscities.com/1920|access-date=2021-06-04|website=www.biggestuscities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol]] from 1920 to 1933 resulted in the Detroit River becoming a major conduit for smuggling of illegal Canadian spirits.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following the rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period, it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] beginning in 1915. "By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK," whose members primarily opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, but also practiced discrimination against Black Americans.&lt;ref name="43riots"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ "Detroit Race Riots 1943"].

Retrieved on September 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the decline of the KKK in the late 1920s, the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s. One-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic organizer with the federal [[Works Progress Administration]]. Some 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bak|first=Richard|date=2009-02-23|title=The Dark Days of the Black Legion|url=https://www.hourdetroit.com/community/the-dark-days-of-the-black-legion/|access-date=2021-01-14|website=Hour Detroit Magazine|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs expanded so rapidly due to the defense buildup in World War II that 400,000 people migrated to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many of them from the South. Whites, including ethnic Europeans, feared black competition for jobs and scarce housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work, but when in June 1943 Packard promoted three black people to work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 white workers walked off the job.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP3DbiRcbPAC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=I%E2%80%99d+rather+see+Hitler+and+Hirohito+win+than+work+next+to+a+nigger#v=onepage&amp;q=I%E2%80%99d%20rather%20see%20Hitler%20and%20Hirohito%20win%20than%20work%20next%20to%20a%20nigger Philip A.

====Postwar era====
Industrial mergers in the 1950s, especially in the automobile sector, increased [[oligopoly]] in the American auto industry. Detroit manufacturers such as [[Packard Motor Car Company|Packard]] and [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] merged into other companies and eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, in the [[1950 United States Census|1950 Census]], the city was the 5th-largest in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990 |year=1998 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/1998/demo/POP-twps0027.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this postwar era, the auto industry continued to create opportunities for many African Americans from the South, who continued with their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to Detroit and other northern and western cities to escape the strict [[Jim Crow]] laws and racial discrimination policies of the South. Postwar Detroit was a prosperous industrial center of mass production. The auto industry comprised about 60% of all industry in the city, allowing space for a plethora of separate booming businesses including stove making, brewing, furniture building, oil refineries, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and more. The expansion of jobs created unique opportunities for black Americans, who saw novel high employment rates: there was a 103% increase in the number of blacks employed in postwar Detroit. Black Americans who immigrated to northern industrial cities from the south still faced intense racial discrimination in the employment sector. Racial discrimination kept the workforce and better jobs predominantly white, while many black Detroiters held lower-paying factory jobs. Despite changes in demographics as the city’s black population expanded, Detroit's police force, fire department, and other city jobs continued to be held by predominantly white residents. This created an unbalanced racial power dynamic.&lt;ref name=tjs1&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59879791|title=The origins of the urban crisis: race and inequality in postwar Detroit : with a new preface by the author|date=August 21, 2005|isbn=0-691-12186-9|edition=1st Princeton Classic |location=Princeton|oclc=59879791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unequal opportunities in employment resulted in unequal housing opportunities for the majority of the black community: with overall lower incomes and facing the backlash of discriminatory housing policies, the black community was limited to lower cost, lower quality housing in the city. The surge in Detroit's black population with the Great Migration augmented the strain on housing scarcity. The liveable areas available to the black community were limited, and as a result, families often crowded together in unsanitary, unsafe, and illegal quarters. Such discrimination became increasingly evident in the policies of [[redlining]] implemented by banks and federal housing groups, which almost completely restricted the ability of blacks to improve their housing and encouraged white people to guard the racial divide that defined their neighborhoods. As a result, black people were often denied bank loans to obtain better housing, and interest rates and rents were unfairly inflated to prevent their moving into white neighborhoods. White residents and political leaders largely opposed the influx of black Detroiters to white neighborhoods, believing that their presence would lead to neighborhood deterioration (most predominantly black neighborhoods deteriorated due to local and federal governmental neglect). This perpetuated a cyclical exclusionary process that marginalized the agency of black Detroiters by trapping them in the unhealthiest, unsafest areas of the city.&lt;ref name=tjs1/&gt;

[[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1950|As in other major American cities]] in the postwar era, construction of a federally subsidized, extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit, and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car for higher-income residents easier. However, this construction had negative implications for many lower-income urban residents. Highways were constructed through and completely demolished neighborhoods of poor residents and black communities who had less political power to oppose them. The neighborhoods were mostly low income, considered blighted, or made up of older housing where investment had been lacking due to racial redlining, so the highways were presented as a kind of urban renewal. These neighborhoods (such as Black Bottom and Paradise Valley) were extremely important to the black communities of Detroit, providing spaces for independent black businesses and social/cultural organizations.. Their destruction displaced residents with little consideration of the effects of breaking up functioning neighborhoods and businesses.&lt;ref name=tjs1/&gt;

In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used [[streetcar|electric streetcar line]], which traveled along the length of Woodward Avenue, was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on [[Woodward Avenue]] every 60 seconds.&lt;ref name="Peter Gavrilovich 2000 p.232"&gt;Peter Gavrilovich &amp; Bill McGraw (2000) ''The Detroit Almanac: 300 Years of Life in the Motor City.'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9040 News+Views: Back track], ''Metro Times,'' Retrieved on July 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these changes in the area's transportation system favored low-density, auto-oriented development rather than high-density urban development. Industry also moved to the suburbs, seeking large plots of land for single-story factories. By the 21st century, the metro Detroit area had developed as one of the most [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] job markets in the United States; combined with poor public transport, this resulted in many new jobs being beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20130418/BUSINESS06/304180118/jobs-sprawl-Detroit-Brookings-Institution "Metro Detroit job sprawl worst in U.S.; many jobs beyond reach of poor"], ''Detroit Free Press''.

In 1950, the city held about one-third of the state's population, anchored by its industries and workers. Over the next sixty years, the city's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state's population. During the same time period, the sprawling Detroit metropolitan area, which surrounds and includes the city, grew to contain more than half of Michigan's population.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; The shift of population and jobs eroded Detroit's tax base.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In June 1963, Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] gave a [[Detroit Walk to Freedom|major speech]] as part of a civil rights march in Detroit that foreshadowed his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech in Washington, D.C., two months later. While the [[civil rights movement]] gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner-city black youth who wanted change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=1967 Detroit Riots|url=https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/1967-detroit-riots|access-date=2021-01-14|website=HISTORY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the [[1967 Detroit riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in July 1967. Governor [[George W. Romney]] ordered the [[Michigan National Guard]] into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Fine, ''Violence in the Model City: The Cavanaugh Administration, Race Relations, and the Detroit Riot of 1967'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most costly riot in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

On August 18, 1970, the [[NAACP]] filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor [[William Milliken]], charging ''de facto'' public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain [[Racial segregation in the United States#Education|racial segregation]] in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, as the composition of students in the schools followed segregated neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Meinke2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meinke|first=Samantha|title=Milliken v Bradley: The Northern Battle for Desegregation|journal=Michigan Bar Journal|date=September 2011|volume=90|issue=9|pages=20–22|url=http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article1911.pdf|access-date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling.

In November 1973, the city elected [[Coleman Young]] as its first black mayor. After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department, which was predominately white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Police Department|url=http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-police-department|website=Detroit Historical Society|access-date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but the tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered $600&amp;nbsp;million for building a regional [[rapid transit]] system, under a single regional authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How metro Detroit transit went from best to worst|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/02/06/michigan-detroit-public-transit/22926133/|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|access-date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Following the failure to reach a regional agreement over the larger system, the city moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the [[Detroit People Mover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Detroit ended up with the worst public transit|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/how-detroit-ended-up-with-the-worst-public-transit/Content?oid=2143889|access-date=April 21, 2015|newspaper=Metro Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] also affected Detroit and the U.S. auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign makers as the price of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles of the auto industry, as their sales and market share declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city used [[eminent domain]] to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poletown Becomes Just a Memory: GM Plant Opens, Replacing Old Detroit Neighborhood|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-18/business/fi-6228_1_gm-plant|newspaper=LA Times | first=James|last=Risen|date=September 18, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mayor, Young sought to revive the city by seeking to increase investment in the city's declining downtown. The [[Renaissance Center]], a mixed-use office and retail complex, opened in 1977. This group of skyscrapers was an attempt to keep businesses in downtown.&lt;ref name="Woodford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="partnership" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;Bailey, Ruby L.(August 22, 2007). "The D is a draw: Most suburbanites are repeat visitors," ''Detroit Free Press''. Quote: A Local 4 poll conducted by Selzer and Co., finds, "nearly two-thirds of residents of suburban Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties say they at least occasionally dine, attend cultural events or take in professional games in Detroit."&lt;/ref&gt; Young also gave city support to other large developments to attract middle and upper-class residents back to the city. Despite the Renaissance Center and other projects, the downtown area continued to lose businesses to the [[Automobile dependency|automobile-dependent]] suburbs. Major stores and hotels closed, and many large office buildings went vacant. Young was criticized for being too focused on downtown development and not doing enough to lower the city's high crime rate and improve city services to residents.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

High unemployment was compounded by [[middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, and some residents leaving the state to find work. The result for the city was a higher proportion of poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed property values, abandoned buildings, abandoned neighborhoods, high crime rates, and a pronounced demographic imbalance.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}&lt;!-- In what sense? --&gt;

One way the city obtained this money was through the Detroit Institute of the Arts. Holding over 60,000 pieces of art worth billions of dollars, some saw it as the key to funding this investment. The city came up with a plan to monetize the art and sell it leading to the DIA becoming a private organization.

One of the largest post-bankruptcy efforts to improve city services has been to work to fix the city's broken street lighting system. At one time it was estimated that 40% of lights were not working, which resulted in public safety issues and abandonment of housing. The plan called for replacing outdated high-pressure sodium lights with 65,000 LED lights.

The city has also seen a rise in [[gentrification]].

===Topography===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|142.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|138.75|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|4.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer files"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=July 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit is the principal city in [[Metro Detroit]] and [[Southeast Michigan]]. It is situated in the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]] is the only international [[wildlife preserve]] in North America, and is uniquely located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The Refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along {{convert|48|mi|km|0}} of the [[Detroit River]] and [[Western Lake Erie]] shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Refuge |url=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Detroit_River/about.html |website=Detroit River |access-date=27 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city slopes gently from the northwest to southeast on a [[till plain]] composed largely of glacial and lake clay.

[[Belle Isle Park]] is a {{convert|982|acre|sqmi ha|adj=on}} island park in the [[Detroit River]], between Detroit and [[Windsor, Ontario]]. It is connected to the mainland by the [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|MacArthur Bridge]] in Detroit. Belle Isle Park contains such attractions as the [[James Scott Memorial Fountain]], the [[Belle Isle Conservatory]], the [[Detroit Yacht Club]] on an adjacent island, a half-mile (800 m) beach, a golf course, a nature center, monuments, and gardens. The city skyline may be viewed from the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Three road systems cross the city: the original [[France|French]] template, with avenues radiating from the waterfront, and true [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|north–south roads]] based on the [[Northwest Ordinance]] township system. The city is north of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Detroit is the only major city along the Canada–U.S. border in which one travels south in order to cross into Canada.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Detroit has four border crossings: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]] provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]] providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the [[Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry]], near the Windsor Salt Mine and [[Zug Island]]. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city was developed over a {{convert|1500|acre|ha|adj=on}} salt mine that is {{convert|1100|ft|m|-1}} below the surface.

Seen in panorama, Detroit's waterfront shows a variety of architectural styles. The [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] Neo-Gothic spires of the [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) were designed to refer to the city's [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers. Together with the [[Renaissance Center]], these buildings form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the Art Deco style include the [[Guardian Building]] and [[Penobscot Building]] downtown, as well as the [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] in the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] area near [[Wayne State University]]. Among the city's prominent structures are United States' largest [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Detroit Opera House]], and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], all built in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=AIADetroit&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Hill, Eric J.  |author2=John Gallagher | title= AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture| year=2002 | publisher=Wayne State University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DetArch&gt;{{Cite book | author=Sharoff, Robert | title=American City: Detroit Architecture| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6| author-link=Robert Sharoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, residential high-rises are found in upper-class neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront, extending toward [[Grosse Pointe]], and the [[Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District|Palmer Park]] neighborhood just west of Woodward. The University Commons-Palmer Park district in northwest Detroit, near the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] and [[Marygrove College]], anchors historic neighborhoods including [[Palmer Woods]], [[Sherwood Forest, Detroit|Sherwood Forest]], and the [[University District, Detroit|University District]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Forty-two significant structures or sites are listed on the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Detroit, Michigan|National Register of Historic Places]]. Neighborhoods constructed prior to World War II feature the architecture of the times, with wood-frame and brick houses in the working-class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in middle-class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in upper-class neighborhoods such as [[Brush Park]], [[Woodbridge, Detroit|Woodbridge]], [[Indian Village, Detroit|Indian Village]], [[Palmer Woods]], [[Boston-Edison Historic District|Boston-Edison]], and others.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Some of the oldest neighborhoods are along the major Woodward and [[East Jefferson Avenue Residential TR|East Jefferson]] corridors, which formed spines of the city. Some newer residential construction may also be found along the Woodward corridor and in the far west and northeast. The oldest extant neighborhoods include [[West Canfield Historic District|West Canfield]] and [[Brush Park]]. There have been multi-million dollar restorations of existing homes and construction of new homes and condominiums here.&lt;ref name=partnership&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html |title=Development and Growth |access-date=May 16, 2009 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613121052/http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html |archive-date=June 13, 2008 |work=City of Detroit Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Jaime (September 12, 2006).[http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/bpark61.aspx Falling for Brush Park].''Model D Media''.

The [[Detroit International Riverfront]] includes a partially completed three-and-one-half-mile riverfront promenade with a combination of parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas. It extends from [[Hart Plaza]] to the MacArthur Bridge, which connects to [[Belle Isle Park]], the largest island park in a U.S. city. The riverfront includes [[Tri-Centennial State Park]] and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. The second phase is a {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|sp=us|adj=on|abbr=off}} extension from Hart Plaza to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} of parkway from bridge to bridge.

In the [[2010 United States Census]], the city had 713,777 residents, ranking it the [[List of United States cities by population|18th most populous city]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="CensusCity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Census"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Katherine Q.|title=Detroit Population Down 25 Percent, Census Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23detroit.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 22, 2011|access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the large [[shrinking cities]] in the United States, Detroit has had the most dramatic decline in the population of the past 60 years (down 1,135,791) and the second-largest percentage decline (down 61.4%).

Detroit's 713,777 residents represent 269,445 households, and 162,924 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,144.3 people per square mile (1,895/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 349,170 housing units at an average density of 2,516.5 units per square mile (971.6/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Housing density has declined. The city has demolished thousands of Detroit's abandoned houses, planting some areas and in others allowing the growth of [[urban prairie]].

Of the 269,445 households, 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 21.5% were married couples living together, 31.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 39.5% were non-families, 34.0% were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59, and the average family size was 3.36.

There was a wide distribution of age in the city, with 31.1% under the age of 18, 9.7% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.5 males.

Beginning with the rise of the automobile industry, Detroit's population increased more than sixfold during the first half of the 20th century as an influx of European, Middle Eastern ([[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese]], [[Assyrian Americans|Assyrian/Chaldean]]), and Southern migrants brought their families to the city.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Baulch, Vivian M.

Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the original white families in Detroit saw this increase in diversity as a threat to their way of life and made it their mission to isolate black people from their neighborhoods, workplaces, and public institutions. Perhaps one of the most overt examples of neighborhood discrimination occurred in 1925 when African American physician [[Ossian Sweet]] found his home surrounded by an angry mob of his hostile white neighbors violently protesting his new move into a traditionally white neighborhood. [[Ossian Sweet|Sweet]] and ten of his family members and friends were put on trial for murder as one of the mob members throwing rocks at the newly purchased house was shot and killed by someone firing out of a second-floor window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-691-16255-3|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many middle-class families experienced the same kind of hostility as they sought the security of homeownership and the potential for upward mobility.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Detroit has a relatively large Mexican-American population. In the early 20th century, thousands of Mexicans came to Detroit to work in agricultural, automotive, and steel jobs. During the [[Mexican Repatriation]] of the 1930s many Mexicans in Detroit were willingly repatriated or forced to repatriate. By the 1940s much of the Mexican community began to settle what is now [[Mexicantown, Detroit|Mexicantown]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

By 1940, 80% of Detroit deeds contained [[restrictive covenants]] prohibiting African Americans from buying houses they could afford. These discriminatory tactics were successful as a majority of black people in Detroit resorted to living in all-black neighborhoods such as [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] and Paradise Valley. At this time, white people still made up about 90.4% of the city's population.&lt;ref name="census1" /&gt; From the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|1940s to the 1970s a second wave of black people moved to Detroit]] in search of employment and with the desire to escape the [[Jim Crow laws]] enforcing segregation in the south.&lt;ref name="Martin92"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/|title=Detroit and the Great Migration 1916–1929|last=Martin|first=Elizabeth Anne|publisher=University of Michigan|year=1992|chapter=City of Opportunity|quote=The thousands of African-Americans who flocked to Detroit were part of the "Great Migration" of the twentieth century.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212184120/http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/|archive-date=December 12, 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they soon found themselves once again excluded from many opportunities in Detroit—through [[Racially motivated crime|violence]] and policy perpetuating [[economic discrimination]] (e.g., [[redlining]]).&lt;ref name="DetroitDivided"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olcZfAD7cPEC&amp;pg=PP1|title=Detroit divided|author1=Reynolds Farley|author2=Sheldon Danziger|author3=Harry J.

In 1948, the landmark Supreme Court case of [[Shelley v. Kraemer]] outlawed restrictive covenants and while racism in housing did not disappear, it allowed affluent black families to begin moving to traditionally white neighborhoods. Many white families with the financial ability moved to the suburbs of Detroit taking their jobs and tax dollars with them. By 1950, much of the city's white population had moved to the suburbs as macrostructural processes such as "[[white flight]]" and "[[suburbanization]]" led to a complete population shift.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The [[Detroit riot of 1967]] is considered to be one of the greatest racial turning points in the history of the city. The ramifications of the uprising were widespread as there were many allegations of white police brutality towards Black Americans and over $36&amp;nbsp;million of insured property was lost. Discrimination and deindustrialization in tandem with racial tensions that had been intensifying in the previous years boiled over and led to an event considered to be the most damaging in Detroit's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-691-16255-3|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detroit has gained notoriety for its high amount of crime, having struggled with it for decades. The number of homicides peaked in 1974 at 714 and again in 1991 with 615.

The city of Detroit has a rich musical heritage and has contributed to a number of different genres over the decades leading into the new millennium.&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt; Important music events in the city include: the [[Detroit International Jazz Festival]], the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], the Motor City Music Conference (MC2), the Urban Organic Music Conference, the Concert of Colors, and the hip-hop Summer Jamz festival.&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Detroit blues]] artist [[John Lee Hooker]] became a long-term resident in the city's southwest [[Delray, Detroit|Delray]] neighborhood. Hooker, among other important [[blues]] musicians migrated from his home in [[Mississippi]] bringing the [[Delta blues]] to northern cities like Detroit. Hooker recorded for [[Fortune Records]], the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; Prominent emerging [[Jazz]] musicians of the 1960s included: trumpet player [[Donald Byrd]] who attended Cass Tech and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career and Saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]] who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums. The Graystone International Jazz Museum documents [[jazz]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Graystone Online |url=http://www.ipl.org.ar/exhibit/detjazz/Graystone.html |publisher=Internet Public Library of the University of Michigan |access-date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911002339/http://www.ipl.org.ar/exhibit/detjazz/Graystone.html |archive-date=September 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, prominent Motor City R&amp;B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s was [[Nolan Strong]], [[Andre Williams]] and [[Nathaniel Mayer]] – who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label, a family-operated label on Third Avenue in Detroit, was owned by the husband and wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;{{Cite book |first= David A. |last= Carson |title= Noise, and Revolution: The Birth of Detroit Rock 'n' Roll |publisher= University of Michigan Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-472-11503-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] founded [[Motown Records]] which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles]], [[Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes]], the [[The Jackson 5|Jackson 5]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]], [[The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)|The Spinners]], [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[The Elgins]], [[The Monitors (American band)|The Monitors]], [[The Velvelettes]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]. Artists were backed by in-house vocalists&lt;ref&gt;''Girl Groups – Fabulous Females Who Rocked The World'', by John Clemente&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Andantes]] and [[The Funk Brothers]], the Motown house band that was featured in Paul Justman's 2002 documentary film ''[[Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]'', based on Allan Slutsky's book of the same name.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

[[The Motown Sound]] played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. [[Aretha Franklin]], another Detroit R&amp;B star, carried the Motown Sound; however, she did not record with Berry's Motown Label.&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt;

Local artists and bands rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s including: the [[MC5]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[The Stooges]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Amboy Dukes]] featuring [[Ted Nugent]], [[Mitch Ryder]] and The Detroit Wheels, [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Suzi Quatro]]. The group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] emphasized the city's connection with rock in the song ''[[Detroit Rock City]]'' and the movie produced in 1999. In the 1980s, Detroit was an important center of the [[hardcore punk rock]] underground with many nationally known bands coming out of the city and its suburbs, such as [[The Necros]], [[The Meatmen]], and [[Negative Approach]].&lt;ref name="Carson"/&gt;

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transportation in metropolitan Detroit}}

With its proximity to Canada and its facilities, ports, major highways, rail connections and international airports, Detroit is an important transportation hub. The city has three international border crossings, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]] and [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]], linking Detroit to [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The Ambassador Bridge is the single busiest border crossing in North America, carrying 27% of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/ambass_brdg/ambass_brdge_ovrvw.htm Ambassador Bridge Crossing Summary] (May 11, 2005). ''U.S. Department of Transportation''. Retrieved on April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2015, Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced Canada has agreed to pay the entire cost to build a $250&amp;nbsp;million U.S. Customs plaza adjacent to the planned new Detroit–Windsor bridge, now the [[Gordie Howe International Bridge]]. Canada had already planned to pay for 95% of the bridge, which will cost $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion, and is expected to open in 2022 or 2023. "This allows Canada and Michigan to move the project forward immediately to its next steps which include further design work and property acquisition on the U.S. side of the border," Raitt said in a statement issued after she spoke in the House of Commons.

[[Mass transit]] in the region is provided by bus services. The [[Detroit Department of Transportation]] (DDOT) provides service within city limits up to the outer edges of the city. From there, the [[Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation|Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART)]] provides service to the suburbs and the city regionally with local routes and SMART's FAST service. FAST is a new service provided by SMART which offers limited stops along major corridors throughout the Detroit metropolitan area connecting the suburbs to downtown. The new high-frequency service travels along three of Detroit's busiest corridors, Gratiot, Woodward, and Michigan, and only stops at designated FAST stops. Cross border service between the downtown areas of Windsor and Detroit is provided by [[Transit Windsor]] via the Tunnel Bus.&lt;ref name=Tunnelbus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citywindsor.ca/000600.asp |title=Routes and Schedules |access-date=May 5, 2009 |website=Transit Windsor |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205706/http://www.citywindsor.ca/000600.asp |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freeways====
{{Main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit}}
Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free network of [[freeway]]s administered by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]]. Four major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]] surround the city. Detroit is connected via [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate&amp;nbsp;75]] (I-75) and [[Interstate 96|I-96]] to [[Ontario Highway 401|Kings Highway 401]] and to major [[Southern Ontario]] cities such as [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. I-75 (Chrysler and Fisher freeways) is the region's main north–south route, serving [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit–Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.&lt;ref name="Cantor"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Cantor |first= George |title= Detroit: An Insiders Guide to Michigan |year= 2005 |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-03092-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/exploremichigand0000cant }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east–west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways. [[Henry Ford]] built it to link the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. The [[Interstate 96 in Michigan|I-96]] freeway runs northwest–southeast through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.&lt;ref name="Cantor"/&gt;

[[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and [[Interstate 696|I-696]] in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. I-696 (Reuther Freeway) runs east–west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan state highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.&lt;ref name="Cantor"/&gt;
