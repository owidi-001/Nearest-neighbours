The first written records for the '''history of France''' appeared in the [[Iron Age France|Iron Age]]. What is now [[France]] made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as [[Gaul]]. Greek writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the [[Gauls]], the [[Aquitani]], and the [[Belgae]]. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were [[Celts|Celtic]] people speaking what is known as the [[Gaulish language]].

Over the course of the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] established colonies on the [[Mediterranean]] coast and the offshore islands. The [[Roman Republic]] annexed southern Gaul as the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman Legions under [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the rest of Gaul in the [[Gallic Wars]] of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a [[Gallo-Roman culture]] emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the [[Roman Empire]].

In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to [[barbarian]] raids and migration, most importantly by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]]. The Frankish king [[Clovis I]] united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under [[Charlemagne]]. The medieval [[Kingdom of France]] emerged from the western part of Charlemagne's [[Carolingian Empire]], known as [[West Francia]], and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the [[House of Capet]], founded by [[Hugh Capet]] in 987.

A [[Order of succession|succession]] crisis following the death of the last [[direct Capetian]] monarch in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] between the [[House of Valois]] and the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The war formally began in 1337 following [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'s attempt to seize the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] from its hereditary holder, [[Edward III of England]], the Plantagenet claimant to the French throne. Despite early Plantagenet victories, including the capture and ransom of [[John II of France]], fortunes turned in favor of the Valois later in the war. Among the notable figures of the war was [[Joan of Arc]], a French peasant girl who led French forces against the English, establishing herself as a national heroine. The war ended with a Valois victory in 1453.

Victory in the Hundred Years' War had the effect of strengthening French nationalism and vastly increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' period over the next centuries, France transformed into a centralized [[absolute monarchy]] through [[French Renaissance|Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. At the height of the [[French Wars of Religion]], France became embroiled in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], fought against rival factions the [[House of Bourbon]] and the [[House of Guise]]. [[Henry IV of France|Henry, the Bourbon King of Navarre]], won the conflict and established the Bourbon dynasty. A burgeoning worldwide [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]] was established in the 16th century. French political power reached a zenith under the rule of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], "The Sun King".

In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the [[French Revolution]]. The country was governed for a period as a [[French First Republic|Republic]], until [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[First French Empire|French Empire]] was declared. Following his defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a [[Bourbon Restoration in France|monarchy]], then briefly as a [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and then as a [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], until a more lasting [[French Third Republic]] was established in 1870.

France was one of the [[Triple Entente]] powers in [[France in World War I|World War I]] against [[Germany in World War I|Germany]] and the [[Central Powers]]. France was one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in [[France in World War II|World War II]], but was conquered by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by Germany while the south was controlled until 1942 by the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. Living conditions were harsh as Germany drained away food and manpower, and many [[The Holocaust in France|Jews were killed]]. The [[Free France]] movement that took over the colonial empire, and coordinated the [[French Resistance|wartime Resistance]]. Following [[liberation of France|liberation]] in 1944, the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was established. France slowly recovered, and enjoyed a [[baby boom]] that reversed its very low fertility rate. Long wars in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and [[Algerian War|Algeria]] drained French resources and ended in political defeat. In the wake of the [[May 1958 crisis|1958 Algerian Crisis]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] set up the [[French Fifth Republic]]. Into the 1960s [[decolonization]] saw most of the [[French colonial empire]] become independent, while smaller parts were incorporated into the French state as [[overseas department]]s and [[overseas collectivities|collectivities]]. Since World War II France has been a permanent member in the [[UN Security Council]] and [[NATO]]. It played a central role in the unification process after 1945 that led to the [[European Union]]. Despite slow economic growth in recent years, it remains a [[Great Power|strong economic, cultural, military and political factor]] in the 21st century.

Stone tools discovered at [[Chilhac]] (1968) and [[Lézignan-la-Cèbe]] in 2009 indicate that pre-human ancestors may have been present in France at least 1.6 million years ago.&lt;ref name="anthropology1"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Tim |date=2009-12-17 |title=Lithic Assemblage Dated to 1.57 Million Years Found at Lézignan-la-Cébe, Southern France |url=http://anthropology.net/2009/12/16/lithic-assemblage-dated-to-1-57-million-years-found-at-lezignan-la-cebe-southern-france/ |access-date=21 June 2012 |publisher=Anthropology.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaul===
{{Main|Gaul}}
[[File:Celtic expansion in Europe.png|thumb|[[Celts|Celtic]] expansion in Europe, 6th–3rd century BC]]

Covering large parts of modern-day France, Belgium, northwest Germany and northern Italy, Gaul was inhabited by many [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Belgae]] tribes whom the Romans referred to as [[Gauls]] and who spoke the [[Gaulish language]] roughly between the [[Oise (river)|Oise]] and the [[Garonne]] (''Gallia Celtica''), according to [[Julius Caesar]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} On the lower Garonne the people spoke [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European language]] related to (or a direct ancestor of) [[Basque language|Basque]] whereas a [[Belgian language]] was spoken north of [[Lutecia]] but north of the [[Loire]] according to other authors like [[Strabo]]. The Celts founded cities such as [[Lutetia|Lutetia Parisiorum]] (Paris) and [[Bordeaux|Burdigala]] (Bordeaux) while the Aquitanians founded [[Toulouse|Tolosa]] (Toulouse).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Long before any Roman settlements, Greek navigators settled in what would become [[Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Provence |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Provence-region-France |access-date=19 January 2017 |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phocaea|Phoceans]] founded important cities such as [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille) and [[Nice|Nikaia]] (Nice), bringing them into conflict with the neighboring Celts and Ligurians. Some Phocean great navigators, such as [[Pytheas]], were born in Marseille. The Celts themselves often fought with Aquitanians and Germans, and a Gaulish war band led by [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] invaded Rome c. 393 or 388 BC following the [[Battle of the Allia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

However, the tribal society of the Gauls did not change fast enough for the centralized Roman state, who would learn to counter them. The Gaulish tribal confederacies were then defeated by the Romans in battles such as [[Battle of Sentinum|Sentinum]] and [[Battle of Telamon|Telamon]] during the 3rd century BC.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In the early 3rd century BC, some Belgae ([[Germani cisrhenani]]) conquered the surrounding territories of the [[river Somme|Somme]] in northern Gaul after battles supposedly against the [[Armoricani]] (Gauls) near [[Ribemont-sur-Ancre]] and [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]], where sanctuaries were found.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

When [[Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginian]] commander [[Hannibal|Hannibal Barca]] fought the Romans, he recruited several Gaulish mercenaries who fought on his side at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. It was this Gaulish participation that caused Provence to be annexed in 122 BC by the [[Roman Republic]].{{Sfnp|Jones|Ladurie|1999|pp=29–30}} Later, the Consul of Gaul — [[Julius Caesar]] — conquered all of Gaul. Despite Gaulish opposition led by [[Vercingetorix]], the Gauls succumbed to the Roman onslaught. The Gauls had some success at first at [[Battle of Gergovia|Gergovia]], but were ultimately [[Battle of Alesia|defeated at Alesia]] in 52 BC. The Romans founded cities such as [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]), [[Narbonne|Narbonensis]] (Narbonne) and allow in a correspondence between [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]] and [[Cicero]] to formalize the existence of [[Cularo]] (Grenoble).&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Familiares'', 10, 23 [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/orateurs/lettres18.htm read on line lettre 876]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Gaul===
{{Main|Roman Gaul}}
[[File:Siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg|thumb|''[[Vercingetorix]] throws down his arms at the feet of [[Julius Caesar]]'' after the [[Battle of Alesia]]. Painting by Lionel-Noël Royer, 1899.]]
Gaul was divided into several different provinces. The Romans displaced populations to prevent local identities from becoming a threat to Roman control. Thus, many Celts were displaced in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]] or were enslaved and moved out of Gaul. There was a strong cultural evolution in Gaul under the Roman Empire, the most obvious one being the replacement of the [[Gaulish language]] by [[Vulgar Latin]]. It has been argued the similarities between the Gaulish and [[Latin]] languages favoured the transition. Gaul remained under Roman control for centuries and Celtic culture was then gradually replaced by [[Gallo-Roman culture]].

The Gauls became better integrated with the Empire with the passage of time. For instance, generals [[Marcus Antonius Primus]] and [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] were both born in Gaul, as were emperors [[Claudius]] and [[Caracalla]]. Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] also came from a Gaulish family. In the decade following [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]'s capture by the Persians in 260, [[Postumus]] established a short-lived [[Gallic Empire]], which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the [[Franks]] and the [[Alamanni]], entered Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s [[Battle of Châlons (274)|victory at Châlons]] in 274.

A migration of Celts appeared in the 4th century in [[Armorica]]. They were led by the legendary king [[Conan Meriadoc]] and came from Britain. They spoke the now extinct [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], which evolved into the [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Welsh language]]s.

In 418 the Aquitanian province was given to the [[Goths]] in exchange for their support against the [[Vandals]]. Those same Goths had sacked Rome in 410 and established a capital in Toulouse.

[[File:Gaul Soldiers.JPG|thumb|Gaulish soldiers (Larousse Illustre 1898)]]
The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and [[Flavius Aëtius]] had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control.
He first used the [[Huns]] against the [[Burgundians]], and these mercenaries destroyed [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], killed king [[Gunther]], and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near [[Lugdunum]] in 443. The Huns, united by [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the [[Battle of Châlons]], in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila.

The Roman Empire was on the verge of collapsing. Aquitania was definitely abandoned to the [[Visigoths]], who would soon conquer a significant part of southern Gaul as well as most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Burgundians claimed their own kingdom, and northern Gaul was practically abandoned to the Franks. Aside from the Germanic peoples, the [[Vascones]] entered [[Duchy of Vasconia|Wasconia]] from the Pyrenees and the [[Bretons]] formed three kingdoms in Armorica: [[Domnonia]], [[Cornouaille]] and [[Broërec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heather |first=P.

==Frankish kingdoms (486–987)==
{{Main|Francia}}
{{See also|List of Frankish kings|Merovingian|Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty|Early Middle Ages}}

[[File:Steuben - Bataille de Poitiers.png|thumb|Victory over the Umayyads at the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) marked the furthest Muslim advance and enabled Frankish domination of Europe for the next century.]]
In 486, [[Clovis I]], leader of the [[Salian Franks]], defeated [[Syagrius]] at [[Battle of Soissons (486)|Soissons]] and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the [[Alamanni]] at [[Battle of Tolbiac|Tolbiac]]. In 496, [[pagan]] Clovis adopted [[Catholicism]]. This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the [[Arian]] Visigoths. He defeated [[Alaric II]] at [[Battle of Vouillé|Vouillé]] in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Cite book |last=James |first=Edward |title=The Franks |date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goths retired to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the [[Merovingian Dynasty]] but his kingdom would not survive his death in 511. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons inherit part of the land, so four kingdoms emerged: centered on [[Paris]], [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Rheims]]. Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were fluid and changed frequently. Also during this time, the [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]], originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

By this time [[Muslim]]s had [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered Hispania]] and [[Septimania]] became part of the Al-Andalus, which were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke [[Odo the Great]] defeated a major invading force at [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Toulouse]] in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated that raiding party at the [[Battle of Tours]] and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by [[Pepin the Short]] (son of Charles Martel) established the [[Carolingian dynasty]] as the Kings of the Franks.

[[File:Sacre de Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Charlemagne]] (painting by [[Jean Fouquet]])]]
Carolingian power reached its fullest extent under Pepin's son, [[Charlemagne]]. In 771, Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the [[Lombards]] under [[Desiderius]] in what is now northern Italy (774), incorporating [[History of Bavaria#Bavaria and the Agilolfings under Frankish overlordship|Bavaria]] (788) into his realm, defeating the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] of the [[Danube|Danubian]] plain (796), advancing the frontier with [[Al-Andalus]] as far south as [[Barcelona]] (801), and subjugating [[Lower Saxony]] after a prolonged campaign (804).

In recognition of his successes and his political support for the [[Papacy]], [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800. Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious]] (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I's death. Two of his sons — [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Louis the German]] — swore allegiance to each other against their brother — [[Lothair I]] — in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]], and the empire was divided among Louis's three sons ([[Treaty of Verdun]], 843). After a last brief reunification (884–887), the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm, which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of [[Henry the Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Derek |title=Charlemagne |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Carolingian]]s, the kingdom was ravaged by [[Siege of Paris (885-886)|Viking raiders]]. In this struggle some important figures such as [[Odo, Count of Paris|Count Odo of Paris]] and his brother [[Robert I of France|King Robert]] rose to fame and became kings. This emerging dynasty, whose members were called the [[Robertian dynasty|Robertines]], were the predecessors of the [[Capetian Dynasty]]. Led by [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], some Vikings had settled in Normandy and were granted the land, first as counts and then as dukes, by King [[Charles the Simple]], in order to protect the land from other raiders. The people that emerged from the interactions between the new Viking aristocracy and the already mixed Franks and Gallo-Romans became known as the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Van Houts |first=Elisabeth M.

===Strong princes===
France was a very decentralised state during the [[Middle Ages]]. The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like [[Normandy]], [[Flanders]] or [[Languedoc]] enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The [[House of Capet|Capetians]], as they were descended from the [[Robertians]], were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate [[Carolingian]] kings.{{Sfnp|Duby|1993}}

The [[Carolingian]] kings had nothing more than a royal title when the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the [[Crown of Charlemagne]] and as [[Count of Paris]] they held their personal fiefdom, best known as [[Île-de-France]].{{Sfnp|Duby|1993}}

The fact that the Capetians held lands as both Prince and King gave them a complicated status. They were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes, but they also had a religious authority over [[Roman Catholicism in France]] as King. The Capetian kings treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates: their royal title was recognised yet frequently disrespected. Capetian authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power.{{Sfnp|Duby|1993}}

Some of the king's vassals would grow sufficiently powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The [[Normans]], the [[Plantagenets]], the [[Lusignans]], the [[Hautevilles]], the [[Ramnulfids]], and the House of [[Counts of Toulouse|Toulouse]] successfully carved lands outside France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the [[Norman Conquest]] by [[William the Conqueror]], following the [[Battle of Hastings]] and immortalised in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carpenter |first=David |title=The Struggle for Mastery. The Penguin history of Britain 1066–1284 |page=91 |quote=In the first place, after 1072 William was largely an absentee. Of the 170 months remaining of his reign he spent around 130 in France, returning to England only on four occasions. This was no passing phase. Absentee kings continued to spend at best half their time in England until the loss of Normandy in 1204… But this absenteeism solidified rather than sapped royal government since it engendered structures both to maintain peace and extract money on the king's absence, money which was above all needed across the channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the [[Crusader states]]. An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the [[Krak des Chevaliers]]' enlargement by the Counts of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and [[Toulouse]].

===Rise of the monarchy===
The monarchy overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328, and the laws of [[primogeniture]] ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the [[Papacy, history|Church]], which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The [[First Crusade]] was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on, the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles.&lt;ref name="google235" /&gt;

The history of France starts with the election of [[Hugh Capet]] (940–996) by an assembly summoned in [[Reims]] in 987. Capet had been "Duke of the Franks" and then became "King of the Franks" (Rex Francorum). Hugh's lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; his political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the king's vassals (who included for a long time the kings of England) ruled over territories far greater than his own.&lt;ref name="google235"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Marvin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMKpq_nV0J8C&amp;pg=PA235 |title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society: To 1789 |last2=Jacob |first2=Margaret |date=2008 |isbn=978-0547147420 |page=235 |display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recorded to be recognised king by the [[Gauls]], [[Bretons]], [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Aquitanians]], [[Goths]], Spanish and [[Gascons]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Medieval France: An Encyclopedia |date=1995 |editor-last=Kibler |editor-first=William W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Count Borell of Barcelona]] called for Hugh's help against Islamic raids, but even if Hugh intended to help Borell, he was otherwise occupied in fighting [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]]. The loss of other Spanish principalities then followed, as the Spanish marches grew more and more independent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995" /&gt; Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king, is not a well documented figure, his greatest achievement being certainly to survive as king and defeating the Carolingian claimant, thus allowing him to establish what would become one of Europe's most powerful house of kings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995" /&gt;

[[File:Clocher abbaye cluny 2.JPG|thumb|A view of the remains of the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]], a [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery that was the centre of monastic life revival in the [[Middle Ages]] and marked an important step in the cultural rebirth following the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].]]
Hugh's son—[[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]]—was crowned King of the Franks before Capet's demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each other's realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. Although a king weak in power, Robert II's efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he relied heavily on the Church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress—[[Bertha of Burgundy]]—and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks (hence his nickname, Robert the Pious).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995" /&gt; The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the [[Peace and Truce of God]] (beginning in 989) and the [[Cluniac Reforms]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995" /&gt;

[[File:Godfrey of Bouillon, holding a pollaxe. (Manta Castle, Cuneo, Italy).jpg|thumb|[[Godfrey of Bouillon|Godefroy de Bouillon]], a French knight, leader of the [[First Crusade]] and founder of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]]]
Under [[Philip I of France|King Philip I]], the kingdom enjoyed a modest recovery during his extraordinarily long reign (1060–1108). His reign also saw the launch of the [[First Crusade]] to regain the [[Holy Land]], which heavily involved his family although he personally did not support the expedition.

It is from [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] (reigned 1108–37) onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward Louis had the assistance of a skilled religious statesman, [[Abbot Suger]]. The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s. Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995" /&gt;

Thanks to Abbot Suger's political advice, [[Louis VII of France|King Louis VII]] (junior king 1131–37, senior king 1137–80) enjoyed greater [[moral authority]] over France than his predecessors. Powerful vassals paid homage to the French king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hallam |first=Elizabeth M. |title=Capetian France 987-1328 |date=1980 |isbn=9780582489097 |page=64 |quote=Then, in 1151, Henry Plantagenet paid homage for the duchy to Louis VII in Paris, homage he repeated as king of England in 1156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot Suger arranged the 1137 marriage between Louis VII and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in Bordeaux, which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in [[Vitry-en-Perthois|Vitry]] during the conflict against the Count of Champagne.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Frankl |first=Paul |title=Gothic Architecture |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the [[Holy Land]]. He later involved the Kingdom of France in the [[Second Crusade]] but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy — [[Henry II of England|Henry Fitzempress]], who would become King of England as Henry II two years later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine.

Abbot Suger's vision of construction became what is now known as [[Gothic architecture]]. This style became standard for most European cathedrals built in the [[late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

===Late Capetians (1165–1328)===
The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor.

====Philip II Augustus====
The reign of [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] (junior king 1179–80, senior king 1180–1223) marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair.

[[File:Bataille de Bouvines gagnee par Philippe Auguste.jpg|thumb|[[Philip II of France|Philip II]] victorious at [[Bouvines]] thus annexing Normandy and Anjou into his royal domains. This battle involved a complex set of alliances from three important states, the Kingdoms of France and England and the Holy Roman Empire.]]
Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called [[Angevin Empire]], which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of England's son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II—[[Richard I of England|Richard Lionheart]]—and together they launched a decisive attack on Henry's castle and home of [[Chinon]] and removed him from power.

Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the [[Third Crusade]]; however, their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France until Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II.

Adding to their battles in France, the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. If Philip II Augustus supported [[Philip of Swabia]], member of the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], then Richard Lionheart supported [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]], member of the [[House of Welf]]. Otto IV had the upper hand and became the Holy Roman Emperor at the expense of Philip of Swabia. The crown of France was saved by Richard's demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]].

[[John of England|John Lackland]], Richard's successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the [[Lusignan]]s and, as Louis VI had done often to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated John's possessions in France. John's defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the decisive [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214) resulted in complete failure. Philip II had annexed Normandy and Anjou, plus capturing the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders, although Aquitaine and Gascony remained loyal to the Plantagenet King. In an additional aftermath of the [[Battle of Bouvines]], John's ally Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto IV]] was overthrown by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], member of the House of Hohenstaufen and ally of Philip. Philip II of France was crucial in ordering Western European politics in both England and France.

Philip Augustus founded [[La Sorbonne|the Sorbonne]] and made Paris a city for scholars.

[[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] (the future Louis VIII, reigned 1223–26) was involved in the subsequent [[First Barons War|English civil war]] as French and English (or rather Anglo-Norman) aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains.

====Saint Louis (1226–1270)====
France became a truly centralised kingdom under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (reigned 1226–70). Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one-dimensional character, a flawless example of the faith and an administrative reformer who cared for the governed. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone: he made unsuccessful crusades, his expanding administrations raised opposition, and he burned Jewish books at the Pope's urging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gigot |first=Francis E. |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1910 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |volume=VIII |location=New York |chapter=Judaism |access-date=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis' vassals:{{sfnp|Hallam|1980|p=265}}

{{Blockquote|For it would be against God and contrary to right and justice if he compelled any man to seek absolution when the clergy were doing him wrong.}}

Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France. His mother — [[Blanche of Castile]] — was the effective power as [[regent]] (although she did not formally use the title). Blanche's authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she maintained her position until Louis was old enough to rule by himself.

In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long lasting [[University of Paris strike of 1229|strike at the University of Paris]]. The [[Latin Quarter|Quartier Latin]] was strongly hit by these strikes.

The kingdom was vulnerable: war was still going on in the County of Toulouse, and the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc. [[Raymond VII of Toulouse|Count Raymond VII of Toulouse]] finally signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands for life, but his daughter, married to [[Alfonso, Count of Poitou|Count Alfonso of Poitou]], produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France.

[[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]] had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at [[Saint-Malo]] with a massive force. Henry III's allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king, who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the [[Saintonge War]] (1242).

Ultimately, Henry III was defeated and had to recognise Louis IX's overlordship, although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The [[Conseil du Roi]], which would evolve into the [[Parlement]], was founded in these times. After his conflict with [[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]], Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King.{{sfnp|Hallam|1980|p=264}}

Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as [[Gothic architecture]]; his [[Sainte-Chapelle]] became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the [[Morgan Bible]]. The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the [[Seventh Crusade]] and the [[Eighth Crusade]]. Both proved to be complete failures for the French King.

====Philip III and Philip IV (1270–1314)====
[[Philip III of France|Philip III]] became king when Saint Louis died in 1270 during the Eighth Crusade. Philip III was called "the Bold" on the basis of his abilities in combat and on horseback, and not because of his character or ruling abilities. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the [[Aragonese Crusade]], which cost him his life in 1285.

More administrative reforms were made by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], also called Philip the Fair (reigned 1285–1314). This king was responsible for the end of the [[Knights Templar]], signed the [[Auld Alliance]], and established the [[Parlement|Parlement of Paris]]. Philip IV was so powerful that he could name popes and emperors, unlike the early Capetians. The papacy was moved to [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] and all the contemporary popes were French, such as Philip IV's puppet [[Pope Clement V|Bertrand de Goth, Pope Clement V]].

===Early Valois Kings and the Hundred Years' War (1328–1453)===
[[File:Capture Jean II.jpg|thumb|The capture of the French king [[John II of France|John II]] at [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] in 1356]]
The tensions between the Houses of [[Plantagenet]] and [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] climaxed during the so-called [[Hundred Years' War]] (actually several distinct wars over the period 1337 to 1453) when the Plantagenets claimed the throne of France from the Valois. This was also the time of the [[Black Death]], as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 by the [[Treaty of Troyes]] [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] was made heir to Charles VI. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the Dual-Monarchy of England and France.

It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years' War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by [[Joan of Arc]] (1412–1431). Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years' War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily.

Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at the [[Battle of Baugé]] (1421), the humiliating defeats of [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] (1356) and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] (1415) forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army. [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] (reigned 1422–61) established the first French standing army, the [[Compagnies d'ordonnance]], and defeated the Plantagenets once at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] (1429) and again, using cannons, at [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] (1450). The [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) was the last engagement of this war; [[Calais]] and the [[Channel Islands]] remained ruled by the Plantagenets.

===Life in the Early Modern period===
{{Main|Ancien Régime}}

====French identity====
France in the [[Ancien Régime]] covered a territory of around {{convert|520000|km2|sqmi}}. This land supported 13 million people in 1484 and 20 million people in 1700. France had the second largest population in Europe around 1700. Britain had 5 million, Spain had 8 million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around 8 million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. France's lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goubert |first=Pierre |title=The Ancien Régime |date=1973 |pages=2–9 |author-link=Pierre Goubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sense of "being French" was uncommon in 1500, as people clung to their local identities. By 1600, however, people were starting to call themselves "bon françois."&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt;

====Estates and power====
Political power was widely dispersed. The law courts ("Parlements") were powerful, especially that of France. However, the king had only about 10,000 officials in royal service – very few indeed for such a large country, and with very slow internal communications over an inadequate road system. Travel was usually faster by ocean ship or river boat.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; The different [[estates of the realm]] — the clergy, the nobility, and commoners — occasionally met together in the "[[Estates General (France)|Estates General]]", but in practice the Estates General had no power, for it could petition the king but could not pass laws.

[[Catholic Church in France|The Catholic Church]] controlled about 40% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king (not the pope) nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments.

The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity. Each noble had his own lands, his own network of regional connections, and his own military force.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Baumgartner |first=Frederick J. |title=France in the Sixteenth Century |date=1995 |pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 220,000 people in 1547 and a history of steady growth. Lyon and [[Rouen]] each had about 40,000 population, but [[Lyon#History of Lyon|Lyon]] had a powerful banking community, a vibrant culture and good access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Bordeaux was next with only 20,000 population in 1500.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt;

Peasants made up the vast majority of population, who in many cases had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect. In 1484, about 97% of France's 13 million people lived in rural villages; in 1700, at least 80% of the 20 million people population were peasants.

In the 17th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The "stable" core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal.&lt;ref name="amazon1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=James B. |title=Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-modern France |journal=[[Journal of Social History]] |date=1991 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=563–577 |doi=10.1353/jsh/24.3.563 |jstor=3787815 |issn=0022-4529}} For the ''Annales'' interpretation see {{Cite book |last=Goubert |first=Pierre |title=The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century |date=1986 |author-link=Pierre Goubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive [[Geographic mobility|geographic]] and [[social mobility]] tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the [[social structure]], economy, and even political system of [[early modern France]]. The [[Annales School]] paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability.{{sfnp|Collins|1991|pp=563–577}}{{sfnp|Collins|1995}}

====Language====
{{Main|History of French}}
Although most peasants in France spoke local dialects, an official language emerged in Paris and the [[French language#Modern French|French language]] became the preferred language of Europe's aristocracy and the [[lingua franca]] of diplomacy and international relations. Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500-1558) quipped, "I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Santayana |first1=George |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCobBRiv3_MC&amp;pg=PA299 |title=The letters of George Santayana |last2=Holzberger |first2=William G. |date=31 July 2008 |isbn=978-0-262-19571-3 |volume=1948–1952, Book 8 |page=299 |author-link=George Santayana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its international status, there was a desire to regulate the French language. Several reforms of the French language worked to make it more uniform. The Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]] (? - 1553) helped to shape French as a [[literary language]], Rabelais' French is characterised by the re-introduction of Greek and Latin words. [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] (1517-1582) was one of the scholars who reformed the French language. He improved [[Nicolas Chuquet]]'s [[Long and short scales|long scale]] system by adding names for intermediate numbers ("milliards" instead of "thousand million", etc.).

===Consolidation (15th and 16th centuries)===
[[File:Weyden Karl der Kuehne.jpg|thumb|[[Charles the Bold]], the last Valois [[Duke of Burgundy]]. His death at the [[Battle of Nancy]] (1477) marked the division of his lands between the Kings of France and Habsburg Dynasty.]]
With the death in 1477 of [[Charles the Bold]], France and the Habsburgs began a long process of dividing his rich Burgundian lands, leading to numerous wars. In 1532, Brittany was [[Union between Brittany and France|incorporated]] into the Kingdom of France.

France engaged in the long [[Italian Wars]] (1494–1559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] faced powerful foes, and he was captured at [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]. The French monarchy then sought for allies and found one in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Ottoman Admiral Barbarossa]] captured Nice in 1543 and handed it down to Francis I.

During the 16th century, the Spanish and Austrian [[Habsburgs]] were the dominant power in Europe. The many domains of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] encircled France. The [[Tercio|Spanish Tercio]] was used with great success against French knights. Finally, on 7 January 1558, the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] seized Calais from the English.

===="Beautiful 16th century"====
Economic historians call the era from about 1475 to 1630 the "beautiful 16th century" because of the return of peace, prosperity and optimism across the nation, and the steady growth of population. [[Paris]], for example, flourished as never before, as its population rose to 200,000 by 1550. In [[Toulouse]] the [[Renaissance]] of the 16th century brought wealth that transformed the architecture of the town, such as building of the great aristocratic houses.{{Sfnp|Goubert|1988|pp=127–134}} In 1559, [[Henri II of France]] signed (with the approval of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]]) [[Italian War of 1551–1559#Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559)|two treaties (''Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis'')]]: one with [[Elizabeth I of England]] and one with [[Philip II of Spain]]. This ended long-lasting conflicts between France, England and Spain.

===Protestant Huguenots and wars of religion (1562–1629)===
{{Main|French Wars of Religion}}
[[File:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|[[Henry IV of France]] was the first French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation]], inspired in France mainly by [[John Calvin]], began to challenge the legitimacy and rituals of the [[Catholic Church in France#Renaissance Church and Protestantism|Catholic Church]]. It reached an elite audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wernham |first=R. B. |title=The New Cambridge Modern History |date=1968 |isbn=9780521045438 |volume=3 |pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin, based securely in Geneva, Switzerland, was a Frenchman deeply committed to reforming his homeland. The Protestant movement had been energetic, but lacked central organizational direction. With financial support from the church in Geneva, Calvin turned his enormous energies toward uplifting the French Protestant cause. As one historian explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He supplied the dogma, the liturgy, and the moral ideas of the new religion, and he also created ecclesiastical, political, and social institutions in harmony with it. A born leader, he followed up his work with personal appeals. His vast correspondence with French Protestants shows not only much zeal but infinite pains and considerable tact and driving home the lessons of his printed treatises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Preserved |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.226293 |title=The Age of the Reformation |date=1920 |isbn=9781505251975 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.226293/page/n207 201]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1555 and 1562, more than 100 ministers were sent to France. Nevertheless, French King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] severely persecuted Protestants under the [[Edict of Chateaubriand]] (1551) and when the French authorities complained about the missionary activities, the city fathers of Geneva disclaimed official responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parker |first=T.H.L. |title=John Calvin: A Biography |date=2006 |isbn=9780745952284 |pages=161–164 |orig-date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main Calvinist strongholds were southwest France and Normandy, but even in these districts the Catholics were a majority. Renewed Catholic reaction — headed by the powerful [[Francis, Duke of Guise]] — led to a massacre of Huguenots at [[Wassy|Vassy]] in 1562, starting the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]], during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant ("Huguenot") and Catholic forces.

King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] died in 1559 in a jousting tournament; he was succeeded in turn by his three sons, each of which assumed the throne as minors or were weak, ineffectual rulers. In the power vacuum entered Henry's widow, [[Catherine de' Medici]], who became a central figure in the early years of the Wars of Religion. She is often blamed for the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, when thousands of Huguenots were murdered in Paris and the provinces of France.

The Wars of Religion culminated in the [[War of the Three Henrys]] (1584–98), at the height of which bodyguards of the King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] assassinated [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry de Guise]], leader of the Spanish-backed [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic league]], in December 1588. In revenge, a priest assassinated Henry III in 1589. This led to the ascension of the Huguenot [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; in order to bring peace to a country beset by religious and succession wars, he converted to Catholicism. "Paris is worth a Mass," he reputedly said. He issued the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598, which guaranteed religious liberties to the Protestants, thereby effectively ending the civil war.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Holt |first=Mack P. |title=The French Wars of Religion, 1562–1629 |date=2005 |isbn=9781139447676 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main provisions of the [[Edict of Nantes]] were as follows: a) Huguenots were allowed to hold religious services in certain towns in each province, b) They were allowed to control and fortify eight cities (including [[La Rochelle]] and [[Montauban]]), c) Special courts were established to try Huguenot offenders, d) Huguenots were to have equal civil rights with the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Finley-Croswhite |first=S.

Henry IV was assassinated in 1610 by [[François Ravaillac|a fanatical Catholic]].

When in 1620 the Huguenots proclaimed a constitution for the 'Republic of the Reformed Churches of France', the chief minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (1585–1642) invoked the entire powers of the state to stop it. Religious conflicts therefore resumed under [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] when Richelieu forced Protestants to disarm their army and fortresses. This conflict ended in the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] (1627–28), in which Protestants and their English supporters were defeated. The following [[Peace of Alais]] (1629) confirmed religious freedom yet dismantled the Protestant military defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Elliott |first=J.

===Thirty Years' War (1618–1648)===
{{Main|Thirty Years' War}}
The religious conflicts that plagued France also ravaged the Habsburg-led Holy Roman Empire. The Thirty Years' War eroded the power of the Catholic Habsburgs. Although [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the powerful chief minister of France, had mauled the Protestants, he joined this war on their side in 1636 because it was in the [[National interest|''raison d'État'' (national interest)]]. Imperial Habsburg forces invaded France, ravaged [[Champagne, France|Champagne]], and nearly threatened Paris.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Peter H. |title=Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years' War |date=2009 |isbn=9780674036345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richelieu died in 1642 and was succeeded by [[Cardinal Mazarin]], while Louis XIII died one year later and was succeeded by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. France was served by some very efficient commanders such as [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé|Louis II de Bourbon]] (Condé) and [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne]] (Turenne). The French forces won a decisive victory at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] (1643), and the Spanish army was decimated; the Tercio was broken. The [[Truce of Ulm (1647)]] and the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) brought an end to the war.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

Some challenges remained. France was hit by civil unrest known as the [[Fronde]] which in turn evolved into the [[Franco-Spanish War (1653)|Franco-Spanish War]] in 1653. Louis II de Bourbon joined the Spanish army this time, but suffered a severe defeat at [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Dunkirk]] (1658) by Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne. The terms for the peace inflicted upon the Spanish kingdoms in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) were harsh, as France annexed Northern Catalonia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

Amidst this turmoil, [[René Descartes]] sought answers to philosophical questions through the use of logic and reason and formulated what would be called [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian Dualism]] in 1641.

===Colonies (16th and 17th centuries)===
{{Main|French colonial empire}}
During the 16th century, the king began to claim North American territories and [[French colonization of the Americas|established several colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hodson |first1=Christopher |last2=Rushforth |first2=Brett |date=January 2010 |title=Absolutely Atlantic: Colonialism and the Early Modern French State in Recent Historiography |journal=[[History Compass]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=101–117 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2009.00635.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Cartier]] was one of the great explorers who ventured deep into American territories during the 16th century.

===Louis XIV (1643–1715)===
{{Main|Louis XIV of France}}

[[File:Ruiterportret Lodewijk XIV.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV of France]], the "Sun King"]]
[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], known as the "Sun King", reigned over France from 1643 until 1715 although his strongest period of personal rule did not begin until 1661 after the death of his Italian chief minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. Louis believed in the [[divine right of kings]], which asserts that a monarch is above everyone except God, and is therefore not answerable to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or the Church. Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from Paris, sought to eliminate remnants of feudalism in France, and subjugated and weakened the aristocracy. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution. However, Louis XIV's long reign saw France involved in many wars that drained its treasury.&lt;ref name="iearn1"&gt;[http://www.iearn.hu/balkans/bpeople/zrinyi.htm Count Miklós Zrínyi, the Poet-Warlord] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103204905/http://www.iearn.hu/balkans/bpeople/zrinyi.htm |date=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His reign began during the Thirty Years' War and during the Franco-Spanish war. His military architect, [[Vauban]], became famous for his pentagonal fortresses, and [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] supported the royal spending as much as possible. French dominated [[League of the Rhine]] fought against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|Battle of Saint Gotthard]] in 1664. The battle was won by the Christians, chiefly through the brave attack of 6,000 French troops led by [[François d'Aubusson de La Feuillade|La Feuillade]] and [[Jean de Coligny-Saligny|Coligny]].&lt;ref name="iearn1" /&gt;

France fought the [[War of Devolution]] against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] in 1667. France's defeat of Spain and invasion of the Spanish Netherlands alarmed England and Sweden. With the [[Dutch Republic]] they formed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] to check Louis XIV's expansion. Louis II de Bourbon had captured [[Franche-Comté]], but in face of an indefensible position, Louis XIV agreed to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|peace of Aachen]]. Under its terms, Louis XIV did not annex Franche-Comté but did gain [[Lille]].{{Sfn|Wolf|1968}}

Peace was fragile, and war broke out again between France and the Dutch Republic in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78). Louis XIV asked for the Dutch Republic to resume war against the Spanish Netherlands, but the republic refused. France attacked the Dutch Republic and was joined by England in this conflict. Through targeted inundations of [[polder]]s by breaking dykes, the French invasion of the Dutch Republic was brought to a halt.&lt;ref name="autogenerated706"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ó Gráda |first1=Cormac |last2=Chevet, Jean-Michel |date=2002 |title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient Régime'' France |url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/368/3/ogradac_article_pub_039.pdf |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=706–733 |doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055 |pmid=17494233 |hdl=10197/368 |s2cid=8036361|hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] inflicted a few strategic defeats on the Anglo-French naval alliance and forced [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|England to retire from the war]] in 1674. Because the Netherlands could not resist indefinitely, it agreed to peace in the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]], according to which France would annex France-Comté and acquire further concessions in the Spanish Netherlands.

On 6 May 1682, the royal court moved to the lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], which Louis XIV had greatly expanded. Over time, Louis XIV compelled many members of the nobility, especially the noble elite, to inhabit Versailles. He controlled the nobility with an elaborate system of pensions and privileges, and replaced their power with himself.

Peace did not last, and war between France and Spain again resumed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated706" /&gt; The [[War of the Reunions]] broke out (1683–84), and again Spain, with its ally the Holy Roman Empire, was defeated. Meanwhile, in October 1685 Louis signed the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] ordering the destruction of all Protestant churches and schools in France. Its immediate consequence was a large Protestant exodus from France. Over two million people died in two famines in 1693 and 1710.&lt;ref name="autogenerated706" /&gt;

France would soon be involved in another war, the [[War of the Grand Alliance]]. This time the theatre was not only in Europe but also in North America. Although the war was long and difficult (it was also called the Nine Years' War), its results were inconclusive. The [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697 confirmed French sovereignty over [[Alsace]], yet rejected its claims to [[Luxembourg]]. Louis also had to evacuate [[Catalonia]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]]. This peace was considered a truce by all sides, thus war was to start again.{{Sfn|Wolf|1968}}
[[File:France 1552-1798.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The expansion of France, 1552 to 1798]]
In 1701 the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began. The Bourbon [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]] was designated heir to the throne of Spain as Philip V. The Habsburg [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] opposed a Bourbon succession, because the power that such a succession would bring to the Bourbon rulers of France would disturb the delicate [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe. Therefore, he claimed the Spanish thrones for himself.{{Sfn|Wolf|1968}} England and the Dutch Republic joined Leopold against Louis XIV and Philip of Anjou. The allied forces were led by [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], and by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. They inflicted a few resounding defeats on the French army; the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704 was the first major land battle lost by France since its victory at Rocroi in 1643. Yet, the extremely bloody battles of [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] (1706) and [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] (1709) proved to be [[Pyrrhic victory|Pyrrhic victories]] for the allies, as they had lost too many men to continue the war.{{Sfn|Wolf|1968}} Led by [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Villars]], French forces recovered much of the lost ground in battles such as [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] (1712). Finally, a compromise was achieved with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Philip of Anjou was confirmed as Philip V, king of Spain; Emperor Leopold did not get the throne, but Philip V was barred from inheriting France.{{Sfn|Wolf|1968}}

Louis XIV wanted to be remembered as a patron of the arts, like his ancestor Louis IX. He invited [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] to establish the [[French opera]], and a tumultuous friendship was established between Lully and playwright and actor [[Molière]]. [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] became France's most important architect of the period, bringing the pinnacle of [[French Baroque architecture]].

The wars were so expensive, and so inconclusive, that although France gained some territory to the east, its enemies gained more strength than it did. Vauban, France's leading military strategist, warned the King in 1689 that a hostile "Alliance" was too powerful at sea. He recommended the best way for France to fight back was to license French merchants ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships, while avoiding its navies:
{{Blockquote|
France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its [[Spanish Empire|dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America]]; the [[Duchy of Savoy]], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments. France has… undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile hostile and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France's enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism, 1618–1763 |date=1974 |isbn=9780333166338 |editor-last=Simcox |editor-first=Geoffrey |pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vauban was pessimistic about France's so-called friends and allies and recommended against expensive land wars, or hopeless naval wars:
{{Blockquote|For lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [James II] expelled from his country [And living in exile in Paris]; the grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Mokena, and Parma (all in Italy); and the other faction of the Swiss. Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections….The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to… Allies…. We must therefore fall back on [[privateer]]ing as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing….It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.{{Sfnp|Simcox|1974|pp=237, 242}}}}

===Major changes in France, Europe, and North America (1718–1783)===
{{Main|Seven Years' War}}
{{See also|French colonization of the Americas|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:Battle of Fontenoy 1745 1.PNG|thumb|The [[Battle of Fontenoy]], 11 May 1745]]
Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by his five-year-old great grandson who reigned as [[Louis XV]] until his death in 1774. In 1718, France was once again at war, as [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philip II of Orléans]]'s regency joined the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] against Spain. King [[Philip V of Spain]] had to withdraw from the conflict, confronted with the reality that Spain was no longer a great power in Europe. Under [[André-Hercule de Fleury|Cardinal Fleury]]'s administration, peace was maintained as long as possible.{{Sfnp|Le Roy Ladurie|1999}}

However, in 1733 another war broke in central Europe, this time about the [[War of the Polish Succession|Polish succession]], and France joined the war against the Austrian Empire. This time there was no invasion of the Netherlands, and Britain remained neutral. As a consequence, Austria was left alone against a Franco-Spanish alliance and faced a military disaster. Peace was settled in the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)]], according to which France would annex, through inheritance, the [[Lorraine (duchy)|Duchy of Lorraine]].{{Sfnp|Le Roy Ladurie|1999}}

Two years later, in 1740, war broke out over the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian succession]], and France seized the opportunity to join the conflict. The war played out in North America and India as well as Europe, and inconclusive terms were agreed to in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. Once again, no one regarded this as a peace, but rather as a mere truce. [[Prussia]] was then becoming a new threat, as it had gained substantial territory from Austria. This led to the [[Diplomatic Revolution|Diplomatic Revolution of 1756]], in which the alliances seen during the previous war were mostly inverted. France was now allied to Austria and Russia, while Britain was now allied to Prussia.&lt;ref name="Marston"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Marston |first=Daniel |title=The Seven Years' War |date=2001 |author-link=Daniel Marston (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North American theatre, France was allied with various Native American peoples during the [[Seven Years' War]] and, despite a temporary success at the battles of [[Battle of the Great Meadows|the Great Meadows]] and [[Battle of the Monongahela|Monongahela]], French forces were defeated at the disastrous [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in Quebec. In Europe, repeated French attempts to overwhelm [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] failed. In 1762 Russia, France, and Austria were on the verge of crushing Prussia, when the [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian Alliance]] was saved by the [[Miracle of the House of Brandenburg]]. At sea, naval defeats against British fleets at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]] in 1759 and a crippling blockade forced France to keep its ships in port. Finally peace was concluded in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], and France lost its North American empire.&lt;ref name=Marston/&gt;

[[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's success in the Seven Years' War]] had allowed them to eclipse France as the leading colonial power. France sought revenge for this defeat, and under [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]] France started to rebuild. In 1766 the French Kingdom annexed Lorraine and the following year bought [[History of Corsica|Corsica]] from [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]].

[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] surrenders at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] to American and French allies.]]
Having lost its colonial empire, France saw a good opportunity for revenge against Britain in [[Anglo-French War (1778–83)|signing an alliance with the Americans in 1778, and sending an army and navy]] that turned the [[American Revolution]] into a world war. Spain, allied to France by the [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]], and the Dutch Republic also joined the war on the French side. [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]] defeated a British fleet at [[Battle of the Chesapeake|Chesapeake Bay]] while [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] joined American forces in defeating the British at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]]. The war was concluded by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]; the United States became independent. The British [[Royal Navy]] scored a major victory over France in 1782 at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] and France finished the war with huge debts and the minor gain of the island of [[Tobago]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;Jonathan R.

===French Enlightenment===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|Cover of the [[Encyclopédie]] ]]

The "[[Philosophes]]" were 18th-century French intellectuals who dominated the [[French Enlightenment]] and were influential across Europe. Their interests were diverse, with experts in scientific, literary, philosophical and sociological matters. The ultimate goal of the philosophers was human progress; by concentrating on social and material sciences, they believed that a rational society was the only logical outcome of a freethinking and reasoned populace. They also advocated [[Deism]] and religious tolerance. Many believed religion had been used as a source of conflict since time eternal, and that logical, rational thought was the way forward for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Reill |first1=Peter Hanns |title=Encyclopædia of the Enlightenment |last2=Wilson |first2=Ellen Judy |date=2004 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was editor in chief of the famous Enlightenment accomplishment, the 72,000-article ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–72). It was made possible through a wide, complex network of relationships that maximized their influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Comsa |first=Maria Teodora |date=2016 |title=The French Enlightenment Network |journal=[[Journal of Modern History]] |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=495–534 |doi=10.1086/687927 |display-authors=et al |s2cid=151445740}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sparked a revolution in learning throughout the enlightened world.{{Sfnp|Wilson|1972}}

In the early part of the 18th century the movement was dominated by [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]], but the movement grew in momentum as the century moved on.  The opposition was partly undermined by dissensions within the Catholic Church, the gradual weakening of the absolute monarch and the numerous expensive wars. Thus the influence of the Philosophes spread. Around 1750 they reached their most influential period, as [[Montesquieu]] published ''Spirit of Laws'' (1748) and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] published ''Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences'' (1750).

The leader of the French Enlightenment and a writer of enormous influence across Europe, was [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778). His many books included poems and plays; works of satire (''[[Candide]]'' [1759]); books on history, science, and philosophy, including numerous (anonymous) contributions to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''; and an extensive correspondence. A witty, tireless antagonist to the alliance between the French state and the church, he was exiled from France on a number of occasions. In exile in England he came to appreciate British thought and he popularized [[Isaac Newton]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire |date=2009 |editor-last=Cronk |editor-first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy, chemistry, mathematics and technology flourished. French chemists such as [[Antoine Lavoisier]] worked to replace the archaic units of weights and measures by a coherent scientific system. Lavoisier also formulated the law of [[Conservation of mass]] and discovered oxygen and hydrogen.{{Sfnp|Roche|1998|loc=Ch. 15}}

==Revolutionary France (1789–1799)==
{{Main|French Revolution}}

===Background of the French Revolution===
{{Main|Causes of the French Revolution}}
[[File:Journée des Tuiles (Alexandre Debelle), Musée de la Révolution française - Vizille.jpg|thumb|[[Day of the Tiles]] in 1788 at [[Grenoble]] was the first riot. ([[Musée de la Révolution française]]).]]

When King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] died in 1774 he left his grandson, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], "A heavy legacy, with ruined finances, unhappy subjects, and a faulty and incompetent government." Regardless, "the people, meanwhile, still had confidence in royalty, and the accession of Louis XVI was welcomed with enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;William J Roberts, ''France: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'' (2004) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later, recent wars, especially the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63) and the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), had effectively bankrupted the state. The taxation system was highly inefficient. Several years of bad harvests and an inadequate transportation system had caused rising food prices, hunger, and malnutrition; the country was further destabilized by the lower classes' increased feeling that the royal court was isolated from, and indifferent to, their hardships.

In February 1787, the king's finance minister, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], convened an [[Assembly of Notables]], a group of nobles, clergy, [[bourgeoisie]], and bureaucrats selected in order to bypass the local parliaments. This group was asked to approve a new [[land tax]] that would, for the first time, include a tax on the property of nobles and clergy. The assembly did not approve the tax, and instead demanded that Louis XVI call the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]].

[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|The [[Tennis Court Oath]] of 20 June 1789 was a pivotal event during the first days of the Revolution. It signified the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI.]]

===National Assembly, Paris anarchy and storming the Bastille (January–14 July 1789)===
In August 1788, the King agreed to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General in May 1789]]. While the Third Estate demanded and was granted "double representation" so as to balance the First and Second Estate, voting was to occur "by orders" — votes of the Third Estate were to be weighted — effectively canceling double representation. This eventually led to the Third Estate breaking away from the Estates-General and, joined by members of the other estates, proclaiming the creation of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the Estates but of "the People."

In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met. After finding the door to their chamber locked and guarded, the Assembly met nearby on a tennis court and pledged the [[Tennis Court Oath]] on 20 June 1789, binding them "never to separate, and to meet wherever circumstances demand, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and affirmed on solid foundations." They were joined by some sympathetic members of the Second and First estates. After the king fired his finance minister, [[Jacques Necker]], for giving his support and guidance to the Third Estate, worries surfaced that the legitimacy of the newly formed National Assembly might be threatened by royalists.

[[File:Anonymous - Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|The [[Storming of the Bastille]], 14 July 1789]]
Paris was soon in a state of anarchy. It was consumed with riots and widespread looting. Because the royal leadership essentially abandoned the city, the mobs soon had the support of the French Guard, including arms and trained soldiers. On 14 July 1789, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress, which also served as a symbol of royal tyranny. Insurgents [[Storming of the Bastille|seized the Bastille prison]], killing the governor and several of his guards. The French now [[Bastille Day|celebrate 14 July each year as 'Bastille day' or, as the French say: ''Quatorze Juillet (the Fourteenth of July)'']], as a symbol of the shift away from the [[Ancien Régime]] to a more modern, democratic state.

===Violence against aristocracy and abolition of feudalism (15 July–August 1789)===
[[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]], a hero of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], on 15 July took command of the National Guard, and the king on 17 July accepted to wear the [[Flag of France#The Tricolore|two-colour cockade (blue and red)]], later adapted into the [[Flag of France#The Tricolore|tricolour cockade]], as the new symbol of revolutionary France.

Although peace was made, several nobles did not regard the new order as acceptable and emigrated in order to push the neighboring, aristocratic kingdoms to war against the new regime. The state was now struck for several weeks in July and August 1789 by violence against aristocracy, also called '[[Great Fear|the Great Fear]]'.

On 4 and 11 August 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolished privileges and feudalism]], sweeping away [[Serfdom|personal serfdom]],&lt;ref name="Bert Bakker 2008. pages 49"&gt;{{in lang|nl}} Niek Pas — ''De geschiedenis van Frankrijk in een notendop (The history of France in a nutshell)''.

The [[tithe]] was also abolished which had been the main source of income for many [[clergy]]men.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 3: The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (summer 1790–spring 1791)|pp=95–139}}

The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] was adopted by the National Assembly on 27 August 1789,{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013}} as a first step in their effort to write a constitution. Considered to be a precursor to modern international rights instruments and using the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] as a model, it defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of all of the estates as one. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights were deemed universal and valid in all times and places, pertaining to human nature itself. The Assembly also replaced France's historic provinces with eighty-three departments, uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in extent and population.

===Curtailment of Church powers (October 1789–December 1790)===
[[File:A Versailles, à Versailles 5 octobre 1789 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the [[Women's March on Versailles]], 5 October 1789]]

When a mob from Paris [[Women's March on Versailles|attacked the royal palace at Versailles in October 1789]] seeking redress for their severe poverty, the royal family was forced to move to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris.

Under the Ancien Régime, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] had been the largest landowner in the country. In November '89, the Assembly decided to nationalize and sell all church property,{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 3: The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (summer 1790–spring 1791)|pp=95–139}} thus in part addressing the financial crisis.

In July 1790, the Assembly adopted the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. This law reorganized the French [[Catholic Church]], arranged that henceforth the salaries of the priests would be paid by the state,{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 3: The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (summer 1790–spring 1791)|pp=95–139}} abolished the Church's authority to levy a tax on crops and again cancelled some privileges for the clergy. In October a group of 30 [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] wrote a declaration saying they could not accept the law, and this fueled civilian opposition against it. The Assembly then in late November 1790 decreed that all clergy should take an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. This stiffened the resistance, especially in the west of France including [[Normandy]], [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] and the [[Vendée]], where few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 3: The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (summer 1790–spring 1791)|pp=95–139}} Priests swearing the oath were designated 'constitutional', and those not taking the oath as 'non-juring' or '[[Refractory clergy|refractory]]' clergy.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 3: The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (summer 1790–spring 1791)|pp=55–87}}

===Making a constitutional monarchy (June–September 1791)===
In June 1791, the royal family secretly [[Flight to Varennes|fled Paris in disguise for Varennes]] near France's northeastern border in order to seek royalist support the king believed he could trust, but they were soon discovered en route. They were brought back to Paris, after which they were essentially kept under house arrest at the Tuileries.

In August 1791, Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] in the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] declared their intention to bring the French king in a position "to consolidate the basis of a monarchical government", and that they were preparing their own troops for action.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 4: The flight of the king and the decline of the French monarchy (summer 1791–summer 1792)|pp=141–186}} Instead of cowing the French, this infuriated them, and they militarised the borders.

With most of the Assembly still favoring a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise. Under the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 3 September 1791]], France would function as a [[Kingdom of France (1791–92)|constitutional monarchy]] with Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead. The King had to share power with the elected [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], although he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. He had perforce to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to [[de facto]] [[abdication]].

===War and internal uprisings (October 1791–August 1792)===
{{Further|10 August (French Revolution)}}
On 1 October 1791, the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] was formed, elected by those 4 million men — out of a population of 25 million — who paid a certain minimum amount of taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Jim Mitchell, ''The French legislative assembly of 1791'' (Brill, 1988). &lt;/ref&gt; A group of Assembly members who propagated war against [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was, after a remark by politician [[Maximilien Robespierre]], henceforth designated the '[[Girondins]]', although not all of them really came from the southern province of [[Gironde]]. A group around Robespierre — later called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s' — pleaded against war; this opposition between those groups would harden and become bitter in the next 1½ years.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 4: The flight of the king and the decline of the French monarchy (summer 1791–summer 1792)|pp=141–186}}

[[File:Siège des Tuileries, 1792, Musée de la Révolution française - Vizille.jpg|thumb|The storming of the [[Tuileries Palace]], 10 August 1792, ([[Musée de la Révolution française]])]]

In response to the threat of war of August 1791 from Austria and Prussia, leaders of the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] saw such a war as a means to strengthen support for their revolutionary government, and the French people as well as the Assembly thought that they would win a war against Austria and Prussia. On 20 April 1792, [[French Revolutionary Wars#1791–92|France declared war on Austria]].{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 4: The flight of the king and the decline of the French monarchy (summer 1791–summer 1792)|pp=141–186}}&lt;ref&gt;The present-day state of Austria did not exist as such, its territory was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] which also comprised the present-day states of [[Hungary]], [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648–1867)|Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia#Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1918)|Slovakia]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovenia#The Middle Ages to the early modern period|Slovenia]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]: that Habsburg Monarchy was usually called 'Austria'.&lt;/ref&gt; Late April 1792, France invaded and conquered the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (roughly present-day [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]).{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 4: The flight of the king and the decline of the French monarchy (summer 1791–summer 1792)|pp=141–186}}

Nevertheless, in the summer of 1792, all of Paris was against the king, and hoped that the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] would depose the king, but the Assembly hesitated. At dawn of 10 August 1792, a large, angry crowd of Parisians and soldiers from all over France [[10 August (French Revolution)|marched on the Tuileries Palace]] where the king resided. Around 8:00am the king decided to leave his palace and seek safety with his wife and children in the Assembly that was gathered in permanent session in [[Salle du Manège]] opposite to the Tuileries. After 11:00am, the Assembly 'temporarily relieved the king from his task'.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 5: The end of the monarchy and the September Murders (1792)|pp=187–221}} In reaction, on 19 August an army under Prussian general [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duke of Brunswick]] invaded France&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emersonkent.com/history/timelines/french_revolutionary_wars_timeline_1792.htm 'French Revolutionary Wars Timeline, 1792'].

===Bloodbath in Paris and the Republic established (September 1792)===
{{Further|National Convention}}
On 2, 3 and 4 September 1792, some three hundred volunteers and supporters of the revolution, infuriated by [[French Revolutionary Wars#1791–92|Verdun being captured by the Prussian enemy]], and rumours that the foreign enemy were conspiring with the incarcerated prisoners in Paris, raided the Parisian prisons. [[Jean-Paul Marat]] had called for preemptive action and between 1,200 and 1,400 prisoners were murdered within 20 hours ([[September Massacres]]), many of them [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nonjuring priests but also aristocrats, [[forger]]s and common criminals. In an open letter on 3 September the radical Marat incited the rest of France to follow the Parisian example. Danton and Robespierre kept a low profile in regard to the murder orgy.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 5: The end of the monarchy and the September Murders (1792)|pp=187–221}} The [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] and the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|city council of Paris (''la Commune'')]] seemed inapt and hardly motivated to call a halt to the unleashed bloodshed.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 5: The end of the monarchy and the September Murders (1792)|pp=187–221}}

On 20 September 1792, the French [[Battle of Valmy|won a battle against Prussian troops near Valmy]] and the new [[National Convention]] replaced the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]]. From the start the Convention suffered from the bitter division between a group around Robespierre, [[Georges Danton|Danton]] and Marat referred to as '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s' or 'left' and a group referred to as '[[Girondins]]' or 'right'. But the majority of the representatives, referred to as '[[The Plain|la Plaine]]', were member of neither of those two antagonistic groups and managed to preserve some speed in the convention's debates.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 5: The end of the monarchy and the September Murders (1792)|pp=187–221}}{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}} Right away on 21 September the Convention abolished the monarchy, making France the [[French First Republic]].{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 5: The end of the monarchy and the September Murders (1792)|pp=187–221}} A new [[French Republican Calendar]] was introduced to replace the Christian [[Gregorian calendar]], renaming the year 1792 as year 1 of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Bert Bakker 2008. pages 49" /&gt;

[[File:Execution of Louis XVI.jpg|thumb|The [[Execution of Louis XVI]] on 21 January 1793 in what is now the [[Place de la Concorde]], facing the empty pedestal where the statue of his grandfather, [[Louis XV]], had stood]]
With wars against Prussia and Austria having started earlier in 1792, in November France also declared war on the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}} Ex-king [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was [[Execution of Louis XVI|tried, convicted, and guillotined in January 1793]].{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=143–174}}

Introduction of a nationwide [[conscription]] for the army in February 1793 was the spark that in March made the [[Vendée]], already rebellious since 1790 because of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]],{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}} ignite into [[War in the Vendée|civil war against Paris]].{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}}{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=271–312}} Meanwhile, France in March also declared war on Spain.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}} That month, the Vendée rebels won some victories against Paris and the French army was [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|defeated in Belgium]] by Austria with the French general [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] defecting to the Austrians: the French Republic's survival was now in real danger.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}}

[[File:Fusillades de Nantes.jpg|thumb|Mass shootings at Nantes, [[War in the Vendée]], 1793]]
On 6 April 1793, to prevent the [[National Convention|Convention]] from losing itself in abstract debate and to streamline government decisions, the [[Committee of Public Safety|''Comité de salut public'' (Committee of Public Safety)]] was created of nine, later twelve members, as executive government which was accountable to the convention.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}} That month the '[[Girondins]]' group indicted [[Jean-Paul Marat]] before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] for 'attempting to destroy the sovereignty of the people' and 'preaching plunder and massacre', referring to his behaviour during the September 1792 Paris massacres.

===Showdown in the Convention (May–June 1793)===
{{See also|Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793}}
With rivalry, even enmity, in the [[National Convention]] and its predecessors between so-called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' and '[[Girondins]]' smouldering ever since late 1791, [[Jacques Hébert]], Convention member leaning to the 'Montagnards' group, on 24 May 1793 called on the ''[[sans-culottes]]''—the idealized simple, non-aristocratic, hard-working, upright, patriotic, republican, Paris labourers—to rise in revolt against the "henchmen of [[Louis XVI of France|Capet]] [= the killed ex-king] and [[Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] [= the defected general]". Hébert was arrested immediately by a Convention committee investigating Paris rebelliousness. While that committee consisted only of members from [[The Plain|la Plaine]] and the Girondins, the anger of the sans-culottes was directed towards the Girondins. 25 May, a delegation of [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|''la Commune'' (the Paris city council)]] protested against Hébert's arrest. The convention's President Isnard, a Girondin, answered them: "Members of ''la Commune'' (…) If by your incessant rebellions something befalls to the representatives of the nation, I declare, in the name of France, that Paris will be totally obliterated".{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}}

On 29 May 1793, in Lyon an uprising overthrew a group of Montagnards ruling the city; Marseille, Toulon and more cities saw similar events.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}}

On 2 June 1793, the convention's session in [[Tuileries Palace]]—since early May their venue—not for the first time degenerated into chaos and pandemonium. This time crowds of people including 80,000 armed soldiers swarmed in and around the palace. Incessant screaming from the public galleries, always in favour of the Montagnards, suggested that all of Paris was against the Girondins, which was not really the case. Petitions circulated, indicting and condemning 22 Girondins. Barère, member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], suggested: to end this division which is harming the Republic, the Girondin leaders should lay down their offices voluntarily. A decree was adopted that day by the convention, after much tumultuous debate, expelling 22 leading Girondins from the convention. Late that night, indeed dozens of Girondins had resigned and left the convention.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 6: The new French republic and its enemies (fall 1792–summer 1793)|pp=223–269}}

In the course of 1793, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the kings of [[History of Portugal (1777–1834)|Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand-Duke of Tuscany]] declared [[War of the First Coalition|war against France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Holland |first=Arthur William |title=The French Revolution |date=1910–1911 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1793, most French [[Departments of France|departments]] in one way or another opposed the central Paris government, and in many cases '[[Girondins]]', fled from Paris after 2 June, led those revolts.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} In Brittany's countryside, the people rejecting the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790 had taken to a guerrilla warfare known as ''[[Chouannerie]]''.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}} But generally, the French opposition against 'Paris' had now evolved into a plain struggle for power over the country{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} against the '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' around Robespierre and Marat now dominating Paris.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}}

In June–July 1793, Bordeaux, Marseilles, [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], [[Caen]] and the rest of [[Normandy]] gathered armies to march on Paris and against 'the revolution'.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=271–312}}{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}} In July, Lyon guillotined the deposed 'Montagnard' head of the city council.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}} Barère, member of [[Committee of Public Safety|the Committee of Public Safety]], on 1 August incited the convention to tougher measures against the [[War in the Vendée|Vendée, at war with Paris since March]]: "We'll have peace only when no Vendée remains… we'll have to exterminate that rebellious people".{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=271–312}} In August, [[National Convention|Convention]] troops besieged Lyon.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}}

17 October 1793, the 'blue' Republican army near [[Cholet]] defeated the 'white' [[War in the Vendée|Vendéan insubordinate army]] and all surviving Vendée residents, counting in tens of thousands, fled over the river Loire north into [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]].{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=271–312}} A Convention's [[Représentant en mission|representative on mission]] in [[Nantes]] commissioned in October to pacify the region did so by simply [[Drownings at Nantes|drowning prisoners in the river Loire]]: until February 1794 he drowned at least 4,000.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} By November 1793, the revolts in Normandy, Bordeaux and Lyon were overcome, in December also that in Toulon.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=175–203}} Two [[Représentant en mission|representatives on mission]] sent to punish Lyon between November 1793 and April 1794 executed 2,000 people by guillotine or firing-squad.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} The Vendéan army since October roaming through Brittany on 12 December 1793 again ran up against Republican troops and [[Battle of Le Mans (1793)|saw 10,000 of its rebels perish]], meaning the end of this once threatening army.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} Some historians claim that after that defeat Convention Republic armies in 1794 massacred 117,000 Vendéan civilians to obliterate the Vendéan people, but others contest that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tilly |first=Charles |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2h4nb1h9&amp;doc.view=content&amp;chunk.id=d0e1419&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;anchor.id=0&amp;brand=eschol |title=State and Counterrevolution in France |date=1990 |work=The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity |publisher=University of California Press |editor-last=Fehér |editor-first=Ferenc |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of 450,000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Linton |first=Marisa |title=The Terror in the French Revolution |publisher=Kingston University |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload,20545,en.pdf |url-status=dead |access-date=2 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117152123/http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload%2C20545%2Cen.pdf |archive-date=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hussenet |first=Jacques (dir.) |title="Détruisez la Vendée!"

===Death-sentencing politicians (February–July 1794)===
[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], 28 July 1794]]

[[Maximilien Robespierre]], since July 1793 member of the [[Committee of Public Safety|Committee of Public Prosperity]],{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 7: The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793)|pp=271–312}} on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified [[Jacques Hébert]] and his faction as "internal enemies" working toward the triumph of tyranny. After a dubious trial Hébert and some allies were guillotined in March.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} On 5 April, again at the instigation of Robespierre, [[Georges Danton|Danton]] and 13 associated politicians were executed. A week later again 19 politicians. This hushed the Convention deputies: if henceforth they disagreed with Robespierre they hardly dared to speak out.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} A [[Law of 22 Prairial|law enacted on 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial II)]] further streamlined criminal procedures: if the Revolutionary Tribunal saw sufficient proof of someone being an "enemy of the people" a counsel for defence would not be allowed. The frequency of [[guillotine]] executions in Paris now rose from on average three a day to an average of 29 a day.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}}

Meanwhile, [[French Revolutionary Wars#1794|France's external wars]] were going well, with [[Flanders Campaign#The French counter-offensive|victories over Austrian and British troops in May and June 1794]] opening up Belgium for French conquest.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} However, cooperation within the [[Committee of Public Safety]], since April 1793 the ''de facto'' executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at the [[Committee of Public Safety|Committee]] called him a dictator in his face — Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should have the courage to say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, which Robespierre refused to do.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}}

In the Convention session of 27 July 1794, Robespierre and his allies hardly managed to say a word as they were constantly interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Barère and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak. [[9 Thermidor (Fall of Robespierre)#Arrest of Robespierre and associates|A decree was adopted to arrest Robespierre]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and [[Georges Couthon|Couthon]]. 28 July, they and 19 others were beheaded. 29 July, again 70 Parisians were guillotined.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 8: The Reign of Terror (fall 1793–summer 1794)|p=271}} Subsequently, the [[Law of 22 Prairial|Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794)]] was repealed, and the '[[Girondins]]' expelled from the [[National Convention|Convention]] in June 1793, if not dead yet, were reinstated as Convention deputies.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}

===Disregarding the working classes (August 1794–October 1795)===
After July 1794, most civilians henceforth ignored the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar]] and returned to the traditional [[week|seven-day weeks]]. The government in a law of 21 February 1795 set steps of return to freedom of religion and reconciliation with the since 1790 [[Refractory clergy|refractory]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests, but any religious signs outside churches or private homes, such as crosses, clerical garb, bell ringing, remained prohibited. When the people's enthusiasm for attending church grew to unexpected levels the government backed out and in October 1795 again, like in 1790, required all priests to swear oaths on the Republic.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}

In the very cold winter of 1794–95, with [[French Revolutionary Wars#1795|the French army demanding]] more and more bread, same was getting scarce in Paris as was wood to keep houses warm, and in an echo of the [[Women's March on Versailles|October 1789 March on Versailles]], on 1 April 1795 (12 [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal III]]) a mostly female crowd marched on the [[National Convention|Convention]] calling for bread. But no Convention member sympathized, they just told the women to return home. Again in May a crowd of 20,000 men and 40,000 women invaded the convention and even killed a deputy in the halls, but again they failed to make the Convention take notice of the needs of the lower classes. Instead, the Convention banned women from all political assemblies, and deputies who had solidarized with this insurrection were sentenced to death: such allegiance between parliament and street fighting was no longer tolerated.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}

Late 1794, France conquered present-day [[Belgium]].{{Sfnp|Doyle|1989|pp=206–207}} In January 1795 they subdued the [[Dutch Republic]] with full consent and cooperation of the influential Dutch [[Patriottentijd|''patriottenbeweging'' ('patriots' movement')]], resulting in the [[Batavian Republic]], a satellite and puppet state of France.{{Sfnp|Schama|1977|pp=178–192 &lt;!--Simon Schama--&gt;}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2021}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Geschiedenis van de Nederlanden [History of the Low Countries] |date=2003 |isbn=978-1-84545-272-8 |editor-last=Blom |editor-first=J.C.H. |edition=3rd |pages=227–228 |editor-last2=Lamberts |editor-first2=E. |orig-date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1795, France concluded [[Peace of Basel|a peace agreement]] with [[Prussia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Engels |first=Ernst August Richard |title=Friedrich Nicolais "Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek" und der Friede von Basel 1795 |date=1936 |publisher=Buchdruckerei R.

===Fighting Catholicism and royalism (October 1795–November 1799)===
In October 1795, the Republic was reorganised, replacing the one-chamber parliament (the [[National Convention]]) by a bi-cameral system: the first chamber called the '[[Council of Five Hundred|Council of 500]]' initiating the laws, the second the '[[Council of Ancients|Council of Elders]]' reviewing and approving or not the passed laws. Each year, one-third of the chambers was to be renewed. The executive power lay with five [[French Directory|director]]s — hence the name '[[French Directory|Directory]]' for this form of government — with a five-year mandate, each year one of them being replaced.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}
&lt;br/&gt;The early directors did not much understand the nation they were governing; they especially had an innate inability to see [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] as anything else than counter-revolutionary and royalist. Local administrators had a better sense of people's priorities, and one of them wrote to the minister of the interior: "Give back the crosses, the church bells, the Sundays, and everyone will cry: ''{{'}}vive la République!{{'}}''"{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}

French armies in 1796 [[War of the First Coalition#1796|advanced into Germany, Austria and Italy]]. In 1797, [[War of the First Coalition#1797|France conquered Rhineland, Belgium and much of Italy, and unsuccessfully attacked Wales]].

Parliamentary elections in the spring of 1797 resulted in considerable gains for the royalists. This frightened the republican directors and they staged a [[coup d'état]] on 4 September 1797 ([[Coup of 18 Fructidor|Coup of 18 Fructidor V]]) to remove two supposedly pro-royalist directors and some prominent royalists from both Councils.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}
The new, 'corrected' government, still strongly convinced that Catholicism and royalism were equally dangerous to the Republic, started a fresh campaign to promote the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar]] officially introduced in 1792, with its ten-day week, and tried to hallow the tenth day, [[French Republican Calendar#Ten days of the week|''décadi'']], as substitute for the [[Lord's Day|Christian Sunday]]. Not only citizens opposed and even mocked such decrees, also local government officials refused to enforce such laws.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}

France was [[French Revolutionary Wars|still waging wars]], in [[French Revolutionary Wars#1798|1798 in Egypt, Switzerland, Rome, Ireland, Belgium and against the U.S.A.]], in [[French Revolutionary Wars#1799|1799 in Baden-Württemberg]]. In 1799, when the French armies abroad [[French Revolutionary Wars#1799|experienced some setbacks]], the newly chosen director [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Sieyes]] considered a new overhaul necessary for the [[French Directory|Directory's form of government]] because in his opinion it needed a stronger executive. Together with successful general [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] who had just returned to France, Sieyes began preparing another [[coup d'état]], which [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|took place on 9–10 November 1799 (18–19 Brumaire VIII)]], replacing the five directors now with three "[[French Consulate|consuls]]": Napoleon, Sieyes, and Roger Ducos.{{Sfnp|Shusterman|2013|loc=Chapter 9: After the Terror (fall 1794–1799)|pp=235–254}}

==Napoleonic France (1799–1815)==
{{See also|Napoleonic wars}}
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on His Imperial Throne]]'', by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] ]]
During the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792–97), the [[French Directory|Directoire]] had replaced the National Convention. Five directors then ruled France. As Great Britain was still at war with France, a plan was made to [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|take Egypt]] from the Ottoman Empire, a British ally. This was [[Napoleon]]'s idea and the Directoire agreed to the plan in order to send the popular general away from the mainland. Napoleon defeated the Ottoman forces during the [[Battle of the Pyramids]] (21 July 1798) and sent hundreds of scientists and linguists out to thoroughly explore modern and ancient Egypt. Only a few weeks later the British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Horatio Nelson]] unexpectedly destroyed the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] (1–3 August 1798). Napoleon planned to move into Syria but was defeated at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]] and he returned to France without his army, which surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Strathern |first=Paul |title=Napoleon in Egypt |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directoire was threatened by the [[War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition]] (1798–1802). Royalists and their allies still dreamed of restoring the monarchy to power, while the Prussian and Austrian crowns did not accept their territorial losses during the previous war. In 1799 the Russian army expelled the French from Italy in battles such as [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Cassano]], while the Austrian army defeated the French in Switzerland at [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]] and [[First Battle of Zürich|Zurich]]. Napoleon then seized power through a coup and established the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] in 1799. The Austrian army was defeated at the [[Battle of Marengo (1800)]] and again at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden (1800)]].{{Sfnp|Nafziger|2002}}

While at sea [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|the French]] had some success at Boulogne but Nelson's Royal Navy destroyed an anchored Danish and Norwegian fleet at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)]] because the Scandinavian kingdoms were against the British blockade of France. The Second Coalition was beaten and peace was settled in two distinct treaties: the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] and the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. A brief interlude of peace ensued in 1802–3, during which Napoleon [[Louisiana Purchase|sold French Louisiana]] to the United States because it was indefensible.{{Sfnp|Nafziger|2002}}

In 1801 Napoleon concluded a "Concordat" with Pope Pius VII that opened peaceful relations between church and state in France. The policies of the Revolution were reversed, except the Church did not get its lands back. Bishops and clergy were to receive state salaries, and the government would pay for the building and maintenance of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aston |first=Nigel |title=Religion and revolution in France, 1780–1804 |date=2000 |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon reorganized higher learning by dividing the ''Institut National'' into four (later five) academies.

[[File:La bataille d'Austerlitz. 2 decembre 1805 (François Gérard).jpg|thumb|alt=Napoléon at the Battle of Austerlitz, by François Gérard|Napoléon at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], by [[François Gérard]]]]
In 1804 Napoleon was titled Emperor by the senate, thus founding the [[First French Empire]]. Napoleon's rule was constitutional, and although autocratic, it was much more advanced than traditional European monarchies of the time. The proclamation of the French Empire was met by the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]]. The French army was renamed ''[[La Grande Armée]]'' in 1805 and Napoleon used propaganda and nationalism to control the French population. The French army achieved a resounding victory at [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]] (16–19 October 1805), where an entire Austrian army was captured.&lt;ref name="Robert P. Goetz 2005"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goetz |first=Robert P. |title=1805: Austerlitz: Napoleon and the Destruction of the Third Coalition |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] (21 October 1805) and all plans to invade Britain were then made impossible. Despite this naval defeat, it was on the ground that this war would be won; Napoleon inflicted on the Austrian and Russian Empires one of their greatest defeats at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (also known as the "Battle of the Three Emperors" on 2 December 1805), destroying the Third Coalition. Peace was settled in the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]; the Austrian Empire lost the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] was created by Napoleon over former Austrian territories.&lt;ref name="Robert P. Goetz 2005" /&gt;

===Coalitions formed against Napoleon===
Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]]. Although the Coalition was joined by other allies, the French Empire was also not alone since it now had a complex network of allies and subject states. The largely outnumbered French army crushed the Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806; Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the [[Battle of Friedland]] (14 June 1807). Peace was dictated in the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], in which Russia had to join the [[Continental System]], and Prussia handed half of its territories to France. The [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was formed over these territorial losses, and Polish troops entered the Grande Armée in significant numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kagan |first=Frederick |title=The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801–1805 |date=2007 |isbn=9780306816451 |page=141ff |author-link=Frederick Kagan |orig-date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ruin the British economy, Napoleon set up the [[Continental System]] in 1807, and tried to prevent merchants across Europe from trading with British. The large amount of smuggling frustrated Napoleon, and did more harm to his economy than to his enemies.{{Sfnp|Lefebvre|1969|pp=1–32, 205–262}}

[[File:Napoleoniceurope.png|thumb|The height of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]]]]
Freed from his obligation in the east, Napoleon then went back to the west, as the French Empire was still at war with Britain. Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)]], a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, was made King of Spain after [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] abdicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Glover |first=Michael |title=Legacy of glory: the Bonaparte kingdom of Spain, 1808–1813 |date=1971 |isbn=9780684125589 |author-link=Michael Glover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese fought the French using [[guerilla tactics]], defeating the French forces at the [[Battle of Bailén]] (June and July 1808). Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the [[Convention of Sintra]] following the Allied victory at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]] (21 August 1808). France only controlled [[Catalonia]] and [[Navarre]] and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Tranié |first1=J. |title=Napoleon's War in Spain: The French Peninsular Campaigns, 1807–1814 |last2=Carmigniani |first2=Juan Carlos |last3=Lachouque |first3=Henry |last4=de Beaufort |first4=Louis |date=1994 |isbn=9780853685067 |author-link4=Louis de Beaufort |orig-date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as "an avalanche of fire and steel." However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], yet was beaten at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]] while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at [[Battle of Raszyn (1809)|Raszyn]] (April 1809). Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn|peace treaty]] in October 1809 stripped Austria of a large amount of territories, reducing it even more.

[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|Napoleon Bonaparte retreating from Moscow, by [[Adolf Northern]] ]]
In 1812 war broke out with Russia, engaging Napoleon in the disastrous [[French invasion of Russia (1812)]]. Napoleon assembled the largest army Europe had ever seen, including troops from all subject states, to invade Russia, which had just left the continental system and was gathering an army on the Polish frontier. Following an exhausting march and the bloody but inconclusive [[Battle of Borodino]], near Moscow, the Grande Armée entered and captured Moscow, only to find it burning as part of the Russian [[scorched earth]] tactics. Although there still were battles, the Napoleonic army left Russia in late 1812 annihilated, most of all by the Russian winter, exhaustion, and scorched earth warfare. On the Spanish front the French troops were defeated at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]] (June 1813) and then at the [[Battle of the Pyrenees]] (July–August 1813). Since the Spanish guerrillas seemed to be uncontrollable, the French troops eventually evacuated Spain.{{Sfnp|Lefebvre|1969|pp=309–352}}

Since France had been defeated on these two fronts, states that had been conquered and controlled by Napoleon saw a good opportunity to strike back. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] was formed under British leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Muir |first=Rory |title=Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807–1815 |date=1996 |isbn=9780300197570}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was largely defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] outside Leipzig in October 1813, his forces heavily outnumbered by the Allied coalition armies and was overwhelmed by much larger armies during the [[Six Days Campaign]] (February 1814), although, the Six Days Campaign is often considered a tactical masterpiece because the allies suffered much higher casualties. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, and was exiled to [[Elba]].{{Sfnp|Roberts|2014|pp=662–712}}

The [[Conservative Order|conservative]] [[Congress of Vienna]] reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon suddenly returned, seized control of France, raised an army, and marched on his enemies in the [[Hundred Days]]. It ended with his final defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, and his exile to St. Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic Ocean.{{Sfnp|Lefebvre|1969|pp=353–372}}

The monarchy was subsequently restored and [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], Younger brother of Louis XVI became king, and the exiles returned. However many of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic reforms were kept in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stewart |first=John Hall |title=The restoration era in France, 1814–1830 |date=1968 |isbn=9780844630137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoleon's impact on France===
Napoleon centralized power in Paris, with all the provinces governed by all-powerful prefects whom he selected. They were more powerful than royal intendants of the ancien régime and had a long-term impact in unifying the nation, minimizing regional differences, and shifting all decisions to Paris.{{Sfnp|Goubert|1988|loc=Chapter 14}}

Religion had been a major issue during the Revolution, and Napoleon resolved most of the outstanding problems. Thereby he moved the clergy and large numbers of devout Catholics from hostility to the government to support for him. The Catholic system was reestablished by the [[Concordat of 1801]] (signed with Pope [[Pius VII]]), so that church life returned to normal; the church lands were not restored, but the Jesuits were allowed back in and the bitter fights between the government and Church ended. Protestant, Jews and atheists were tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sutherland |first=D. M. G. |title=The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order |date=2003 |isbn=9780631233626 |pages=329–333 |orig-date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French taxation system had collapsed in the 1780s. In the 1790s the government seized and sold church lands and lands of exiles aristocrats. Napoleon instituted a modern, efficient tax system that guaranteed a steady flow of revenues and made long-term financing possible.{{Sfnp|Lefebvre|1969|pp=171–179}}

Napoleon kept the system of conscription that had been created in the 1790s, so that every young man served in the army, which could be rapidly expanded even as it was based on a core of careerists and talented officers. Before the Revolution the aristocracy formed the officer corps. Now promotion was by merit and achievement—every private carried a marshal's baton, it was said.{{Sfnp|Sutherland|2003|pp=336–372}}

The modern era of French education began in the 1790s. The Revolution in the 1790s abolished the traditional universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Barnard |first=Howard Clive |title=Education and the French Revolution |date=1969 |isbn=9780521072564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sought to replace them with new institutions, the [[École Polytechnique]], focused on technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bradley |first=Margaret |date=1976 |title=Scientific Education for a New Society The Ecole&lt;!--[sic; no accent]--&gt; Polytechnique 1795–1830 |journal=[[History of Education: Journal of the History of Education Society|History of Education]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=11–24 |doi=10.1080/0046760760050103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elementary schools received little attention.

====Napoleonic Code====
Of permanent importance was the [[Napoleonic Code]] created by eminent jurists under Napoleon's supervision. Praised for its Gallic clarity, it spread rapidly throughout Europe and the world in general, and marked the end of feudalism and the liberation of serfs where it took effect.{{Sfnp|Grab|2003}} The Code recognized the principles of civil liberty, equality before the law, and the secular character of the state. It discarded the old right of primogeniture (where only the eldest son inherited) and required that inheritances be divided equally among all the children. The court system was standardized; all judges were appointed by the national government in Paris.{{Sfnp|Goubert|1988|loc=Chapter 14}}

==Long 19th century, 1815–1914==
{{Main|France in the long nineteenth century|History of French foreign relations}}
The century after the fall of Napoleon I was politically unstable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every head of state from 1814 to 1873 spent part of his life in exile. Every regime was the target of assassination attempts of a frequency that put Spanish and Russian politics in the shade. Even in peaceful times governments changed every few months. In less peaceful times, political deaths, imprisonments and deportations are literally incalculable.{{Sfnp|Tombs|2014|p=15}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

France was no longer the dominant power it had been before 1814, but it played a major role in European economics, culture, diplomacy and military affairs. The Bourbons were restored, but left a weak record and one branch was overthrown in 1830 and the other branch in 1848 as Napoleon's nephew was elected president. He made himself emperor as [[Napoleon III]], but was overthrown when he was defeated and captured by Prussians in an 1870 war that humiliated France and made the new nation of Germany dominant in the continent. The Third Republic was established, but the possibility of a return to monarchy remained into the 1880s. The French built up an empire, especially in Africa and Indochina. The economy was strong, with a good railway system. The arrival of the [[Rothschild banking family of France]] in 1812 guaranteed the role of Paris alongside London as a major center of international finance.

===Permanent changes in French society===
The French Revolution and Napoleonic eras brought a series of major changes to France which the Bourbon restoration did not reverse. First of all, France became highly centralized, with all decisions made in Paris. The political geography was completely reorganized and made uniform. France was divided into 80+ departments, which have endured into the 21st century. Each department had the identical administrative structure, and was tightly controlled by a prefect appointed by Paris. The complex multiple overlapping legal jurisdictions of the old regime had all been abolished, and there was now one standardized legal code, administered by judges appointed by Paris, and supported by police under national control. Education was centralized, with the Grand Master of the University of France controlling every element of the entire educational system from Paris. Newly technical universities were opened in Paris which to this day have a critical role in training the elite.

Conservatism was bitterly split into the old aristocracy that returned, and the new elites that arose after 1796. The old aristocracy was eager to regain its land but felt no loyalty to the new regime. The new elite — the "noblesse d'empire" — ridiculed the other group as an outdated remnant of a discredited regime that had led the nation to disaster. Both groups shared a fear of social disorder, but the level of distrust as well as the cultural differences were too great and the monarchy too inconsistent in its policies for political cooperation to be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Gordon K. |date=1994 |title=Old Nobles and Noblesse d'Empire, 1814–1830: In Search of a Conservative Interest in Post-Revolutionary France |journal=[[French History (journal)|French History]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=149–166 |doi=10.1093/fh/8.2.149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old aristocracy had returned, and recovered much of the land they owned directly. However they completely lost all their old seigneurial rights to the rest of the farmland, and the peasants no longer were under their control. The old aristocracy had dallied with the ideas of the Enlightenment and rationalism. Now the aristocracy was much more conservative, and much more supportive of the Catholic Church. For the best jobs meritocracy was the new policy, and aristocrats had to compete directly with the growing business and professional class. Anti-clerical sentiment became much stronger than ever before, but was now based in certain elements of the middle class and indeed the peasantry as well.

In France, as in most of Europe, the sum total of wealth was concentrated. The richest 10 percent of families owned between 80 and 90 percent of the wealth from 1810 to 1914. Their share then fell to about 60 percent, where it remained into the 21st century. The share of the top one percent of the population grew from 45 percent in 1810 to 60 percent in 1914, then fell steadily to 20 percent in 1970 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Piketty |first=Thomas |title=[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]] |date=2014 |pages=339–345 |author-link=Thomas Piketty}} For much more detailed coverage, see {{Cite book |author-link=Thomas Piketty |first=Thomas |last=Piketty |title=Top Incomes in France in the Twentieth Century: Inequality and Redistribution, 1901–1998 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "200 families" controlled much of the nation's wealth after 1815. The "200" is based on the policy that of the 40,000 shareholders of the [[Bank of France]], only 200 were allowed to attend the annual meeting and they cast all the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zeldin |first=Theodore |title=France 1848–1945 |date=1973 |volume=1: Ambition, Love, and Politics |pages=53–62 |author-link=Theodore Zeldin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a nation of 27 million people, only 80,000 to 90,000 were allowed to vote in 1820, and the richest one-fourth of them had two votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Spitzer |first=Alan B. |date=1983 |title=Restoration Political Theory and the Debate over the Law of the Double Vote |journal=[[Journal of Modern History]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=54–70 |doi=10.1086/242418 |jstor=1878978 |s2cid=153488328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great masses of the French people were peasants in the countryside, or impoverished workers in the cities. They gained new rights, and a new sense of possibilities. Although relieved of many of the old burdens, controls, and taxes, the peasantry was still highly traditional in its social and economic behavior. Many eagerly took on mortgages to buy as much land as possible for their children, so debt was an important factor in their calculations. The working class in the cities was a small element, and had been freed of many restrictions imposed by medieval guilds. However France was very slow to industrialize (in the sense of large factories using modern machinery), and much of the work remained drudgery without machinery or technology to help. This provided a good basis for small-scale expensive luxury crafts that attracted an international upscale market. France was still localized, especially in terms of language, but now there was an emerging French nationalism that showed its national pride in the Army, and foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolf |first=John B. |title=France: 1814–1919: The Rise of a Liberal Democratic Society |date=1962 |edition=2nd |pages=4–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McPhee |first=Peter |title=A social history of France 1780–1880 |date=1992 |pages=93–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in France# History}}
The Catholic Church lost all its lands and buildings during the Revolution, and these were sold off or came under the control of local governments. The bishop still ruled his diocese (which was aligned with the new department boundaries), but could only communicate with the pope through the government in Paris. Bishops, priests, nuns and other religious people were paid salaries by the state. All the old religious rites and ceremonies were retained, and the government maintained the religious buildings. The Church was allowed to operate its own seminaries and to some extent local schools as well, although this became a central political issue into the 20th century. Bishops were much less powerful than before, and had no political voice. However, the Catholic Church reinvented itself and put a new emphasis on personal religiosity that gave it a hold on the psychology of the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=McMillan |first=James |year=2014 |title=Catholic Christianity in France from the Restoration to the separation of church and state, 1815–1905 |volume=8 |pages=217–232 |work=The Cambridge history of Christianity |editor-last=Gilley |editor-first=Sheridan |editor2-first=Brian |editor2-last=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France remained basically Catholic. The 1872 census counted 36 million people, of whom 35.4 million were listed as Catholics, 600,000 as Protestants, 50,000 as Jews and 80,000 as freethinkers. The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church, and Napoleon's concordat of 1801 restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in 1814 brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church, seeing it as a bastion of conservatism and monarchism. However the monasteries with their vast land holdings and political power were gone; much of the land had been sold to urban entrepreneurs who lacked historic connections to the land and the peasants.{{Sfnp|Gildea|2008|p=120}}

Few new priests were trained in the 1790–1814 period, and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790 to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly. Entire regions, especially around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand, some traditional regions held fast to the faith, led by local nobles and historic families.{{Sfnp|Gildea|2008|p=120}}

The comeback was very slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and a new emphasis on liturgy and devotions to the Virgin Mary, plus support from Napoleon III, there was a comeback. In 1870 there were 56,500 priests, representing a much younger and more dynamic force in the villages and towns, with a thick network of schools, charities and lay organizations.{{Sfnp|Price|1987|loc=Ch. 7}} Conservative Catholics held control of the national government, 1820–30, but most often played secondary political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans, liberals, socialists and seculars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Latourette |first=Kenneth Scott |title=Christianity in a Revolutionary Age |date=1958 |volume=I: The 19th Century in Europe; Background and the Roman Catholic Phase |pages=400–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zeldin |first=Theodore |title=France 1848–1945 |date=1977 |volume=2 |pages=983–1040 |author-link=Theodore Zeldin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
{{Further|Economic history of France}}
French economic history since its late-18th century Revolution was tied to three major events and trends: the Napoleonic Era, the competition with Britain and its other neighbors in regards to 'industrialization', and the 'total wars' of the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Quantitative analysis of output data shows the French per capita growth rates were slightly smaller than Britain. However the British population tripled in size, while France grew by only third—so the overall British economy grew much faster. The ups and downs of French per capita economic growth in 1815–1913:
* 1815–1840: irregular, but sometimes fast growth
* 1840–1860: fast growth
* 1860–1882: slowing down
* 1882–1896: stagnation
* 1896–1913: fast growth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Crouzet |first=François |date=1974 |title=French Economic Growth in the 19th century reconsidered |journal=[[History: The Journal of the Historical Association|History]] |volume=59 |issue=196 |pages=167–179 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02212.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1870–1913 era, the growth rates for 12 similar advanced countries — 10 in Europe plus the United States and Canada — show that in terms of per capita growth, France was about average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maddison |first=Angus |title=Economic Growth in the West |date=1964 |isbn=9780527028268 |pages=28, 30, 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; However its population growth was very slow, so as far as the growth rate in total size of the economy France was in next to the last place, just ahead of Italy. The 12 countries averaged 2.7% per year in total output, but France only averaged 1.6%.{{Sfnp|Crouzet|1974|p=169}}
{{Blockquote|[The] average size of industrial undertakings was smaller in France than in other advanced countries; that machinery was generally less up to date, productivity lower, costs higher. The domestic system and handicraft production long persisted, while big modern factories were for long exceptional. Large lumps of the Ancien Régime economy survived….On the whole, the qualitative lag between the British and French economy…persisted during the whole period under consideration, and later on a similar lag developed between France and some other countries—Belgium, Germany, the United States. France did not succeed in catching up with Britain, but was overtaken by several of her rivals.{{Sfnp|Crouzet|1974|p=172}}}}

===Bourbon restoration: (1814–1830)===
{{main|Bourbon Restoration in France}}
[[File:Réception de Louis XVIII à l'Hôtel de Ville, 29 août 1814.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XVIII]] makes a return at the [[Hôtel de Ville de Paris]] on 29 August 1814.]]

This period of time is called the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration]] and was marked by conflicts between reactionary [[Ultra-royalists]], who wanted to restore the pre-1789 system of absolute monarchy, and liberals, who wanted to strengthen constitutional monarchy. [[Louis XVIII]] was the younger brother of [[Louis XVI]], and reigned from 1814 to 1824. On becoming king, Louis issued a constitution known as the Charter which preserved many of the liberties won during the French Revolution and provided for a parliament composed of an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Peers that was nominated by the king.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=293}}

====Evaluation====
After two decades of war and revolution, the restoration brought peace and quiet, and general prosperity. "Frenchmen were, on the whole, well governed, prosperous, contented during the 15-year period; one historian even describes the restoration era as 'one of the happiest periods in [France's] history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wright |first=Gordon |title=France in Modern Times: From the Enlightenment to the Present |date=1995 |isbn=9780393967050 |orig-date=1960 |edition=5th |page=105 |author-link=Gordon Wright (historian)}}, quoting [[Bertier de Sauvigny]].&lt;/ref&gt;

France had recovered from the strain and disorganization, the wars, the killings, and the horrors of two decades of disruption. It was at peace throughout the period. It paid a large war indemnity to the winners, but managed to finance that without distress; the occupation soldiers left peacefully. Population increased by 3 million, and prosperity was strong from 1815 to 1825, with the depression of 1825 caused by bad harvests. The national credit was strong, there was significant increase in public wealth, and the national budget showed a surplus every year. In the private sector, banking grew dramatically, making Paris a world center for finance, along with London. The Rothschild family was world-famous, with the French branch led by [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792–1868). The communication system was improved, as roads were upgraded, canals were lengthened, and steamboat traffic became common. Industrialization was delayed in comparison to Britain and Belgium. The railway system had yet to make an appearance. Industry was heavily protected with tariffs, so there was little demand for entrepreneurship or innovation.{{Sfnp|Bury|1949|pp=41–42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clapham |first=J.

Culture flourished with the new romantic impulses. Oratory was highly regarded, and debates were very high standard. Châteaubriand and [[Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]] (1766–1817) enjoyed Europe-wide reputations for their innovations in romantic literature. She made important contributions to political sociology, and the sociology of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=de Staël |first1=Germaine |title=Politics, Literature, and National Character |last2=Berger |first2=Monroe |date=2000 |isbn=9781412831482 |author-link=Germaine de Staël}}&lt;/ref&gt; History flourished; [[François Guizot]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and Madame de Staël drew lessons from the past to guide the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Lucian |date=2017 |title=Accounts of early Christian history in the thought of François Guizot, Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël 1800–c. 1833 |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/260451 |journal=History of European Ideas |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=628–648 |doi=10.1080/01916599.2016.1223735 |s2cid=219568410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[Eugène Delacroix]] set the standards for romantic art.

Major new institutions gave France world leadership in numerous advanced fields, as typified by the [[École Nationale des Chartes]] (1821) for historiography, the [[École Centrale Paris|École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures]] in 1829 for innovative engineering; and the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] for the fine arts, reestablished in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do9o-jIrzXgC&amp;pg=PA133 |title=The State Nobility: Elite Schools in the Field of Power |date=1998 |isbn=9780804733465 |pages=133–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the Bourbon government's handling of foreign affairs was successful. France kept a low profile, and Europe forgot of its animosities. Louis and Charles had little interest in foreign affairs, so France played only minor roles. Its army helped restore the Spanish monarch in 1823. It helped the other powers deal with Greece and Turkey. [[Charles X of France|King Charles X]], an ultra reactionary, mistakenly thought that foreign glory would cover domestic frustration, so he made an all-out effort to conquer Algiers in 1830. He sent a massive force of 38,000 soldiers and 4500 horses carried by 103 warships and 469 merchant ships. The expedition was a dramatic military success in only three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Falls |first=Nigel |date=2005 |title=The Conquest of Algiers |journal=[[History Today]] |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion paid for itself with 48 million francs from the captured treasury. The episode launched the second French colonial empire, but it did not provide desperately needed political support for the King at home. Charles X repeatedly exacerbated internal tensions, and tried to neutralize his enemies with repressive measures. He depended too heavily upon his inept chief minister [[Jules, prince de Polignac|Polignac]]. Repression failed and a quick sudden revolution forced Charles into exile for the third time.{{Sfnp|Bury|1949|pp=43–44}}

===July Monarchy (1830–1848)===
[[File:Prise de l'Hôtel de ville - le Pont d'Arcole.JPG|thumb|The taking of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] — the seat of Paris's government — during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830]]

Protest against the absolute monarchy was in the air. The elections of deputies to 16 May 1830 had gone very badly for King Charles X.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=287}} In response, he tried repression but that only aggravated the crisis as suppressed deputies, gagged journalists, students from the University and many working men of Paris poured into the streets and erected barricades during the "three glorious days" (French ''Les Trois Glorieuses'') of 26–29 July 1830. Charles X was deposed and replaced by [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]] in the [[July Revolution]]. It is traditionally regarded as a rising of the bourgeoisie against the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons. Participants in the July Revolution included Marie Joseph Paul Ives Roch [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette]]. Working behind the scenes on behalf of the bourgeois propertied interests was [[Louis Adolphe Thiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rule |first1=James |last2=Tilly |first2=Charles |date=1972 |title=1830 and the Unnatural History of Revolution1 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50849/68.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=49–76 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1972.tb00004.x |hdl=2027.42/50849|hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis-Philippe's "[[July Monarchy]]" (1830–1848) was dominated by the ''haute bourgeoisie'' (high bourgeoisie) of bankers, financiers, industrialists and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Beik, ''Louis Philippe and the July Monarchy'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of the July Monarchy, [[Romanticism|the Romantic Era]] was starting to bloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The French Romantics |date=1984 |isbn=9780521259712 |editor-last=Charlton |editor-first=Donald G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driven by the Romantic Era, an atmosphere of protest and revolt was all around in France. On 22 November 1831 in Lyon (the second largest city in France) the silk workers revolted and took over the town hall in protest of recent salary reductions and working conditions. This was one of the first instances of a workers revolt in the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McDougall |first=Mary Lynn |date=1978 |title=Consciousness and Community: The Workers of Lyon, 1830–1850 |journal=[[Journal of Social History]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=129–145 |doi=10.1353/jsh/12.1.129 |jstor=3787460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the constant threats to the throne, the July Monarchy began to rule with a stronger and stronger hand. Soon political meetings were outlawed. However, "banquets" were still legal and all through 1847, there was a nationwide campaign of republican banquets demanding more democracy. The climaxing banquet was scheduled for 22 February 1848 in Paris but the government banned it. In response citizens of all classes poured out onto the streets of Paris in a revolt against the July Monarchy. Demands were made for abdication of "Citizen King" Louis-Philippe and for establishment of a representative democracy in France.{{Sfnp|Agulhon|1983|pp=23–40}} The king abdicated, and the [[French Second Republic]] was proclaimed. [[Alphonse Marie Louis de Lamartine]], who had been a leader of the moderate republicans in France during the 1840s, became the Minister of Foreign Affairs and in effect the premier in the new Provisional government. In reality Lamartine was the virtual head of government in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Latimer |first=Elizabeth Wormeley |title=France in the Nineteenth Century, 1830–1890 |date=1892 |publisher=A.

===Second Republic (1848–1852)===
{{See also|French Revolution of 1848|June Days Uprising}}
[[File:Alexandre Cabanel 002.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon III]], Emperor of the French. His very widespread popularity came from being the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte.]]
Frustration among the laboring classes arose when the Constituent Assembly did not address the concerns of the workers. Strikes and worker demonstrations became more common as the workers gave vent to these frustrations. These demonstrations reached a climax when on 15 May 1848, workers from the secret societies broke out in armed uprising against the anti-labor and anti-democratic policies being pursued by the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Government. Fearful of a total breakdown of law and order, the Provisional Government invited General [[Louis Eugene Cavaignac]] back from Algeria, in June 1848, to put down the [[June Days Uprising|workers' armed revolt]]. From June 1848 until December 1848 General Cavaignac became head of the executive of the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fortescue |first=William |title=France and 1848: the end of monarchy |date=2005 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 1848, [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]] was elected president by a landslide. His support came from a wide section of the French public. Various classes of French society voted for Louis Napoleon for very different and often contradictory reasons.{{Sfnp|Fortescue|2005|p=135}} Louis Napoleon himself encouraged this contradiction by "being all things to all people." One of his major promises to the peasantry and other groups was that there would be no new taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Corley |first=T. A. B. |title=Democratic Despot: A Life of Napoleon III |date=1961 |pages=74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] was heavily composed of royalist sympathizers of both the Legitimist (Bourbon) wing and the Orleanist (Citizen King Louis Philippe) wing. Because of the ambiguity surrounding Louis Napoleon's political positions, his agenda as president was very much in doubt. For prime minister, he selected [[Odilon Barrot]], an unobjectionable middle-road parliamentarian who had led the "loyal opposition" under Louis Philippe. Other appointees represented various royalist factions.{{Sfnp|Corley|1961|pp=74–77}}

The [[Pope]] had been forced out of Rome as part of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], and Louis Napoleon sent a 14,000-man expeditionary force of troops to the Papal State under General [[Charles Oudinot|Nicolas Charles Victor Oudinot]] to restore him. In late April 1849, it was defeated and pushed back from Rome by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s volunteer corps, but then it recovered and recaptured Rome.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=305}}

In June 1849, demonstrations against the government broke out and were suppressed. The leaders, including prominent politicians, were arrested. The government banned several democratic and socialist newspapers in France; the editors were arrested. [[Karl Marx]] was at risk, so in August he moved to London.{{Sfnp|Agulhon|1983|pp=78–80}}

The government sought ways to balance its budget and reduce its debts. Toward this end, [[Hippolyte Passy]] was appointed Finance Minister. When the Legislative Assembly met at the beginning of October 1849, Passy proposed an income tax to help balance the finances of France. The bourgeoisie, who would pay most of the tax, protested. The furor over the income tax caused the resignation of Barrot as prime minister, but a new wine tax also caused protests.{{Sfnp|Agulhon|1983|pp=117–138}}

The 1850 elections resulted in a conservative body. It passed the [[Falloux Laws]], putting education into the hands of the Catholic clergy. It opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the [[Jules Ferry laws]] reversed course in 1879. The Falloux Laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula were similar in Catholic and state schools. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harrigan |first=Patrick J. |date=April 2001 |title=Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment |journal=[[Canadian Journal of History]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=51–83 |doi=10.3138/cjh.36.1.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a new electoral law was passed that respected the principle of universal (male) suffrage, the stricter residential requirement of the new law actually had the effect of disenfranchising 3,000,000 of 10,000,000 voters.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|pp=305–306}}

===Second Empire, 1852–1870===
The president rejected the constitution and made himself emperor as Napoleon III. He is known for working to modernize the French economy, [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|the rebuilding of Paris]], expanding the overseas empire, and engaging in numerous wars. His effort to build an empire in Mexico was a fiasco. Autocratic at first, he opened the political system somewhat in the 1860s. He lost all his allies and recklessly declared war on a much more powerful Prussia in 1870; he was captured and deposed.

As 1851 opened, Louis Napoleon was not allowed by the Constitution of 1848 to seek re-election as President of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Guedalla |first=Philip |title=The Second Empire: Bonapartism, the prince, the president, the emperor |year=1922 |isbn=9780722223543 |page=203 |author-link=Philip Guedalla}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proclaimed himself Emperor of the French in 1852, with almost dictatorial powers. He made completion of a good railway system a high priority. He consolidated three dozen small, incomplete lines into six major companies using Paris as a hub. Paris grew dramatically in terms of population, industry, finance, commercial activity, and tourism. Napoleon working with [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Georges-Eugène Haussmann spent lavishly]] to rebuild the city into a world-class showpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pinkney |first=David H. |author-link=David H.

Although France had started late, by 1870 it had an excellent railway system, supported as well by good roads, canals and ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clapham |first=J.H. |title=Economic development of France and Germany 1815–1914 |date=1936 |pages=147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his promises in 1852 of a peaceful reign, the Emperor could not resist the temptations of glory in foreign affairs. He was visionary, mysterious and secretive; he had a poor staff, and kept running afoul of his domestic supporters. In the end he was incompetent as a diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zeldin |first=Theodore |title=France 1848–1945 |date=1973 |volume=1: Ambition, Love, and Politics |pages=558–560 |author-link=Theodore Zeldin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon did have some successes: he strengthened French control over Algeria, established bases in Africa, began the takeover of Indochina, and opened trade with China. He facilitated a French company building the Suez Canal, which Britain could not stop. In Europe, however, Napoleon failed again and again. The Crimean war of 1854–56 produced no gains. Napoleon had long been an admirer of Italy and wanted to see it unified, although that might create a rival power. He plotted with [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|the Italian kingdom of Piedmont]] to expel Austria and set up an Italian confederation of four new states headed by the pope. [[Second Italian War of Independence|Events in 1859]] ran out of his control. Austria was quickly defeated, but instead of four new states a popular uprising united all of Italy under Piedmont. The pope held onto Rome only because Napoleon sent troops to protect him. His reward was the [[County of Nice]] (which included the city of [[Nice]] and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. He angered Catholics when the pope lost most of his domains. Napoleon then reversed himself and angered both the anticlerical liberals at home and his erstwhile Italian allies when he protected the pope in Rome.

The British grew annoyed at Napoleon's humanitarian intervention in Syria in 1860–1861. Napoleon lowered the tariffs, which helped in the long run but in the short run angered owners of large estates and the textile and iron industrialists, while leading worried workers to organize. Matters grew worse in the 1860s as Napoleon nearly blundered into war with the United States in 1862, while his [[French intervention in Mexico|takeover of Mexico in 1861–67]] was a total disaster. [[Maximilian I of Mexico|The puppet emperor]] he put on the Mexican throne was overthrown and executed. Finally in the end he went to war with the Germans in 1870 when it was too late to stop German unification. Napoleon had alienated everyone; after failing to obtain an alliance with Austria and Italy, France had no allies and was bitterly divided at home. It was disastrously defeated on the battlefield, losing Alsace and Lorraine. Historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] was blunt: "he ruined France as a great power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=A.

====Foreign wars====
In 1854, The Second Empire joined the [[Crimean War]], which saw France and Britain opposed to the Russian Empire, which was decisively defeated at [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Sevastopol]] in 1854–55 and at [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]] in 1854. In 1856 France joined the [[Second Opium War]] on the British side against China; a missionary's murder was used as a pretext to take interests in southwest Asia in the [[Treaty of Tientsin]].

When France was negotiating with the Netherlands about purchasing Luxembourg in 1867, the Prussian Kingdom threatened the French government with war. This "[[Luxembourg Crisis]]" came as a shock to French diplomats as there had been an agreement between the Prussian and French governments about Luxembourg. Napoleon III suffered stronger and stronger criticism from Republicans like [[Jules Favre]], and his position seemed more fragile with the passage of time.

France was looking for more interests in Asia. When French imperial ambitions revived, Africa and Indochina would be the main targets, and commercial incentives, which had driven the creation of the [[French colonial empire|pre-revolutionary empire]], were secondary.{{Sfnp|Doyle|2001|pp=69+}}{{full citation needed&lt;!--two sources match Doyle 2001--&gt;|date=April 2021}} The country [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|interfered in Korea]] in 1866 taking, once again, missionaries' murders as a pretext. The French finally withdrew from the war with little gain but war's booty. The next year a [[French military mission to Japan (1867–68)|French expedition to Japan]] was formed to help the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] to modernize its army. However, Tokugawa was defeated during the [[Boshin War]] at the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]] by large Imperial armies.

====Franco-Prussian War (1870–71)====
[[File:Occupation 1871.png|thumb|Shaded areas: Occupied France after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] until [[French indemnity|war reparations]] were paid]]

Rising tensions in 1869 about the possible candidacy of Prince [[Leopold von Hohenzollern]]-Sigmaringen to the throne of Spain caused a rise in the scale of animosity between France and Germany.&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koch |first=H. W. |title=A History of Prussia |date=1978 |isbn=9780582481909 |pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Leopold was a part of the Prussian royal family. He had been asked by the Spanish [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] to accept the vacant throne of Spain.&lt;ref name=koch/&gt;

Such an event was more than France could possibly accept. Relations between France and Germany deteriorated, and finally the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) broke out. German nationalism united the German states, with the exception of Austria, against Napoleon III. The French Empire was defeated decisively at [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Metz]] and [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]]. Napoleon III surrendered himself and 100,000 French troops to the German troops at Sedan on 1–2 September 1870.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=324}}

Two days later, on 4 September 1870, [[Léon Gambetta]] proclaimed a new republic in France.{{Sfnp|Shirer|1969|p=36}} Later, when Paris was encircled by German troops, Gambetta fled Paris became the virtual dictator of the war effort which was carried on from the rural provinces.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=325}} Metz remained under siege until 27 October 1870, when 173,000 French troops there finally surrendered.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=325}} Surrounded, Paris was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=325}} The [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] allowed the newly formed German Empire to annex the provinces of [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]].{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=326}}

===Modernisation and railways (1870–1914)===
{{Main|History of rail transport in France}}
The seemingly timeless world of the French peasantry swiftly changed from 1870 to 1914. French peasants had been poor and locked into old traditions until railroads, republican schools, and universal (male) military conscription modernized rural France. The centralized government in Paris had the goal of creating a unified nation-state, so it required all students be taught standardized French. In the process, a new national identity was forged.{{Sfnp|Weber|1976}}

Railways became a national medium for the modernization of traditionalistic regions, and a leading advocate of this approach was the poet-politician [[Alphonse de Lamartine]]. In 1857 an army colonel hoped that railways might improve the lot of "populations two or three centuries behind their fellows" and eliminate "the savage instincts born of isolation and misery."{{Sfnp|Weber|1976|p=4}} Consequently, France built a centralized system that radiated from Paris (plus in the south some lines that cut east to west). This design was intended to achieve political and cultural goals rather than maximize efficiency. After some consolidation, six companies controlled monopolies of their regions, subject to close control by the government in terms of fares, finances, and even minute technical details.

The central government [[Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests|department of Ponts et Chaussées]] (bridges and roads) brought in British engineers, handled much of the construction work, provided engineering expertise and planning, land acquisition, and construction of permanent infrastructure such as the track bed, bridges and tunnels. It also subsidized militarily necessary lines along the German border. Private operating companies provided management, hired labor, laid the tracks, and built and operated stations. They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers a year or 21,200 tons of freight. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain and therefore did not stimulate machinery makers.

Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion, and forced even more reliance on temporary experts brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the [[Paris Bourse]], so France did not develop the same kind of national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached, but it did not help create local industrial centers. Critics such as Émile Zola complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it.

The railways probably helped the industrial revolution in France by facilitating a national market for raw materials, wines, cheeses, and imported manufactured products. Yet the goals set by the French for their railway system were moralistic, political, and military rather than economic. As a result, the freight trains were shorter and less heavily loaded than those in such rapidly industrializing nations such as Britain, Belgium or Germany. Other infrastructure needs in rural France, such as better roads and canals, were neglected because of the expense of the railways, so it seems likely that there were net negative effects in areas not served by the trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=O'Brien |first=Patrick |title=Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914 |date=1983 |isbn=9781349063246 |author-link=Patrick K. O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Republic and the Belle Epoque: 1871–1914===
{{Main|French Third Republic}}

====Third Republic and the Paris Commune====
Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] proposed harsh terms for peace – including the German occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=326}} A new French National Assembly was elected to consider the German terms for peace. Elected on 8 February 1871, this new National Assembly was composed of 650 deputies.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=326}}

Sitting in Bordeaux, the French National Assembly established the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. However, 400 members of the new Assembly were monarchists.{{Sfnp|Shirer|1969|p=35}} ([[Léon Gambetta]] was one of the "non-monarchist" Republicans that were elected to the new National Assembly from Paris.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|p=326}}) On 16 February 1871, [[Adolphe Thiers]] was elected as the chief executive of the new Republic. Because of the revolutionary unrest in Paris, the centre of the Thiers government was located at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].

[[File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|A barricade in the Paris Commune, 18 March 1871]]
In late 1870 to early 1871, the workers of Paris rose up in premature and unsuccessful small-scale uprisings. The National Guard within Paris had become increasingly restive and defiant of the police, the army chief of staff, and even their own National Guard commanders. Thiers immediately recognized a revolutionary situation and, on 18 March 1871, sent regular army units to take control of artillery that belonged to the National Guard of Paris. Some soldiers of the regular army units fraternized with the rebels and the revolt escalated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Paris Commune 1871 |date=1971 |isbn=978-0-41-328110-4 |editor-last=Schulkind |editor-first=Eugene |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barricades went up just as in 1830 and 1848. The [[Paris Commune]] was born. Once again the ''[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]'', or Town Hall, became the center of attention for the people in revolt; this time the ''Hôtel de Ville'' became the seat of the revolutionary government. Other cities in France followed the example of the Paris Commune, as in Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse. All of the Communes outside Paris were promptly crushed by the Thiers government.{{Sfnp|Schulkind|1971|pp=22–23}}

An election on 26 March 1871 in Paris produced a government based on the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hendriks |first=Frank |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7AeNrR5AG0C&amp;pg=PT85 |title=Vital Democracy: A Theory of Democracy in Action |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-161439-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] was in prison but a majority of delegates were his followers, called "[[Blanquists]]."{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The minority comprised anarchists and followers of [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1855);{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} as anarchists, the "Proudhonists" were supporters of limited or no government and wanted the revolution to follow an ''ad hoc'' course with little or no planning.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Analysis of arrests records indicate the typical communard was opposed to the military, the clerics, the rural aristocrats.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} He saw the bourgeoisie as the enemy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After two months the French army moved in to retake Paris, with pitched battles fought in working-class neighbourhoods. Hundreds were executed in front of the [[Communards' Wall]], while thousands of others were marched to Versailles for trials. The number killed during ''la [[semaine sanglante]]'' (The "Bloody Week" of 21–28 May 1871) was perhaps 30,000, with as many as 50,000 later executed or imprisoned; 7,000 were exiled to [[New Caledonia]]; thousands more escaped to exile. The government won approval for its actions in a national referendum with 321,000 in favor and only 54,000 opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of the Third French Republic, 1870–1940 |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-31-322080-7 |editor-last=Hutton |editor-first=Patrick H. |page=215 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political battles====
The Republican government next had to confront counterrevolutionaries who rejected the legacy of the [[1789 Revolution]]. Both the [[Legitimist]]s (embodied in the person of [[Henri, Count of Chambord]], grandson of Charles X) and the [[Orleanist]] [[monarchist|royalist]]s rejected republicanism, which they saw as an extension of [[modernity]] and atheism, breaking with France's traditions. This conflict became increasingly sharp in 1873, when Thiers himself was censured by the National Assembly as not being "sufficiently conservative" and resigned to make way for Marshal [[Patrice MacMahon]] as the new president.{{Sfnp|Guérard|1959|pp=328–329}} Amidst the rumors of right-wing intrigue and/or coups by the Bonapartists or Bourbons in 1874, the National Assembly set about drawing up a new constitution that would be acceptable to all parties.

The new constitution provided for universal male suffrage and called for a bi-cameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The initial republic was in effect led by pro-royalists, but republicans (the "[[Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party (historical)|Radicals]]") and [[Bonapartism|Bonapartists]] scrambled for power. The first election under this new constitution — held in early 1876 — resulted in a republican victory, with 363 republicans elected as opposed to 180 monarchists. However, 75 of the monarchists elected to the new Chamber of Deputies were Bonapartists.{{Sfnp|Shirer|1969|p=39}}

The possibility of a [[coup d'état]] was an ever-present factor. [[Léon Gambetta]] chose moderate [[Armand Dufaure]] as premier but he failed to form a government.{{Sfnp|Shirer|1969|p=39}} MacMahon next chose conservative [[Jules Simon]]. He too failed, setting the stage for the [[16 May 1877 crisis]], which led to the resignation of MacMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fortescue |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzfBh4eQsPQC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=The Third Republic in France, 1870–1940: Conflicts and Continuities |date=2000 |isbn=978-0-41-516945-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A restoration of the king now seemed likely, and royalists agreed on [[Henri, comte de Chambord]], the grandson of Charles X. He insisted on an impossible demand and ruined the royalist cause. Its turn never came again as the Orleanist faction rallied themselves to the Republic, behind Adolphe Thiers. The new President of the Republic in 1879 was [[Jules Grevy]]. In January 1886, [[Georges Boulanger]] became Minister of War. Georges Clemanceau was instrumental in obtaining this appointment for Boulanger. This was the start of the Boulanger era and another time of threats of a coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tilley |first=Arthur Augustus |title=Modern France: A Companion to French Studies |date=1967 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=978-0-72-222339-0 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legitimist (Bourbon) faction mostly left politics but one segment founded ''[[L'Action Française]]'' in 1898, during the [[Dreyfus Affair]]; it became an influential movement throughout the 1930s, in particular among the conservative Catholic intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weber |first=Eugen |title=Action Française: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France |date=1962 |isbn=978-0-80-470134-1 |author-link=Eugen Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solidarism and Radical Party====
While liberalism was individualistic and laissez-faire in Britain and the United States, in France liberalism was based instead on a solidaristic conception of society, following the theme of the French Revolution, ''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]'' ("liberty, equality, fraternity"). In the Third Republic, especially between 1895 and 1914 "Solidarité" ["solidarism"] was the guiding concept of a liberal social policy, whose chief champions were the prime ministers [[Leon Bourgeois]] (1895–96) and [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau]] (1899–1902)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hayward |first=Jack |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZgSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |title=Fragmented France: Two Centuries of Disputed Identity |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-921631-4 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 1879 to 1914 saw power mostly in the hands of moderate republicans and "radicals"; they avoided state ownership of industry and had a middle class political base. Their main policies were governmental intervention (financed by a progressive income tax) to provide a social safety net. They opposed church schools. They expanded educational opportunities and promoted consumers' and producers' cooperatives. In terms of foreign policy they supported the League of Nations, compulsory arbitration, controlled disarmament, and economic sanctions to keep the peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayward |first=Jack |date=1961 |title=The official social philosophy of the French Third Republic: Léon Bourgeois and solidarism |journal=[[International Review of Social History]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=19–48|doi=10.1017/S0020859000001759 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French welfare state expanded when it tried to followed some of Bismarck's policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Allan |date=1991 |title=The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870 |isbn=978-1-46-962292-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nord |first=Philip |jstor=286694 |title=The welfare state in France, 1870–1914 |date=Spring 1994 |journal=[[French Historical Studies]] |volume=18 |issue=3|pages=821–838 |doi=10.2307/286694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with relief for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weiss |first=John H. |date=Spring 1983 |title=Origins of the French welfare state: poor relief in the third republic, 1871–1914 |jstor=286593 |journal=[[French Historical Studies]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=47–78 |doi=10.2307/286593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy====
{{Main|History of French foreign relations}}
French foreign policy from 1871 to 1914 showed a dramatic transformation from a humiliated power with no friends and not much of an empire in 1871, to the centerpiece of the European alliance system in 1914, with a flourishing empire that was second in size only to Great Britain. Although religion was a hotly contested matter and domestic politics, the Catholic Church made missionary work and church building a specialty in the colonies. Most Frenchman ignored foreign policy; its issues were a low priority in politics.{{Sfnp|Wright|1995|pp=288–299}}

French foreign policy was based on a fear of Germany—whose larger size and fast-growing economy could not be matched—combined with a revanchism that demanded the return of Alsace and Lorraine. At the same time, in the midst of the [[Scramble for Africa]], French and British interest in Africa came into conflict. The most dangerous episode was the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898 when French troops tried to claim an area in the Southern Sudan, and a British force purporting to be acting in the interests of the [[Khedive of Egypt]] arrived. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]], but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brogan |first=D.W. |title=France under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870–1930) |date=1940 |pages=321–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Suez Canal]], initially built by the French, became a joint British-French project in 1875, as both saw it as vital to maintaining their influence and empires in Asia. In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France. France's leading expansionist [[Jules Ferry]] was out of office, and the government allowed Britain to take effective control of Egypt.{{Sfnp|Taylor|1954|pp=286–292}}

France had colonies in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. During his visit to France, [[Iwakura Tomomi]] asked for French assistance in reforming Japan. French military missions were sent to Japan in [[French military mission to Japan (1872–1880)|1872–1880]], in [[French military mission to Japan (1884–1889)|1884–1889]] and the last one much later in [[French military mission to Japan (1918–1919)|1918–1919]] to help modernize the Japanese army. Conflicts between the Chinese Emperor and the French Republic over Indochina climaxed during the [[Sino-French War]] (1884–1885). [[Amédée Courbet|Admiral Courbet]] destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at [[Battle of Foochow|Foochow]]. The treaty ending the war, put France in a protectorate over northern and central Vietnam, which it divided into [[Tonkin]] and [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]].&lt;ref name="wak"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wakeman |first=Frederic Jr. |title=The Fall of Imperial China |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-02-933680-9 |pages=189–191 |author-link=Frederic Wakeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain, first by means of the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, then the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907, which became the [[Triple Entente]]. This alliance with Britain and Russia against Germany and Austria eventually led Russia and Britain to enter World War I as France's Allies.{{Sfnp|Taylor|1954|pp=345, 403–426}}

====Dreyfus Affair====
Distrust of Germany, faith in the army, and native French [[anti-semitism]] combined to make the [[Dreyfus Affair]] (the unjust trial and condemnation of a Jewish military officer for "treason" in 1894) a political scandal of the utmost gravity. For a decade, the nation was divided between "dreyfusards" and "anti-dreyfusards", and far-right Catholic agitators inflamed the situation even when proofs of Dreyfus's innocence came to light. The writer [[Émile Zola]] published an impassioned editorial on the injustice (''[[J'Accuse…!]]'') and was himself condemned by the government for libel. Dreyfus was finally pardoned in 1906. The upshot was a weakening of the conservative element in politics. Moderates were deeply divided over the [[Dreyfus Affair]], and this allowed the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]] to hold power from 1899 until World War I. During this period, crises like the threatened "Boulangist" coup d'état (1889) showed the fragility of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Piers Paul |last=Read |title=The Dreyfus Affair: The Scandal That Tore France in Two |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-40-880139-0 |author-link=Piers Paul Read}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religion 1870–1924====
{{Main|Religion in France# History}}
Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the Monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and of boards of charity. In 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations. From 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals. Napoleon's 1801 Concordat continued in operation but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Philippe |last1=Rigoulot |title=Protestants and the French nation under the Third Republic: Between recognition and assimilation |journal=[[National Identities]] |date=March 2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=45–57|doi=10.1080/14608940802680961 |s2cid=145338843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1882 school laws of Republican [[Jules Ferry]] set up a national system of public schools that taught strict puritanical morality but no religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Barnett B. |last=Singer |title=Minoritarian Religion and the Creation of a Secular School System in France |journal=Third Republic |date=Fall 1976 |issue=2 |pages=228–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while privately funded Catholic schools were tolerated. Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced and chaplains were removed from the army.{{Sfnp|Harrigan|2001|pp=51–83}}

When [[Leo XIII]] became pope in 1878 he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884 he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In 1892 he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed.&lt;ref name=Tallett&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Tallett |first2=Nicholas |last2=Atkin |title=Religion, society, and politics in France since 1789 |date=1991 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Catholics were for the most part anti-dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal ''La Croix''. This infuriated Republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry]] (1899–1902) and the [[Émile Combes|Combes Ministry (1902–05)]] fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals (1903–04), and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs (1904). Combes as Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain.&lt;ref name=Tallett/&gt;

In [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 the 1801 Concordat was abrogated; Church and State were separated.]] All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. In practise, Masses and rituals continued. The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests. In the long run, however, it gained autonomy—for the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.{{Sfnp|Gildea|2008|loc=ch. 12}} Conservative Catholics regain control of Parliament In 1919 and reversed most of the penalties imposed on the Church, and gave bishops back control of church lands and buildings.

====''Belle époque''====
The end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' because of peace, prosperity and the cultural innovations of Monet, Bernhardt, and Debussy, and popular amusements — [[cabaret]], [[can-can]], the [[film|cinema]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Rearick |title=Pleasures of the Belle Epoque: Entertainment and Festivity in Turn-of-the-Century France |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; new art forms such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Mary |last=McAuliffe |title=Dawn of the Belle Epoque: The Paris of Monet, Zola, Bernhardt, Eiffel, Debussy, Clemenceau, and Their Friends |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] showed off newly modernised Paris to the world, which could look over it all from atop the new [[Eiffel Tower]]. Meant to last only a few decades, the tower was never removed and became France's most iconic landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hervé |first1=Lucien |title=The Eiffel Tower |last2=Bergdoll |first2=Barry |date=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/eiffeltower00herv/page/16 16] |author-link=Lucien Hervé |isbn=978-1-56-898372-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France was nevertheless a nation divided internally on notions of ideology, religion, class, regionalisms, and money. On the international front, France came repeatedly to the brink of war with the other imperial powers, such as the 1898 [[Fashoda Incident]] with Great Britain over East Africa.

==Colonial empire==
{{Main|French colonial empire}}
[[File:French Empire 17th century-20th century.png|thumb|French empire, 17th-20th centuries.&lt;br/&gt;Dark blue = second empire 1830–1960]]

The second colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the "first colonial empire", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the "second colonial empire", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second colonial empire came to an end after the loss in later wars [[First Indochina War|of Vietnam]] (1954) and [[Algerian War|Algeria]] (1962), and relatively peaceful [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonizations]] elsewhere after 1960.{{Sfnp|Aldrich|1996}}
{{See also|Evolution of the French Empire}}

France lost wars to Britain that stripped away nearly all of its colonies by 1765. France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|their own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, especially supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chafer |first=Tony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&amp;pg=PA84 |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |date=2002 |isbn=9781859735572 |pages=84–85 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314200825/http://eprints.port.ac.uk/3567 |archive-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a moral mission to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture. In 1884, the leading proponent of colonialism, [[Jules Ferry]], declared; "The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a [[Civilizing mission|duty to civilize the inferior races]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatamis.info/medias/controle_citoyen/ferry-jules.htm |title=FERRY, Jules|access-date=2006-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825083658/http://www.tatamis.info/medias/controle_citoyen/ferry-jules.htm |archive-date=25 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full citizenship rights — ''assimilation'' — were offered. In reality the French settlers were given full rights and the natives given very limited rights. Apart from Algeria few settlers permanently settled in its colonies. Even in Algeria, the "[[Pied-Noir]]" (French settlers) always remained a small minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Martin |last=Evans |title=Empire and culture: the French experience, 1830–1940 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its apex, it was [[List of largest empires|one of the largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939. In World War II, the [[Free French]] used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France. "In an effort to restore its world-power status after the humiliation of defeat and occupation, France was eager to maintain its overseas empire at the end of the Second World War."{{Sfnp|Chafer|2002}} However, after 1945 [[Anti-colonial liberation movements|anti-colonial movements]] successfully challenged European authority. The [[French Constitution of 27 October 1946]] ([[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic. These now total about 1% of the pre-1939 colonial area, with 2.7 million people living in them in 2013. By the 1970s, the last "vestiges of empire held little interest for the French. … Except for the traumatic decolonization of Algeria, however, what is remarkable is how few long-lasting effects on France the giving up of empire entailed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Robert |last=Aldrich |title=Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion |date=1996 |author-link=Robert Aldrich (historian) |pages=304–305}}, His section on "Ending the Empire" closes in 1980 with the independence of New Hebrides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population trends===
{{Main|Demographics of France}}
The population held steady from 40.7 million in 1911, to 41.5 million in 1936. The sense that the population was too small, especially in regard to the rapid growth of more powerful Germany, was a common theme in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Joseph J. |last=Spengler |title=France Faces Depopulation |date=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natalist policies were proposed in the 1930s, and implemented in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Marie-Monique |last=Huss |title=Pronatalism in the inter-war period in France |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |date=1990 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=39–68 |doi=10.1177/002200949002500102 |jstor=260720|s2cid=162316833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Leslie |last=King |title='France needs children' |journal=[[Sociological Quarterly]] |date=1998 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=33–52|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1998.tb02348.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

France experienced a [[baby boom]] after 1945; it reversed a long-term record of low birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Colin L. |last=Dyer |title=Population and Society in 20th Century France |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-84-190308-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there was a steady immigration, especially from former French colonies in North Africa. The population grew from 41 million in 1946, to 50 million in 1966, and 60 million by 1990. The farming population declined sharply, from 35% of the workforce in 1945 to under 5% by 2000. By 2004, France had the second highest birthrate in Europe, behind only Ireland.{{Sfnp|Jones|2004|p=438}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Gilles  |last=Pison |title=La population de la France en 2005 |journal=Population et Sociétés | date=March 2006 |issue=421 |url=http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/jean-luc.richard/telechargement_fichier_fr_publi_pdf1_pop_et_soc_francais_421.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
{{See also|French entry into World War I|French Army in World War I|Home front during World War I#France}}[[File:French bayonet charge.jpg|thumb|A French bayonet charge in 1913]]
[[File:El 114 de infantería, en París, el 14 de julio de 1917, León Gimpel.jpg|thumb|The 114th infantry in Paris, 14 July 1917]]

France did not expect war in 1914, but when it came in August the entire nation rallied enthusiastically for two years. It specialized in sending infantry forward again and again, only to be stopped again and again by German artillery, trenches, barbed wire and machine guns, with horrific casualty rates. Despite the loss of major industrial districts France produced an enormous output of munitions that armed both the French and the American armies. By 1917 the infantry was on the verge of mutiny, with a widespread sense that it was now the American turn to storm the German lines. But they rallied and defeated the greatest German offensive, which came in spring 1918, then rolled over the collapsing invaders. November 1918 brought a surge of pride and unity, and an unrestrained demand for revenge.

Preoccupied with internal problems, France paid little attention to foreign policy in the 1911–14 period, although it did extend military service to three years from two over strong Socialist objections in 1913. The rapidly escalating [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] caught France unaware, and it played only a small role in [[Causes of World War I|the coming of World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Joachim |last=Remak |title=1914— The Third Balkan War: Origins Reconsidered |journal=[[Journal of Modern History]] |volume=43 |issue=3 |date=1971 |pages=354–366, quote at 354–355|doi=10.1086/240647 |s2cid=222445579 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian crisis triggered a complex set of military alliances between European states, causing most of the continent, including France, to be drawn into war within a few short weeks. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in late July, triggering Russian mobilization. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered mobilization. Germany was much better prepared militarily than any of the other countries involved, including France. The German Empire, as an ally of Austria, declared war on Russia. France was allied with Russia and so was ready to commit to war against the German Empire. On 3 August Germany declared war on France, and sent its armies through neutral Belgium. Britain entered the war on 4 August, and started sending in troops on 7 August. Italy, although tied to Germany, remained neutral and then joined the Allies in 1915.

[[Schlieffen Plan|Germany's "Schlieffen Plan"]] was to quickly defeat the French. They captured [[city of Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]] by 20 August and soon had captured a large portion of northern France. The original plan was to continue southwest and attack Paris from the west. By early September they were within {{Convert|65|km|mi}} of Paris, and the French government had relocated to Bordeaux. The Allies finally stopped the advance northeast of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne River]] (5–12 September 1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Herwig |first=Holger H. |title=The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle That Changed the World |date=2011 |orig-date=2009 |isbn=978-0-81-297829-2 |pages=266–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war now became a stalemate – the famous "[[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]" was fought largely in France and was characterized by very little movement despite extremely large and violent battles, often with new and more destructive military technology. On the Western Front, the small improvised trenches of the first few months rapidly grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. The land war quickly became dominated by the muddy, bloody stalemate of [[Trench warfare]], a form of war in which both opposing armies had static lines of defense. The war of movement quickly turned into a war of position. Neither side advanced much, but both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. German and Allied armies produced essentially a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium. Meanwhile, large swaths of northeastern France came under the brutal control of German occupiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Helen |last=McPhail |title=The Long Silence: The Tragedy of Occupied France in World War I |isbn=978-1-78-453053-2 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from September 1914 until March 1918. Famous battles in France include [[Battle of Verdun]] (spanning 10 months from 21 February to 18 December 1916), [[Battle of the Somme]] (1 July to 18 November 1916), and five separate conflicts called the [[Battle of Ypres]] (from 1914 to 1918).

After Socialist leader [[Jean Jaurès]], a pacifist, was assassinated at the start of the war, the French socialist movement abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort. Prime Minister [[Rene Viviani]] called for unity—for a "[[Union sacrée]]" ("Sacred Union")--Which was a wartime truce between the right and left factions that had been fighting bitterly. France had few dissenters. However, [[war-weariness]] was a major factor by 1917, even reaching the army. The soldiers were reluctant to attack; Mutiny was a factor as soldiers said it was best to wait for the arrival of millions of Americans. The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Leonard V. |last=Smith |title=War and 'Politics': The French Army Mutinies of 1917 |journal=[[War in History]] |date=April 1995 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=180–201|doi=10.1177/096834459500200203 |s2cid=154834826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating Russia in 1917, Germany now could concentrate on the Western Front, and planned an all-out assault in the spring of 1918, but had to do it before the very rapidly growing American army played a role. In March 1918 Germany launched its offensive and by May had reached the Marne and was again close to Paris. However, in the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] (15 July to 6 August 1918), the Allied line held. The Allies then shifted to the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Michael S. |last=Neiberg |author-link=Michael S. Neiberg |title=The Second Battle of the Marne |isbn=978-0-25-335146-3 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans, out of reinforcements, were overwhelmed day after day and the high command saw it was hopeless. Austria and Turkey collapsed, and the Kaiser's government fell. Germany signed "[[Armistice with Germany|The Armistice]]" that ended the fighting effective 11 November 1918, "the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Harry |last=Rudin |title=Armistice, 1918 |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime losses===
The war was fought in large part on French soil, with 3.4&amp;nbsp;million French dead including civilians, and four times as many military casualties. The economy was hurt by the German invasion of major industrial areas in the northeast. While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Gerd |last=Hardach |title=The First World War: 1914–1918 |date=1977 |pages=87–88 |isbn=978-0-52-003060-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfnp|McPhail|2014}} In 1914 the government implemented a [[war economy]] with controls and rationing. By 1915 the war economy went into high gear, as millions of French women and colonial men replaced the civilian roles of many of the 3 million soldiers. Considerable assistance came with the influx of American food, money and raw materials in 1917. This war economy would have important reverberations after the war, as it would be a first breach of liberal theories of non-interventionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Pierre-Cyrille  |last=Hautcoeur |title=Chapter 6: Was the Great War a watershed?

The national debt rose from 66% of GDP in 1913 to 170% in 1919, reflecting the heavy use of bond issues to pay for the war. Inflation was severe, with the franc losing over half its value against the British pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1=Paul |last1=Beaudry |first2=Franck |last2=Portier |title=The French depression in the 1930s |journal=[[Review of Economic Dynamics]] |date=2002 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=73–99|doi=10.1006/redy.2001.0143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The richest families were hurt, as the top 1 percent saw their share of wealth drop from about 60% in 1914 to 36% in 1935, then plunge to 20 percent in 1970 to the present. A great deal of physical and financial damage was done during the world wars, foreign investments were cashed in to pay for the wars, the Russian Bolsheviks expropriated large-scale investments, postwar inflation demolished cash holdings, stocks and bonds plunged during the Great Depression, and progressive taxes ate away at accumulated wealth.{{Sfnp|Piketty|2014|pp=339–345}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Thomas |last=Piketty |title=Top Incomes in France in the Twentieth Century: Inequality and Redistribution, 1901–1998 |date=2018 |pages=101–148, 468–477 |author-link=Thomas Piketty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar settlement===
[[File:Council of Four Versailles.jpg|thumb|The Council of Four (from left to right): [[David Lloyd George]], [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]], [[Georges Clemenceau]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] in Versailles]]
Peace terms were imposed by the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]], meeting in Paris in 1919: [[David Lloyd George]] of Britain, [[Vittorio Orlando]] of Italy, [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States. Clemenceau demanded the harshest terms and won most of them in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919. Germany was forced to admit its guilt for starting the war, and was permanently weakened militarily. Germany had to pay huge sums in [[war reparations]] to the Allies (who in turn had large loans from the U.S. to pay off).&lt;ref name="Patrick O.

France regained Alsace-Lorraine and occupied the German industrial [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar Basin]], a coal and steel region. The [[German colonial empire|German African colonies]] were put under [[League of Nations]] mandates, and were administered by France and other victors. From the remains of the [[Ottoman Empire]], France acquired the [[French Mandate of Syria|Mandate of Syria]] and the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Mandate of Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Patrick O.

France was part of the Allied force that [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied the Rhineland]] following the Armistice. Foch supported Poland in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–19)|Greater Poland Uprising]] and in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] and France also joined Spain during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]]. From 1925 until his death in 1932, [[Aristide Briand]], as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with [[Weimar Germany]] as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the [[League of Nations]]. He realized France could neither contain the much larger Germany by itself nor secure effective support from Britain or the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weber |first=Eugen |title=The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-39-331479-3 |page=125 |author-link=Eugen Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the failure of the Weimar Republic to pay reparations in the aftermath of World War I, France occupied the industrial region of the [[Ruhr]] as a means of ensuring repayments from Germany. The intervention was a failure, and France accepted the American solution to the reparations issues, as expressed in the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]].

In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of border defences called the [[Maginot Line]], designed to fight off any German attack. The Line did not extend into Belgium, which Germany would exploit in 1940. Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920–21, called the "[[Little Entente]]".

The [[Great Depression in France|Great Depression affected France]] a bit later than other countries, hitting around 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Laufenburger |first=Henry |date=1936 |title=France and the Depression |journal=International Affairs |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=202–224 |jstor=2601740}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the GDP in the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, the 1930s rate fell to only 0.63%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dormois |first=Jean-Pierre |title=The French Economy in the Twentieth Century |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-52-166092-1 |page=31 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511616969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Beaudry |first1=Paul |last2=Portier |first2=Franck |date=2002 |title=The French Depression in the 1930s |journal=[[Review of Economic Dynamics]] |volume=5 |issue=73–99 |pages=73–99 |doi=10.1006/redy.2001.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast to the mild economic upheaval, the political upheaval was enormous. Socialist [[Leon Blum]], leading the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], brought together Socialists and Radicals to become Prime Minister from 1936 to 1937; he was the first Jew and the first Socialist to lead France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Birnbaum |first=Pierre |title=Léon Blum: Prime Minister, Socialist, Zionist |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-30-021373-7 |author-link=Pierre Birnbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] voted to keep the government in power, and generally supported the government's economic policies, but rejected its foreign policies. The Popular Front passed numerous labor reforms, which increased wages, cut working hours to 40 hours with overtime illegal and provided many lesser benefits to the working class such as mandatory two-week paid vacations. However, renewed inflation canceled the gains in wage rates, unemployment did not fall, and economic recovery was very slow. The Popular Front failed in economics, foreign policy, and long-term stability: "Disappointment and failure was the legacy of the Popular Front."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jackson |first=Julian |title=Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934–1938 |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-52-131252-3 |pages=172, 215, 278–287, quotation on page 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Douglas |title=Léon Blum and the Popular Front |date=1970 |work=[[History Today]] |volume=55 |pages=199–206 |issue=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bernard |first1=Philippe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFLMJnHQaGwC&amp;pg=PA328 |title=The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914–1938 |last2=Dubief |first2=Henri |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-52-135854-5 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the Popular Front created enormous excitement and expectations on the left—including very large scale sitdown strikes—but in the end it failed to live up to its promise.

The government joined Britain in establishing an arms embargo during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). Blum rejected support for the Spanish Republicans because of his fear that civil war might spread to deeply-divided France. Financial support in military cooperation with Poland was also a policy. The government nationalized arms suppliers, and dramatically increased its program of rearming the French military in a last-minute catch up with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Larkin |first=Maurice |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936–1986 |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |pages=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Appeasement]] of Germany, in cooperation with Britain, was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace even in the face of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s escalating demands. [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Daladier]] refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support as [[Neville Chamberlain]] wanted to [[Munich Agreement|save peace at Munich]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thomas |first=Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJXqvBz3JHcC&amp;pg=PA137 |title=Britain, France and Appeasement: Anglo-French Relations in the Popular Front Era |date=1996 |isbn=978-1-85-973192-5 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfnp|Larkin|1988|pp=63–81}}

Germany's [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939 finally caused France and Britain to declare war against Germany. But the Allies did not launch massive assaults and instead kept a defensive stance: this was called the [[Phoney War]] in Britain or ''Drôle de guerre'' — the funny sort of war — in France. It did not prevent the German army from conquering Poland in a matter of weeks with its innovative [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics, also helped by the Soviet Union's attack on Poland.

When Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, the [[Battle of France]] began in May 1940, and the same [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics proved just as devastating there. The [[Wehrmacht]] bypassed the [[Maginot Line]] by marching through the Ardennes forest. A second German force was sent into Belgium and the Netherlands to act as a diversion to this main thrust. In six weeks of savage fighting the French lost 90,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The French Defeat of 1940 |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford |editor-last=Blatt |editor-first=Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Doughty |first=Robert A. |title=The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many civilians sought refuge by taking to the roads of France: some 2 million refugees from Belgium and the Netherlands were joined by between 8 and 10 million French civilians, representing a quarter of the French population, all heading south and west. This movement may well have been the largest single movement of civilians in history prior to 1947.

Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, but not before the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] was evacuated from [[Dunkirk]], along with many French soldiers.

[[Vichy France]] was established on 10 July 1940 to govern the unoccupied part of France and its colonies. It was led by [[Philippe Pétain]], the aging war hero of the First World War. Petain's representatives signed a harsh [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice]] on 22 June 1940 whereby Germany kept most of the French army in camps in Germany, and France had to pay out large sums in gold and food supplies. Germany occupied three-fifths of France's territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government. However, in practice, most local government was handled by the traditional French officialdom. In November 1942 all of Vichy France was finally occupied by German forces. Vichy continued in existence but it was closely supervised by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Paxton |first=Robert O. |title=Vichy France, Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944 |date=1972 |isbn=9780394473604 |author-link=Robert Paxton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jackson |first=Julian |title=France: The Dark Years, 1940–1944 |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-925457-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vichy regime sought to collaborate with Germany, keeping peace in France to avoid further occupation although at the expense of personal freedom and individual safety. Some 76,000 Jews were deported during the German occupation, often with the help of the Vichy authorities, and murdered in the Nazis' [[extermination camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Marrus |first=Michael |title=Vichy France and the Jews |date=1995 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in Vichy France ====
{{See also|Women in the French Resistance}}
The 2 million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families. It gave women a key symbolic role to carry out the national regeneration. It used propaganda, women's organizations, and legislation to promote maternity, patriotic duty, and female submission to marriage, home, and children's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Diamond |first=Hanna |title=Women and the Second World War in France 1939–1948: Choices and Constraints |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-58-229910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were very difficult for housewives, as food was short as well as most necessities. Divorce laws were made much more stringent, and restrictions were placed on the employment of married women. Family allowances that had begun in the 1930s were continued, and became a vital lifeline for many families; it was a monthly cash bonus for having more children. In 1942 the birth rate started to rise, and [[Demographics of France#After World War II|by 1945 it was higher than it had been for a century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Muel-Dreyfus |first1=Francine |title=Vichy and the Eternal Feminine: A Contribution to a Political-Sociology of Gender |last2=Johnson |first2=Kathleen A. |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-82-232777-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resistance====
General [[Charles de Gaulle]] in London declared himself on BBC radio to be the head of a rival government in exile, and gathered the [[Free French Forces]] around him, finding support in some French colonies and recognition from Britain but not the United States. After the [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir]] in 1940, where the British fleet destroyed a large part of the French navy, still under command of [[Vichy France]], that killed about 1,100 sailors, there was nationwide indignation and a feeling of distrust in the French forces, leading to the events of the [[Battle of Dakar]]. Eventually, several important French ships joined the Free French Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martin |first=Thomas |date=1997 |title=After Mers-el-Kébir: The Armed Neutrality of the Vichy French Navy, 1940–1943 |journal=[[English Historical Review]] |volume=112 |issue=447 |pages=643–670 |jstor=576348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy and avoided recognition of de Gaulle's claim to be the one and only government of France. Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Viorst |first=Milton |title=Hostile allies: FDR and Charles de Gaulle |date=1967 |author-link=Milton Viorst}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Haglund |first=David G. |title=Roosevelt as 'Friend of France'—But Which One? |date=2007 |work=[[Diplomatic History (journal)|Diplomatic history]] |volume=31 |pages=883–908 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within France proper, the organized underground grew as the Vichy regime resorted to more strident policies in order to fulfill the enormous demands of the Nazis and the eventual decline of Nazi Germany became more obvious. They formed [[French Resistance|the Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kedward |first=H. R. |title=In Search of the Maquis |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-19-159178-5 |author-link=Rod Kedward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous figure of the French resistance was [[Jean Moulin]], sent in France by de Gaulle in order to link all resistance movements; he was captured and tortured by [[Klaus Barbie]] (the "butcher of Lyon"). Increasing repression culminated in the complete destruction and extermination of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] at the height of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]. At 2.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 10 June 1944, a company of the 2nd SS Panzer Division, 'Das Reich', entered Oradour-sur-Glane. They herded most of its population into barns, garages and the church, and then massacred 642 men, women and children, all of whom were civilians.

In 1953, 21 men went on trial in Bordeaux for the Oradour killings. Fourteen of the accused proved to be French citizens of Alsace. Following convictions, all but one were pardoned by the French government.

On 6 June 1944 the Allies [[D-Day|landed in Normandy]] (without a French component); on 15 August Allied forces [[Operation Dragoon|landing in Provence]], this time they included 260,000 men of the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]]. The German lines finally broke, and they fled back to Germany while keeping control of the major ports. Allied forces liberated France and the Free French were given the honor of [[Liberation of Paris|liberating Paris]] in late August 1944. The French army recruited [[French Forces of the Interior]] (de Gaulle's formal name for resistance fighters) to continue the war until the final defeat of Germany; this army numbered 300,000 men by September 1944 and 370,000 by spring 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Funk |first=Arthur Layton |url=http://www.questia.com/read/58600747 |title=Charles de Gaulle: The Crucial Years, 1943–1944 |date=1959 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215323/http://www.questia.com/read/58600747 |archive-date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vichy regime disintegrated. An interim [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] was quickly put into place by de Gaulle. The ''gouvernement provisoire de la République française'', or GPRF, operated under a ''tripartisme'' alliance of communists, socialists, and democratic republicans. The GPRF governed France from 1944 to 1946, when it was replaced by the [[French Fourth Republic]]. Tens of thousands of collaborators were executed without trial. The new government declared the Vichy laws unconstitutional and illegal, and elected new local governments. Women gained the right to vote.

==Since 1945==
{{See also|French Fourth Republic|French Fifth Republic|History of French foreign relations}}
The political scene in 1944–45 was controlled by the Resistance, but it had numerous factions. Charles de Gaulle and the Free France element had been based outside France, but now came to dominate, in alliance with the Socialists, the Christian Democrats (MRP), and what remained of the Radical party. The Communists had largely dominated the Resistance inside France, but cooperated closely with the government in 1944–45, on orders from the Kremlin. There was a general consensus that important powers that had been an open collaboration with the Germans should be nationalized, such as [[Renault]] automobiles and the [[History of French journalism|major newspapers]]. A new Social Security system was called for, as well as important new concessions to the labor unions. Unions themselves were divided among communist, Socialist, and Christian Democrat factions.&lt;ref&gt;George Ross, ''Workers and Communists in France: From Popular Front to Eurocommunism'' (1982) pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Frustrated by his inability to control all the dominant forces, de Gaulle resigned early in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fenby, ''The General: Charles de Gaulle and The France He Saved'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 1946, a new constitution established the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. The Fourth Republic consisted of a parliamentary government controlled by a series of coalitions. France attempted to [[First Indochina War|regain control of French Indochina]] but was defeated by the [[Viet Minh]] in 1954. Only months later, France faced another [[anti-colonialist]] [[Algerian War|conflict in Algeria]] and the debate over whether or not to keep control of [[French Algeria|Algeria]], then home to over one million [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |date=4 March 2009 |title=In France, a War of Memories Over Memories of War |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/arts/design/05abroad.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; wracked the country and nearly led to a [[May 1958 crisis|coup]] and civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crozier |first1=Brian |last2=Mansell, Gerard |date=July 1960 |title=France and Algeria |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=310–321 |doi=10.2307/2610008 |jstor=2610008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war. The Algerian War was concluded with the [[Évian Accords]] in 1962 that led to Algerian independence.

===Economic recovery===
Wartime damage to the economy was severe, and apart from gold reserves, France had inadequate resources to recover on its own. The transportation system was in total shambles — the Allies had bombed out the railways and the bridges, and the Germans had destroyed the port facilities. Energy was in extremely short supply, with very low stocks of coal and oil. Imports of raw material were largely cut off, so most factories had shut down. The invaders had stripped most of the valuable industrial tools for German factories. Discussions with the United States for emergency aid dragged on, with repeated postponements on both sides. Meanwhile, several million French prisoners of war and forced laborers were being returned home, with few jobs and little food available for them. The plan was for 20 percent of German reparations to be paid to France, but Germany was in much worse shape even in France, and in no position to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Footitt and John Simmonds, ''France, 1943–1945'' (1988) pp. 215–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the diplomatic logjam was broken in terms of American aid. Lend Lease had barely restarted When it was unexpectedly handed in August 1945. The U.S. Army shipped in food, 1944–1946. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945–47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948–51). There was post-Marshall aid (1951–55) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment. The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator [[Jean Monnet]] set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Irwin M. Wall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnS4wOYyuCgC&amp;pg=PA55 |title=The United States and the Making of Postwar France, 1945–1954 |date=1991 |isbn=9780521402170 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marshall Plan]] gave France $2.3 billion with no repayment. The total of all American grants and credits to France from 1946 to 1953, amounted to $4.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1954'' (1955) table 1075 p. 899 [http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1954.zip online edition file 1954-08.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A central feature of the Marshall Plan was to encourage international trade, reduce tariffs, lower barriers, and modernize French management. The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry. France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices. They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, F. Kuisel, ''Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization'' (1993) pp. 70–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French businesses resisted Americanization, but the most profitable, especially chemicals, oil, electronics, and instrumentation, seized upon the opportunity to attract American investments and build a larger market.&lt;ref&gt;Laureen Kuo, "Improving French Competitiveness through American Investment following World War II." ''Business History Review'' 91#1 (2017): 129–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. insisted on opportunities for Hollywood films, and the French film industry responded with new life.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Le Forestier, "L'accueil en France des films américains de réalisateurs français à l'époque des accords Blum-Byrnes." ["The reception in France of American films by French directors during the Blum-Byrnes agreements"] ''Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine'' 4 (2004): 78–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the economic situation in France was grim in 1945, resources did exist and the economy regained normal growth by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Fohlen, "France, 1920–1970" in Carlo M. Cipolla, ed. ''The Fontana Economic History of Europe: Vol.6 Part 1: Contemporary Economies, part 1'' (1976) pp. 72–127.&lt;/ref&gt; France managed to regain its international status thanks to a successful production strategy, a demographic spurt, and technical and political innovations. Conditions varied from firm to firm. Some had been destroyed or damaged, nationalized or requisitioned, but the majority carried on, sometimes working harder and more efficiently than before the war. Industries were reorganized on a basis that ranged from consensual (electricity) to conflictual (machine tools), therefore producing uneven results. Despite strong American pressure through the ERP, there was little change in the organization and content of the training for French industrial managers. This was mainly due to the reticence of the existing institutions and the struggle among different economic and political interest groups for control over efforts to improve the further training of practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=John S. |last=Hill |title=American Efforts to Aid French Reconstruction Between Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan |journal=[[Journal of Modern History]] |date=1992 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=500–524 |doi=10.1086/244513 |jstor=2124596|s2cid=144892957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Monnet Plan]] provided a coherent framework for economic policy, and it was strongly supported by the Marshall Plan. It was inspired by moderate, Keynesian free-trade ideas rather than state control. Although relaunched in an original way, the French economy was about as productive as comparable West European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Mioche, "Le Demarrage de l'economie Française au lendemain de la Guerre," [Restarting the French Economy after the War]. ''Historiens et Géographes'' 1998 89(361): 143–156. Issn: 0046-757x&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude Fohlen argues that:
: in all then, France received 7000 million dollars, which were used either to finance the imports needed to get the economy off the ground again or to implement the Monnet Plan….Without the Marshall Plan, however, the economic recovery would have been a much slower process — particularly in France, where American aid provided funds for the Monnet Plan and thereby restored equilibrium in the equipment industries, which govern the recovery of consumption, and opened the way… To continuing further growth. This growth was affected by a third factor… decolonization.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Fohlen, "France" pp. 102–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam and Algeria===
[[Pierre Mendès France]], was a [[Radical Party (France)|Radical party leader]] who was Prime Minister for eight months in 1954–55, working with the support of the Socialist and Communist parties. His top priority was ending the war in Indochina, which had already cost 92,000 dead 114,000 wounded and 28,000 captured in the wake of the humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Windrow, ''The French Indochina War 1946–54'' (Osprey Publishing, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had paid most of the costs of the war, but its support inside France had collapsed. Public opinion polls showed that in February 1954, only 7% of the French people wanted to continue the fight to keep Indochina out of the hands of the Communists, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] and his [[Viet Minh]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Larkin, ''France since the Popular Front: Government and People 1936–1996'' (1997) pp. 240–1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference in July 1954]] Mendès France made a deal that gave the Viet Minh control of Vietnam north of the seventeenth parallel, and allowed France to pull out all its forces.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Young, ''The 1954 Geneva Conference: Indo-China and Korea'' (Greenwood Press, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; That left South Vietnam standing alone. However, the United States moved in and provided large scale financial military and economic support for South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thomas J.

Algeria was no mere colony.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} With over a million European residents in Algeria (the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]), France refused to grant independence until the [[Algerian War of Independence]] had turned into a French political and civil crisis. Algeria was given its independence in 1962, unleashing a massive wave of immigration from the former colony back to France of both Pied-Noir and Algerians who had supported France.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Evans, ''Algeria: France's Undeclared War'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James McDougall, "The Impossible Republic: The Reconquest of Algeria and the Decolonization of France, 1945–1962," ''The Journal of Modern History'' 89#4 (December 2017) pp. 772–811 [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694427 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Shepard, ''The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suez crisis (1956)===
{{Main|Suez crisis}}
[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the Suez Canal hit during the initial Anglo-French assault on [[Port Said]], 5 November 1956.]]
In 1956, another crisis struck French colonies, this time in Egypt. The Suez Canal, having been built by the French government, belonged to the French Republic and was operated by the [[Suez Canal Company|Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]. Great Britain had bought the Egyptian share from [[Isma'il Pasha]] and was the second-largest owner of the canal before the crisis.

The Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the canal despite French and British opposition; he determined that a European response was unlikely. Great Britain and France attacked Egypt and built an alliance with Israel against Nasser. Israel attacked from the east, Britain from Cyprus and France from Algeria. Egypt, the most powerful Arab state of the time, was defeated in a mere few days. The Suez crisis caused an outcry of indignation in the entire Arab world and Saudi Arabia set an embargo on oil on France and Britain. The US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] forced a ceasefire; Britain and Israel soon withdrew, leaving France alone in Egypt. Under strong international pressures, the French government ultimately evacuated its troops from Suez and largely disengaged from the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Gorst and Lewis Johnman, ''The Suez Crisis'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===President de Gaulle, 1958–1969===
The [[May 1958 crisis|May 1958 seizure of power in Algiers by French army units]] and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face of Arab nationalist insurrection ripped apart the unstable Fourth Republic. The National Assembly brought De Gaulle back to power during the May 1958 crisis. He founded the Fifth Republic with a strengthened presidency, and he was elected in the latter role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs (Frenchmen settled in Algeria) and the military; both had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule. He granted independence to Algeria in 1962 and progressively to other French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Horne, ''A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proclaiming ''grandeur'' essential to the nature of France, de Gaulle initiated his "Politics of Grandeur."&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Kolodziej, ''French International Policy under de Gaulle and Pompidou: The Politics of Grandeur'' (1974) p. 618&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On his presidency, see {{Cite book |last=Fenby |first=Jonathan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKn2xyFGwlcC |title=The General: Charles De Gaulle and the France He Saved |date=2010 |isbn=9781620874479 |pages=380–626}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded complete autonomy for France in world affairs, which meant that major decisions could not be forced upon it by NATO, the European Community or anyone else. De Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence." He vetoed Britain's entry into the Common Market, fearing it might gain too great a voice on French affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=W. W.

France then adopted the [[Mutual assured destruction|dissuasion du faible au fort doctrine]] which meant a Soviet attack on France would only bring total destruction to both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hecht |first=Gabrielle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yl2BbxqFY0C&amp;pg=PR7 |title=The Radiance of France: Nuclear Power and National Identity after World War II |date=2009 |isbn=9780262266178 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He [[Élysée Treaty|restored]] cordial [[Franco-German relations]] in order to create a European counterweight between the "Anglo-Saxon" (American and British) and Soviet spheres of influence. De Gaulle openly criticised the [[Vietnam War|U.S. intervention in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=De Gaulle urges the United States to get out of Vietnam |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/de-gaulle-urges-the-united-states-to-get-out-of-vietnam |access-date=26 July 2015 |website=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was angry at American economic power, especially what his Finance minister called the "[[exorbitant privilege]]" of the U.S. dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Eichengreen |first=Barry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIlpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 |title=Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System |date=2011 |isbn=9780199781485 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Canada and proclaimed "[[Vive le Québec libre]]", the catchphrase for an independent Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wayne C.

In [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], he appeared likely to lose power amidst widespread protests by students and workers, but persisted through the crisis with backing from the army. His party, denouncing radicalism, won the [[1968 French legislative election|1968 election]] with an increased majority in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Seidman, ''The Imaginary Revolution: Parisian Students and Workers in 1968'' (Berghahn, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, de Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a [[1969 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] in which he proposed more decentralization. His ''War Memoirs'' became a classic of modern French literature and many French political parties and figures claim the [[gaullist]] heritage.

===Economic crises: 1970s-1980s===
By the late 1960s, France's economic growth, while strong, was beginning to lose steam. A global currency crisis meant a devaluation of the Franc against the West German Mark and the U.S. Dollar in 1968, which was one of the leading factors for [[May 1968 in France|the social upheaval of that year]]. Industrial policy was used to bolster French industries.&lt;ref&gt;Mairi Maclean, ''Economic Management and French Business: From de Gaulle to Chirac'' (Springer, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' era (1945–1975) ended with the worldwide [[1973 oil crisis]], which increased costs in energy and thus on production. Economic instability marked the [[Giscard d'Estaing]] government (1974-1981). Giscard turned to Prime Minister [[Raymond Barre]] in 1976, who advocated numerous complex, strict policies ("Barre Plans"). The first Barre plan emerged on 22 September 1976, with a priority to stop inflation. It included a three-month price freeze; a reduction in the value added tax; wage controls; salary controls; a reduction of the growth in the money supply; and increases in the income tax, automobile taxes, luxury taxes and bank rates. There were measures to restore the trade balance, and support the growth of the economy and employment. Oil imports, whose price had shot up, were limited. There was special aid to exports, and an action fund was set up to aid industries. There was increased financial aid to farmers, who were suffering from a drought, and for social security. The package was not very popular, but was pursued with vigor.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Frears, ''France in the Giscard Presidency'' (1981) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Hibbs Jr, and Nicholas Vasilatos. "Economics and Politics in France: Economic Performance and Mass Political Support for Presidents Pompidou and Giscard d'Estaing."'' European Journal of Political Research'' 9.2 (1981): 133-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic troubles continued into the early years of the presidency of [[François Mitterrand]]. A recession in the early 1980s, which led to the abandonment of ''dirigisme'' in favour of a more pragmatic approach to economic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Sachs, and Charles Wyplosz, "The economic consequences of President Mitterrand." ''Economic Policy'' 1.2 (1986): 261-306.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth resumed later in the decade, only to be slowed down by the economic depression of the early 1990s, which affected the Socialist Party. Liberalisation under [[Jacques Chirac]] in the late 1990s strengthened the economy. However, after 2005 the world economy stagnated and the 2008 global crisis and its effects in both the Eurozone and France itself dogged the conservative government of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who lost reelection in 2012 against Socialist [[Francois Hollande]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Levy, Alistair Cole, and Patrick Le Galès, "From Chirac to Sarkozy. A New France." ''Developments in French politics'' 4 (2008): 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

France's recent economic history has been less turbulent than in many other countries. The average income in France, after having been steady for a long time, increased elevenfold between 1700 and 1975, which constitutes a 0.9% growth rate per year, a rate which has been outdone almost every year since 1975: By the early Eighties, for instance, wages in France were on or slightly above the [[EEC]] average.&lt;ref&gt;David Card, Francis Kramarz, and Thomas Lemieux, "Changes in the relative structure of wages and employment: A comparison of the United States, Canada, and France" (No. w5487. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1996) [http://www.crest.fr/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Pageperso/kramarz/card-kramarz-lemieux.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989 to early 21st century===
After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the USSR]] and the end of the [[Cold War]] potential menaces to mainland France appeared considerably reduced. France began reducing its nuclear capacities and conscription was abolished in 2001. In 1990 France, led by [[François Mitterrand]], joined the short successful [[Gulf War]] against Iraq; the French participation to this war was called the [[Opération Daguet]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Short, ''A Taste for Intrigue: The Multiple Lives of François Mitterrand'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism grew worse. In 1994 [[Air France Flight 8969]] was hijacked by terrorists; they were captured.

Conservative [[Jacques Chirac]] assumed office as president on 17 May 1995, after a campaign focused on the need to combat France's stubbornly high unemployment rate. While France continues to revere its rich history and independence, French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued development of the European Union. In 1992 France ratified the [[Maastricht Treaty]] establishing the [[European Union]]. In 1999, the Euro was introduced to replace the French franc. Beyond membership in the [[European Union]], France is also involved in many joint European projects such as [[Airbus]], the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]] and the [[Eurocorps]].

The French have stood among the strongest supporters of [[NATO]] and EU policy in the Balkans to prevent genocide in [[Yugoslavia]]. French troops joined the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. France has also been actively involved against international terrorism. In 2002 [[Alliance Base]], an international [[Counterterrorist Intelligence Center]], was secretly established in Paris. The same year France contributed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|toppling of the Taliban regime]] in Afghanistan, but it strongly rejected the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], even threatening to veto the US proposed resolution.
[[File:Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel (Frankfurter Buchmesse 2017).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emmanuel Macron]] and Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] in 2017]]

Jacques Chirac was reelected in 2002, mainly because his socialist rival [[Lionel Jospin]] was removed from the runoff by the right wing candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. Conservative [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected and took office on 16 May 2007. The problem of high unemployment has yet to be resolved.

In [[2012 French presidential election|2012 election for president]], Socialist [[François Hollande]] defeated Sarkozy's try for reelection.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Nadeau and Michael S. Lewis-Beck, "French election theory: Why Sarkozy lost." ''Parliamentary Affairs'' 66.1 (2013): 52–68&lt;/ref&gt; Hollande advocated a growth policy in contrast to the austerity policy advocated by Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] as a way of tackling the [[European sovereign debt crisis]]. In 2014 Hollande stood with Merkel and US President Obama in imposing sanctions on Russia for its actions against Ukraine.

In the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 election for president]] the winner was [[Emmanuel Macron]], the founder of a new party "[[La République En Marche!]]". It declared itself above left and right. He called parliamentary elections that brought him absolute majority of députés. He appointed a prime minister from the centre right, and ministers from both the centre left and centre right.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Hewlett, "The phantom revolution. The presidential and parliamentary elections of 2017," ''Modern &amp; Contemporary France'' (2017) 25#4 pp. 377–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sophie Meunier]] in 2017 ponders whether France is still relevant in world affairs:
:France does not have as much relative global clout as it used to. Decolonization… diminished France's territorial holdings and therefore its influence. Other countries acquired nuclear weapons and built up their armies. The message of "universal" values carried by French foreign policy has encountered much resistance, as other countries have developed following a different political trajectory than the one preached by France. By the 1990s, the country had become, in the words of [[Stanley Hoffmann]], an "ordinary power, neither a basket case nor a challenger." Public opinion, especially in the United States, no longer sees France as an essential power. The last time that its foreign policy put France back in the world spotlight was at the outset of the Iraq intervention…[with] France's refusal to join the US-led coalition….In reality, however, France is still a highly relevant power in world affairs….France is a country of major military importance nowadays…., France also showed it mattered in world environmental affairs with….the Paris Agreement, a global accord to reduce carbon emissions. The election of Trump in 2016 may reinforce demands for France to step in and lead global environmental governance if the US disengages, as the new president has promised, from a variety of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Meunier, "Is France Still Relevant?." ''French Politics, Culture &amp; Society'' 35.2 (2017): 59-75, quoting pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim tensions===
{{Main|2005 civil unrest in France|2009 French riots|Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Charlie Hebdo shooting|November 2015 Paris attacks|2016 Nice truck attack}}
At the close of the Algerian war, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including some who had supported France ([[Harkis]]), settled permanently to France, especially to the larger cities where they lived in subsidized public housing, and suffered very high unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad and Michael J. Balz, "The October Riots in France: A Failed Immigration Policy or the Empire Strikes Back?" ''International Migration'' (2006) 44#2 pp. 23–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, the predominantly Arab-immigrant suburbs of Paris, Lyon, Lille, and other French cities erupted in riots by socially alienated teenagers, many of them second- or third-generation immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=9 November 2005 |title=Special Report: Riots in France |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/4417096.stm |access-date=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Mucchielli, "Autumn 2005: A review of the most important riot in the history of French contemporary society." ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'' (2009) 35#5 pp. 731–751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the next three convulsive weeks, riots spread from suburb to suburb, affecting more than three hundred towns….Nine thousand vehicles were torched, hundreds of public and commercial buildings destroyed, four thousand rioters arrested, and 125 police officers wounded.&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;Cathy Lisa Schneider, "Police Power and Race Riots in Paris," ''Politics &amp; Society'' (2008) 36#1 pp. 133–159 on p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditional interpretations say these race riots were spurred by radical Muslims or unemployed youth. Another view states that the riots reflected a broader problem of racism and police violence in France.&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt;

[[File:Place de la République, 18h50, une foule silencieuse.jpg|thumb|On 11 January 2015, over 1 million demonstrators, plus dozens of foreign leaders, gather at the Place de la Republique to pledge solidarity to liberal French values, after the Charlie Hebdo shooting]]
In March 2012, a Muslim radical named [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Mohammed Merah]] shot three French soldiers and four Jewish citizens, including children in [[Toulouse]] and [[Montauban]].

In January 2015, the satirical newspaper [[Charlie Hebdo]] that had ridiculed the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and a neighborhood Jewish grocery store came under [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|attack]] from angry Muslims who had been born and raised in the Paris region. World leaders rally to Paris to show their support for free speech. Analysts agree that the episode had a profound impact on France. ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized the ongoing debate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So as France grieves, it is also faced with profound questions about its future: How large is the radicalized part of the country's Muslim population, the largest in Europe? How deep is the rift between France's values of secularism, of individual, sexual and religious freedom, of freedom of the press and the freedom to shock, and a growing Muslim conservatism that rejects many of these values in the name of religion?&lt;ref&gt;Steven Erlangerjan, "Days of Sirens, Fear and Blood: 'France Is Turned Upside Down'", [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/10/world/days-of-sirens-fear-and-blood-france-is-turned-upside-down.html ''New York Times'' Jan 9, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{clear left}}
