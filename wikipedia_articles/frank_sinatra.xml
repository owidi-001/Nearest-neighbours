'''Francis Albert Sinatra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|r|ə}}; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor who is generally perceived as one of the greatest musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], having sold an estimated 150 million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/theatre/ol-blue-eyes-frank-sinatra-is-coming-back-to-west-end-in-new-musical-a3262126.html|title=Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra ia coming back to west end in new musical|work=Evening Standard|access-date=June 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pisani|first=Bob|date=2015-12-11|title=The business of Frank Sinatra|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/11/the-business-of-frank-sinatra.html|access-date=2021-06-26|website=CNBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born to Italian immigrants in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], Sinatra was greatly influenced by the intimate easy listening vocal style of [[Bing Crosby]]&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Garry ''Bing Crosby: The Unsung King of Song'', published 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and began his musical career in the [[swing era]] with bandleaders [[Harry James]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]]. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the "[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]". 

Sinatra released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. But by the early 1950s, his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of the film ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently earning him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra then released several critically lauded albums, some of which are retrospectively noted as being among the first "[[concept album]]s", including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958), ''[[No One Cares]]'' (1959), and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).

Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. &amp; Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.

Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (1950 TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the [[FBI]] for his alleged relationship with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].

While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him "the greatest singer of the 20th century",&lt;ref name="Christgau" /&gt; and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}

Sinatra's mother was energetic and driven,{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=6}} and biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in the development of her son's personality traits and self-confidence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Rojek|1y=2004|1p=25|2a1=Santopietro|2y=2008|2p=15}} Sinatra's fourth wife [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara]] would later claim that Dolly was abusive to him when he was a child, and "knocked him around a lot".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=86}} Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] circles.{{sfn|Sann|1967|p=351}} She worked as a [[midwife]], earning $50 for each delivery,{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=8–9}} and according to Sinatra biographer [[Kitty Kelley]], also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls, for which she was nicknamed "Hatpin Dolly".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=28}}{{efn|Dolly was reportedly arrested six or seven times and convicted twice for providing illegal abortions,{{sfnm|1a1=Kuntz|1a2=Kuntz|1y=2000|1p=36|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=16}} the first of which was in 1937.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=29}}}} She also had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=6, 8–9}}

[[File:The Hoboken Four on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra (''far right'') with the [[Hoboken Four]] on ''Major Bowes' Amateur Hour'' in 1935]]
Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager, but he [[Learning music by ear|learned music by ear]] and never learned to read music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/top-ten-things-that-make-frank-sinatra-cool-6614026 | title=Top Ten Things That Make Frank Sinatra Cool | work=Phoenix New Times | date=July 7, 2011 | access-date=September 28, 2015 | author=D'Andrea, Niki}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Young|Young|2007|p=474}} He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group, the [[Hoboken Four|3 Flashes]], to let him join. Fred Tamburro, the group's [[baritone]], stated that "Frank hung around us like we were gods or something", admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car{{efn|Nancy Sinatra notes that he owned a Chrysler and people would show amazement that such a young kid could afford it.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=18}}}} and could chauffeur the group around. Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the ''[[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]]'' show, and "begged" the group to let him in on the act.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=39}} With Sinatra, the group became known as the Hoboken Four, and passed an audition from [[Edward Bowes]] to appear on the ''Major Bowes Amateur Hour'' show. They each earned $12.50 for the appearance,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=25}} and ended up attracting 40,000 votes and won first prize—a six-month contract to perform on stage and radio across the United States.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=40}} Sinatra quickly became the group's lead singer, and, much to the jealousy of his fellow group members, garnered most of the attention from girls.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=42}}{{efn|The jealousy exhibited by the group members often led to brawls in which they would beat up the small, skinny young Sinatra.{{sfn|Quirk|Schoell|1999|pp=19–20}}}} Due to the success of the group, Bowes kept asking for them to return, disguised under different names, varying from "The Secaucus Cockamamies" to "The Bayonne Bacalas".&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;

[[File:Frank Sinatra and Harry James at the Hollywood Canteen, 1943.jpg|thumb|Sinatra performing with [[Harry James]] at the [[Hollywood Canteen]], 1943]]
In 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a [[Roadhouse (facility)#United States|roadhouse]] called "The Rustic Cabin" in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], for which he was paid $15 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Hodge|1y=1992|1p=11|2a1=Rojek|2y=2004|2p=41}} The roadhouse was connected to the [[WBBR|WNEW]] radio station in New York City, and he began performing with a group live during the ''Dance Parade'' show.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=27}} Despite the low salary, Sinatra felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends that he was going to "become so big that no one could ever touch him".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=46}} In March 1939, saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey City radio station WAAT where both performed on live broadcasts, arranged for him to audition and record "[[Our Love (1939 song)|Our Love]]", his first solo studio recording.&lt;ref name=CoyneK /&gt;{{efn| Only one copy of this recording was made, a 78{{nbsp}}rpm disc.

[[File:Frank Sinatra and Tommy Dorsey, 1942 (close-up).jpg|thumb|Sinatra and [[Tommy Dorsey]] in ''[[Ship Ahoy]]'' (1942)]]
Sinatra became increasingly frustrated with the status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend [[Hank Sanicola]] persuaded him to stay with the group,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=54}} but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard{{efn|the vocalist, not to be confused with the comedian [[Jack E. Leonard]].}} as the lead singer of the [[Tommy Dorsey]] band. Sinatra earned $125 a week, appearing at the Palmer House in [[Chicago]],{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=135}} and James released Sinatra from his contract.&lt;ref name=pc1a&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|A |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633217/m1/#track/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Sinatra acknowledged his debt to James throughout his life, and upon hearing of James' death in 1983, stated: "he is the one that made it all possible."{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=24}}}} On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the [[Coronado Theatre]] in [[Rockford, Illinois]],{{sfn|Silva|2000|p=12}} opening the show with "[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]".{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=94}} Dorsey recalled: "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no [[matinée idol]]. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59–60}} Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a [[father figure]]. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter [[Nancy Sinatra|Nancy]] in June 1940.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1pp=59–60|2a1=Lahr|2y=2000|2p=59}} Sinatra later said that "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey".{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=1}} Though Kelley says that Sinatra and drummer [[Buddy Rich]] were bitter rivals,{{efn|Kelley says that arguments and fights regularly broke out between Sinatra and Rich, who were both arrogant with volatile tempers. In one incident witnessed by Stafford backstage at the [[Astor Hotel]] in New York, Rich called Sinatra a name and Sinatra threw a heavy glass pitcher filled with water and ice at Rich's head. In another incident at the [[Golden Gate Theater]] in San Francisco, Rich reportedly attempted to ram Sinatra against the wall with his high F cymbal.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=58–59}}}} other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.{{sfnm|1a1=Shaw|1y=1968|1p=34|2a1=Consiglio|2a2=Douskey|2y=2011|2p=135}}

In his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra recorded over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song "[[Polka Dots and Moonbeams]]" in late April 1940.{{sfn|Whitburn|1986|p=136}} Two more chart appearances followed with "[[Say It (Frank Sinatra song)|Say It]]" and "[[Imagination (1940 song)|Imagination]]", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit.{{sfn|Whitburn|1986|p=136}} His fourth chart appearance was "[[I'll Never Smile Again]]", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July.{{sfnm|1a1=Whitburn|1y=1986|1p=136|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=91}} Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by [[RCA Victor]] include "[[Our Love Affair]]" and "Stardust" in 1940; "[[Oh! Look at Me Now]]", "[[Dolores (song)|Dolores]]", "[[Everything Happens to Me (song)|Everything Happens to Me]]", and "[[This Love of Mine]]" in 1941; "[[Just as Though You Were There]]", "[[Take Me (Frank Sinatra song)|Take Me]]", and "[[There Are Such Things]]" in 1942; and "[[It Started All Over Again]]", "[[In the Blue of Evening]]", and "[[It's Always You]]" in 1943.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=567–568}} As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey to allow him to record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]", "[[The Night We Called It a Day (song)|The Night We Called It a Day]]", "[[The Song is You]]", and "[[Lamplighter's Serenade]]" at a Bluebird recording session, with [[Axel Stordahl]] as arranger and conductor.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Lees|2y=1998|2p=97}} Sinatra first heard the recordings at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] and [[Hollywood Plaza Hotel|Hollywood Plaza]] and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=67}}

After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra believed he needed to go solo,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=67–68}} with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby,{{efn|Sinatra said: "The reason I wanted to leave Tommy's band was that Crosby was Number One, way up on top of the pile. In the open field, you might say, were some awfully good singers with the orchestras. [[Bob Eberly]] (with [[Jimmy Dorsey]]) was a fabulous vocalist. [[Perry Como|Mr. Como]] (with [[Ted Weems]]) is such a wonderful singer. I thought, if I don't make a move out of this and try to do it on my own soon, one of those guys will do it, and I'll have to fight all three of them to get a position".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}}}} but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}}  A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1942.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=70}}{{efn|Sinatra's lawyer, Henry Jaffe, met with Dorsey's lawyer N. Joseph Ross in Los Angeles in August 1943. In the words of Kelley: "In the end, MCA, an agency representing Dorsey and courting Sinatra, made Dorsey a $60,000 offer that he accepted. To obtain Frank as a client, the agency paid Dorsey $35,000 while Sinatra paid $25,000, which he borrowed from Manie Sacks as an advance against his royalties from Columbia Records. MCA agreed that until 1948 it would split its commissions on Sinatra with GAC, the agency that Frank had signed with when he left the Dorsey band."{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=70}} However, during a 1979 concert at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles, Sinatra said that it took him years to escape the contract, and that Dorsey had cost him 7{{nbsp}}million dollars.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=72}}}} On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bade farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, "I hope you fall on your ass",{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}} but he was more gracious on the air when replacing Sinatra with singer [[Dick Haymes]].&lt;ref name=pc1a /&gt; Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, [[Willie Moretti]], coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding a gun to his head.{{sfn|Anastasia|Macnow|Pistone|2011|p=301}}{{efn|The incident started rumors of Sinatra's involvement with the Mafia, and was fictionalized in the book and film ''The Godfather''.{{sfn|Levinson|2009|p=161}}}} Upon leaving Dorsey, Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to come with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times his salary from Dorsey.{{Sfn|Goldstein|1982|p=9}} Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never reconciled their differences.  Up until his death in November 1956, Dorsey occasionally made biting comments about Sinatra to the press such as "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=71}}

Sinatra did not serve in the military during World War II.

=== Columbia years and career slump (1946–1952) ===
[[File:Frank Sinatra Metronome magazine November 1950.JPG|thumb|Sinatra in November 1950]]
Despite being heavily involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years Sinatra sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films. By 1946 he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week.{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=150}}

In 1946 Sinatra released "[[Oh!

William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Sinatra "took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness", and that his "singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-voice-of-frank-sinatra-mw0000659223|title=The Voice of Frank Sinatra|website=AllMusic|access-date=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon selling 10{{nbsp}}million records a year.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=129}} Such was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged with the release of the set ''[[Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder]]'', an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase at the time, which consisted of teenage girls.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=21}} The following year he released his second album, ''[[Songs by Sinatra]]'', featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[How Deep is the Ocean?]]" and [[Harold Arlen]]'s and [[Jerome Kern]]'s "[[All The Things You Are]]".{{sfn|Osborne|2014|p=98}} "[[Mam'selle]]", composed by [[Edmund Goulding]] with lyrics by [[Mack Gordon]] for the film ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1946),{{Sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=236}} was released as a single.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} Sinatra had competition; versions by [[Art Lund]], [[Dick Haymes]], [[Dennis Day]], and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6h8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=Mam%27selle+billboard&amp;pg=PA23|work=Billboard|title=Most Played Juke Box Records|page=23|date=May 31, 1947|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December he recorded "[[Sweet Lorraine]]" with the [[Metronome All-Stars]], featuring talented jazz musicians such as [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Harry Carney]] and [[Charlie Shavers]], with [[Nat King Cole]] on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as "one of the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}}
[[File:Sinatra Radio.gif|right|thumb|Sinatra and [[Alida Valli]]]]
Sinatra's third album, ''[[Christmas Songs by Sinatra]]'', was originally released in 1948 as a 78{{nbsp}}rpm album set,{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=47–48}} and a 10" LP record was released two years later.{{sfn|Larkin|2002|p=397}} When Sinatra was featured as a priest in ''[[The Miracle of the Bells]]'', due to press negativity surrounding his alleged Mafia connections at the time,{{efn|Sinatra was spotted in Havana in 1946 with mobster [[Lucky Luciano]], which started a series of negative press articles, implicating Sinatra with the Mafia.{{sfn|Hanna|1998|p=21}} In 1947 he was involved in a violent incident with journalist [[Lee Mortimer]], who had written some of the most scathing articles on his alleged connections. Kelley says that his articles grew so offensive that Sinatra pounced on him outside Ciro's and punched him behind the left ear in response to an insult in which he was called a "dago". Sinatra was taken to court, and according to Kelley, Mortimer received Mafia threats to drop the case or lose his life.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=139–141}}}} it was announced to the public that Sinatra would donate his $100,000 in wages from the film to the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Hanna|1998|p=21}} By the end of 1948, Sinatra had slipped to fourth on ''DownBeat''{{'}}s annual poll of most popular singers (behind [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Frankie Laine]], and Bing Crosby).{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=149}} and in the following year he was pushed out of the top spots in polls for the first time since 1943.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=158}} ''[[Frankly Sentimental]]'' (1949) was panned by ''DownBeat'', who commented that "for all his talent, it seldom comes to life".{{Sfn|Shaw|1968|p=131}}

Though "[[The Hucklebuck]]" reached the top ten,{{Sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=301}} it was his last single release under the Columbia label.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} Sinatra's last two albums with Columbia, ''[[Dedicated to You (Frank Sinatra album)|Dedicated to You]]'' and ''[[Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra]]'', were released in 1950.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=218}} Sinatra would later feature a number of the ''Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra'' album's songs, including "[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]", "[[It's Only a Paper Moon (song)|It's Only a Paper Moon]]", "[[It All Depends on You]]", on his 1961 Capitol release, ''[[Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!]]''.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=67}}

Cementing the low of his career was the death of publicist George Evans from a heart attack in January 1950 at 48. According to [[Jimmy Van Heusen]], Sinatra's close friend and songwriter, Evans's death to him was "an enormous shock which defies words", as he had been crucial to his career and popularity with the bobbysoxers.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=161}} Sinatra's reputation continued to decline as reports broke out in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction of his marriage to Nancy,{{sfn|Small|2009|p=59}} though he insisted that his marriage had long been over even before he had met Gardner.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=162}} In April, Sinatra was engaged to perform at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copa]] club in New York, but had to cancel five days of the booking due to suffering a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=168–169}} Evans once said that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss of voice it was always due to emotional tension which "absolutely destroyed him".{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}}

In financial difficulty following his divorce and career decline, Sinatra was forced to borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes after MCA refused to front the money.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=172}} Rejected by Hollywood, he turned to [[Las Vegas]] and made his debut at the [[Desert Inn]] in September 1951,{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=48}} and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in [[Reno, Nevada]].

Rojek notes that the [[Rat Pack]] "provided an outlet for gregarious banter and wisecracks", but argues that it was Sinatra's vehicle, possessing an "unassailable command over the other performers".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=136}} Sinatra would fly to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen's single-engine plane.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=97}} On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]], after an invitation by the manager [[Jack Entratter]],{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=189}} who had previously worked at the Copa in New York.{{sfn|Ainlay|Gabaldon|2003|p=108}} Sinatra typically performed there three times a year, and later acquired a share in the hotel.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=243|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2011|2p=656}}{{efn|Sinatra bought a two percent share in the hotel for $54,000.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=656}} At one point the share reached nine percent.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=245}} He was reportedly ordered to sell his interest in the Sands in 1963, due to his association with mobster [[Sam Giancana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2881720/sinatra_drives_golf_cart_through_sands/|title=Sinatra Hit in Mouth in Vegas Melee|work=The Times ([[San Mateo, California]])|date=September 12, 1967|page=8|access-date=July 29, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sinatra's decline in popularity was evident at his concert appearances. At a brief run at the Paramount in New York he drew small audiences.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=164}} At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters and ranchers.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=529}} At a concert at [[Chez Paree]] in Chicago, only 150 people in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=529}} By April 1952 he was performing at the [[Kauai County Fair]] in Hawaii.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=93}} Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] executive [[Mitch Miller]] claiming he "couldn't give away" the singer's records.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=164}}{{efn|Miller tried to offset Sinatra's declining record sales by introducing "gimmicky novel tunes" into the singer's repertoire such as "Mama Will Bark" to appeal to younger audiences.&lt;ref name="columbia-yrs-hemming-36"&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Best of the Columbia Years: 1943–1952 |title-link=The Best of the Columbia Years: 1943–1952 |year=1995 |chapter=Sinatra Standards |first=Hemming |last=Roy |page=36 |type=booklet |publisher=SONY Music Entertainment |id=C4K 64681 |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=476–477}} "Mama Will Bark" is often cited as the worst of Sinatra's career.

=== Career revival and the Capitol years (1953–1962) ===
[[File:Nelson Riddle 1958.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Nelson Riddle]], Sinatra's album arranger for Capitol Records]]
The release of the film ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career revival.{{sfn|Kidder|Oppenheim|2008|p=157}} [[Tom Santopietro]] notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his work, with an "unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and concerts",{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=187}} in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe as "a new and brilliant phase".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=188}} On March 13, 1953, Sinatra met with Capitol Records vice president [[Alan Livingston]] and signed a seven-year recording contract.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=601}} His first session for Capitol took place at KHJ studios at Studio C, 5515 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, with Axel Stordahl conducting.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=604, 615}} The session produced four recordings, including "[[I'm Walking Behind You]]",{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=604}} Sinatra's first Capitol single.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=101}} After spending two weeks on location in Hawaii filming ''From Here to Eternity'', Sinatra returned to KHJ on April 30 for his first recording session with [[Nelson Riddle]], an established arranger and conductor at Capitol who was Nat King Cole's musical director.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=614–615, 618}} After recording the first song, "[[I've Got the World on a String]]", Sinatra offered Riddle a rare expression of praise, "Beautiful!",{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=616}} and after listening to the playbacks, he could not hide his enthusiasm, exclaiming, "I'm back, baby, I'm back!"{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}}

In subsequent sessions in May and November 1953,{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=33}} Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}} Sinatra's first album for Capitol, ''[[Songs for Young Lovers]]'', was released on January 4, 1954, and included "[[A Foggy Day]]", "[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]", "[[My Funny Valentine]]", "[[Violets for Your Furs]]" and "[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]",{{sfnm|1a1=Kline|1y=1990|1p=18|2a1=Granata|2y=2003|2p=91}} songs which became staples of his later concerts.&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC57" /&gt; That same month, Sinatra released the single "[[Young at Heart (Frank Sinatra song)|Young at Heart]]", which reached No. 2 and was awarded Song of the Year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=O'Brien|2y=2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinatrafamily.com/single/young-at-heart-125/|title=Young at Heart|publisher=Sinatra Discography|access-date=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/young-at-heart-mw0000867619/awards|title=Young at Heart album awards|website=AllMusic|access-date=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Sinatra was not very enthusiastic about the song initially. His friend, Jimmy Van Heusen, convinced him that the song would be a success.{{sfn|O'Brien|2014}} ''Young at Heart'' was produced by Day's husband at the time, [[Marty Melcher]], whom Sinatra detested. Their feud grew worse when Melcher suggested that Day sing "Young at Heart" as the film's title song when Sinatra's recording of the song was already a hit. Day conceded that she did not care whose voice was heard singing the film's title song. Because of the rift, the ''Young at Heart'' soundtrack album contains all the songs heard in the film but the title ''Young at Heart''. Sinatra's hit recording is heard at the beginning and end of the film.{{sfn|Bret|2014|p=63}}}} In March, he recorded and released the single "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]", a "powerful ballad"&lt;ref name="Inc.1954"&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=The Billboard Music Popularity Charts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YB8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=May 8, 1954|page=22|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; that reached No. 4.{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=19}} Sinatra's second album with Riddle, ''[[Swing Easy!]]'', which reflected his "love for the jazz idiom" according to Granata,{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=91}} was released on August 2 of that year and included "[[Just One of Those Things (song)|Just One of Those Things]]", "[[Taking a Chance on Love]]", "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]", and "[[All of Me (Ruth Etting song)|All of Me]]".{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=19}}&lt;ref name="Inc.1965"&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=The Sinatra Discography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MykEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT117|date=November 20, 1965|page=117|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Swing Easy!'' was named Album of the Year by ''Billboard'', and he was also named "Favorite Male Vocalist" by ''Billboard'', ''DownBeat'', and ''[[Metronome]]'' that year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=Evanier|2y=2011|2p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Artists Favorites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|date=November 13, 1954|page=42|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra came to consider Riddle "the greatest arranger in the world",{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=192}} and Riddle, who considered Sinatra "a perfectionist",{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}} offered equal praise of the singer, observing, "It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable{{nbsp}}... there is still no one who can approach him."{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=192}}

In 1955 Sinatra released ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'', his first 12" LP,{{Sfn|Smith|2009|p=18}}  featuring songs such as "[[In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning]]", "[[Mood Indigo]]", "[[Glad to Be Unhappy]]" and "[[When Your Lover Has Gone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-wee-small-hours-mw0000650776|title=In the Wee Small Hours|website=AllMusic|access-date=October 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204131932/http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-wee-small-hours-mw0000650776|archive-date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Granata it was the first [[concept album]] of his to make a "single persuasive statement", with an extended program and "melancholy mood".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=91}} Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=302}} Another collaboration with Riddle resulted in the development of ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'', sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956.{{Sfn|Weatherford|2001|p=14}} It features a recording of "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]" by [[Cole Porter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_i5f3jhD9UC|title=The New York Times Guide to the Arts of the 20th Century: 1900–1929 – A New Family and A New Fame|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|page=3072|isbn=978-1-57958-290-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which Sinatra paid meticulous care to, taking a reported 22 takes to perfect.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=102}}

His February 1956 recording sessions inaugurated the studios at the [[Capitol Records Building]],{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=22}} complete with a 56-piece symphonic orchestra.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=117}} According to Granata his recordings of "Night and Day", "Oh! Look at Me Now" and "[[From This Moment On (Cole Porter song)|From This Moment On]]" revealed "powerful sexual overtones, stunningly achieved through the mounting tension and release of Sinatra's best-teasing vocal lines", while his recording of "River, Stay 'Way from My Door" in April demonstrated his "brilliance as a syncopational improviser".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=98}} Riddle said that Sinatra took "particular delight" in singing "The Lady is a Tramp", commenting that he "always sang that song with a certain amount of salaciousness", making "cue tricks" with the lyrics.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=236}} His penchant for conducting was displayed again in 1956's ''[[Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color]]'', an instrumental album that has been interpreted to be a catharsis to his failed relationship with Gardner.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|pp=21–22}} Also that year, Sinatra sang at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], and performed with [[The Dorsey Brothers]] for a week soon afterwards at the Paramount Theatre.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=95}}

In 1957, Sinatra released ''[[Close to You (Frank Sinatra album)|Close to You]]'', ''[[A Swingin' Affair!]]'' and ''[[Where Are You? (Frank Sinatra album)|Where Are You?]]''—his first album in stereo, with [[Gordon Jenkins]].{{sfn|Morrell|2013|p=40}} Granata considers "Close to You" to have been thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the "golden" era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was "extremely progressive" by the standards of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs "[[With Every Breath I Take]]", "[[Blame It on My Youth]]" and  "[[It Could Happen to You (song)|It Could Happen to You]]".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=121}} For Granata, Sinatra's ''A Swingin' Affair!'' and swing music predecessor ''Songs for Swingin' Lovers!'' solidified "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". [[Buddy Collette]] considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], and stated that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=102}} On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the [[McCaw Hall|Seattle Civic Auditorium]],{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=138}} his first appearance in [[Seattle]] since 1945.&lt;ref name="SC57"&gt;''Sinatra '57 in Concert'' (1999), [[Artanis Entertainment Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; The recording was first released as a bootleg, but in 1999 [[Artanis Entertainment Group]] officially released it as the ''[[Sinatra '57 in Concert]]'' live album, after Sinatra's death.&lt;ref name="LAT99"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilburn, Robert|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/11/entertainment/ca-45246|title=Getting a Kick Out of Sinatra, Live in Concert in 1957|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 1999|access-date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Sinatra released the concept album ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' with [[Billy May]], designed as a musical world tour.{{Sfnm|1a1=Mirtle|1y=1998|1pp=154–155|2a1=Turner|2y=2004|2p=107}} It reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks,{{sfn|Whitburn|2001|p=797}} and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] at the [[1st Grammy Awards|inaugural Grammy Awards]].{{Sfn|Mirtle|1998|p=155}} The title song, "[[Come Fly with Me (1957 song)|Come Fly With Me]]", written especially for him, would become one of his best known standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Theatre Record, Volume 7, Issues 14–26 – Sammy Cahn Words And Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uClaAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=I.

In 1959, Sinatra released ''[[Come Dance with Me!

In the words of Kelley, by 1959, Sinatra was "not simply the leader of the Rat Pack" but had "assumed the position of ''il padrone'' in Hollywood". He was asked by 20th Century Fox to be the master of ceremonies at a luncheon attended by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on September 19, 1959.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=287–288}} ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'', a collection of ballads, topped the  ''Billboard'' chart in October 1960 and remained in the charts for 86 weeks, {{Sfn|Fuchs|Prigozy|2007|p=101}} winning critical plaudits.{{Sfn|Campbell|2008|p=220}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Cap Captures Honors at Disc Jockey Poll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|date=December 19, 1960|page=2|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granata noted the "lifelike ambient sound" quality of ''Nice and Easy'', the perfection in the stereo balance, and the "bold, bright and snappy" sound of the band.

=== Reprise years (1961–1981) ===

Sinatra grew discontented at Capitol, and fell into a feud with [[Alan Livingston]], which lasted over six months.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=146}} His first attempt at owning his own label was with his pursuit of buying declining jazz label, [[Verve Records]], which ended once an initial agreement with Verve founder, [[Norman Granz]], "failed to materialize."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/reprise-records-history/|title=To Play and Play Again: How Frank Sinatra's Thirst for Creative Freedom Led to Some of Classic Rock's Greatest Records|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to form his own label, [[Reprise Records]]{{Sfnm|1a1=Friedwald|1y=1995|1p=367|2a1=Rojek|2y=2004|2p=142}} and, in an effort to assert his new direction, temporarily parted with Riddle, May and Jenkins, working with other arrangers such as [[Neil Hefti]], [[Don Costa]], and [[Quincy Jones]].{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=153}}  Sinatra built the appeal of Reprise Records as one in which artists were promised creative control over their music, as well as a guarantee that they would eventually gain "complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/article/label-retrospective-sinatra-forms-reprise-records-on-this-day-in-1960|title=Label Retrospective: Sinatra forms Reprise Records on this day in 1960 {{!}} Rhino|website=www.rhino.com|language=en|access-date=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Sinatra the company developed into a music industry "powerhouse", and he later sold it for an estimated $80{{nbsp}}million.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=340}} His first album on the label, ''[[Ring-a-Ding-Ding!]]'' (1961), was a major success, peaking at No.4 on ''Billboard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=Cliff Richard a Four-Time Winner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jiAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|date=December 11, 1961|first=Espen|last=Eriksen|page=26|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released in February 1961, the same month that Reprise Records released [[Ben Webster]]'s ''[[The Warm Moods]]'', [[Sammy Davis Jr.]]'s ''The Wham of Sam'', [[Mavis Chloe Rivers|Mavis River]]'s ''Mavis'' and [[Joe E.

In 1962, Sinatra released ''[[Sinatra and Strings]]'', a set of standard ballads arranged by Don Costa, which became one of the most critically acclaimed works of Sinatra's entire Reprise period. Frank Jr., who was present during the recording, noted the "huge orchestra", which Nancy Sinatra stated "opened a whole new era" in pop music, with orchestras getting bigger, embracing a "lush string sound".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=162}} Sinatra and [[Count Basie]] collaborated for the album ''[[Sinatra–Basie: An Historic Musical First|Sinatra-Basie]]'' the same year,{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=25}} a popular and successful release which prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'', arranged by Quincy Jones.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=372|2a1=Granata|2y=2003|2p=169}}  The two became frequent performers together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Billboard|title=The Sinatra Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MykEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|date=November 20, 1965|page=36|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1965.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=302}} Also in 1962, as the owner of his own record label, Sinatra was able to step on the podium as conductor again, releasing his third instrumental album ''[[Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays]]''.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=22}}

In 1963, Sinatra reunited with Nelson Riddle for ''[[The Concert Sinatra]]'', an ambitious album featuring a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle.

=== Later career (1982–1998) ===
[[File:Fremont street 1983.jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra signed a $16{{nbsp}}million three-year deal with the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas]] in 1982]]
Santopietro stated that by the early 1980s, Sinatra's voice had "coarsened, losing much of its power and flexibility, but audiences didn't care".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=431}} In 1982, he signed a $16{{nbsp}}million three-year deal with the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]] of Las Vegas. Kelley notes that by this period Sinatra's voice had grown "darker, tougher and loamier", but he "continued to captivate audiences with his immutable magic". She added that his baritone voice "sometimes cracked, but the gliding intonations still aroused the same raptures of delight as they had at the Paramount Theater".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=540}} That year he made a reported further $1.3{{nbsp}}million from the Showtime television rights to his "Concert of the Americas" in the Dominican Republic, $1.6{{nbsp}}million for a concert series at [[Carnegie Hall]], and $250,000 in just one evening at the Chicago Fest. He donated a lot of his earnings to charity.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=542}} He put on a performance at the White House for the Italian prime minister, and performed at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] with [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[George Shearing]].{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=311}}

Sinatra was selected as one of the five recipients of the 1983 [[Kennedy Center Honors]], alongside [[Katherine Dunham]], [[James Stewart]], [[Elia Kazan]], and [[Virgil Thomson]]. Quoting [[Henry James]], President Reagan said in honoring his old friend that "art was the shadow of humanity" and that Sinatra had "spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=544}} On September 21, 1983, Sinatra filed a $2{{nbsp}}million court case against [[Kitty Kelley]], suing her for punitive damages, before her unofficial biography, ''His Way'', was even published. The book became a best-seller for "all the wrong reasons" and "the most eye-opening [[celebrity biographer|celebrity biography]] of our time", according to [[William Safire]] of ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=ESSAY&gt;{{cite news|author=Safire, William|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/29/opinion/essay-the-truth-about-frank.html|title=Essay: The Truth About Frank|work=The New York Times|date=September 19, 1986|access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra was always adamant that such a book would be written on his terms, and he himself would "set the record straight" in details of his life.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Author's note xvii}} According to Kelley, the family detested her and the book, which took its toll on Sinatra's health. Kelley says that Tina Sinatra blamed her for her father's colon surgery in 1986.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Introduction xv}} He was forced to drop the case on September 19, 1984, with several leading newspapers expressing concerns about his views on censorship.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Author's note xviii}}

In 1984, Sinatra worked with Quincy Jones for the first time in nearly two decades on the album, ''[[L.A. Is My Lady]]'', which was well received critically.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=188}} The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with [[Lena Horne]], which had to be abandoned.{{efn|Horne developed vocal problems and Sinatra, committed to other engagements, could not wait to record.{{sfn|Gavin|2009|p=444}}}} In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in [[Atlantic City]] and was hospitalized for [[diverticulitis]],{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=55}} which left him looking frail.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=442}} Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played many large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=444}}

On June 6, 1988, Sinatra made his last recordings with Reprise for an album which was not released. He recorded "[[My Foolish Heart (song)|My Foolish Heart]]", "[[Cry Me A River (1953 song)|Cry Me A River]]", and other songs. Sinatra never completed the project, but take number 18 of "My Foolish Heart" may be heard in ''[[The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newzbreaker.com/2016/08/30/foolish-heart-the-lost-albums-of-frank-sinatra/|title=Foolish Heart: The Lost Albums of Frank Sinatra &amp;#124; Newz Breaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Sinatra was awarded the second "Ella Award" by the Los Angeles-based [[Society of Singers]], and performed for a final time with Ella Fitzgerald at the award ceremony.{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=159}} Sinatra maintained an active touring schedule in the early 1990s, performing 65 concerts in 1990, 73 in 1991 and 84 in 1992 in seventeen different countries.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=448}}

In 1993, Sinatra returned to Capitol Records and the recording studio for ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]'', which became his best-selling album.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=451}} The album and its sequel, ''[[Duets II (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets II]]'', released the following year,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=452}} would see Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a pre-recorded tape.{{sfn|Cole|Browning|Schroeder|2003|p=28}}
During his tours in the early 1990s, his memory failed him at times during concerts, and he fainted onstage in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in March 1994.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=445}} His final public concerts were held in [[Fukuoka Dome]] in Japan on December 19–20, 1994.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=196}} The following year, Sinatra sang for the last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament.{{sfnm|1a1=Santopietro|1y=2008|1p=452|2a1=Sinatra|2y=2011|2p=274}} ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' reported of the show that Sinatra was "clear, tough, on the money" and "in absolute control".{{sfn|Ingham|2005|p=104}} Sinatra was awarded the [[Grammy Legend Award|Legend Award]] at the [[1994 Grammy Awards]], where he was introduced by [[Bono]], who said of him, "Frank's the chairman of the bad attitude{{nbsp}}...

While Sinatra never learned how to read music well, he had a fine, natural understanding of it,{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=31}} He could follow a lead sheet during a performance by "carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semitonal differences.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=38}} Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a "sixth sense", which "demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=30}} Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music,{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=21}} and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as [[Puccini]] and [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]] masters. His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a "certain feeling" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}
By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: "Air for Oboe", "Air for English Horn", "Air for Flute", "Air for Bassoon", "Slow Dance" and "Theme and Variations".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard "a couple of little strangers" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra &amp; Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102–103}}

Voice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was "the best singer in the business".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had "perfected the art of intimacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Frank Sinatra Reader|last = White|first = John|year = 1996|journal = Journal of American Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a "fairly rangy voice",{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low E at 0:41 in the recording of "[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was barely detectable, with his diction becoming "precise" and articulation "meticulous".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would "take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars". Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95–96}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59–60}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="He'd always been critical of his voice, and that only intensified as he got older. He never liked to discuss a performance afterward because he knew his voice wasn't as good as it used to be. If someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible."|source=—Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}
Arrangers such as Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a perfectionist who constantly drove himself and others around him, stating that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14–16}}

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a "rhythm" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28–29}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as "Isn't that a pretty ballad" or "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with "childlike delight".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers. Years ago, his voice was more even, and now it is divided into at least three interesting ranges: low, middle, and high. [He's] probing more deeply into his songs than he used to. That may be due to the ten years he's put on, and the things he's been through."|source=—Nelson Riddle noting the development of Sinatra's voice in 1955.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=137}}}}
Sinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a "brooding melancholy", such as "[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]", "[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]", "[[My One and Only Love]]" and "[[There Will Never Be Another You]]",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii–xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an "ultra-sensitive" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111–112}}

In the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. Up to sixteen songs could now be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69–70}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, "Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}

Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s.

=== Later career (1960–1980) ===
[[File:Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome (alt).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sinatra as Tony Rome]]
Due to an obligation he owed to [[20th Century Fox]] for walking off the set of [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]'s ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' (1956),{{efn|Sinatra had stormed off the set when he learned that the film was to be shot in both Cinemascope and a new 55-millimeter process. Refusing to make "two pictures for the price of one", he left the production and did not return. Fox initially sued Sinatra for a million dollars for breach of contract and replaced him with [[Gordon MacRae]]. Fox agreed to drop the claim on condition that he appear in another picture of theirs.{{sfn|Hickey|2015|p=76}}}} Sinatra starred opposite [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Louis Jourdan]] in ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]'' (1960). He earned $200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=273}} Around the same time, he starred in the Las Vegas-set ''[[Ocean's 11]]'' (also 1960), the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a "new era of screen cool" for Santopietro.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=285}} Sinatra personally financed the film, and paid Martin and Davis fees of $150,000 and $125,000 respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=144}} He had a leading role opposite [[Laurence Harvey]] in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=336|2a1=Santopietro|2y=2008|2p=295}} [[Vincent Canby]], writing for the magazine ''Variety'', found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be "a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/the-manchurian-candidate-1200420234/ | title=Review: 'The Manchurian Candidate' | work=Variety | date=October 17, 1962 | access-date=October 30, 2015 | author=Canby, Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' (also 1962), following it with ''[[4 for Texas]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=144}} For his performance in ''[[Come Blow Your Horn (film)|Come Blow Your Horn]]'' (also 1963) adapted from the [[Neil Simon]] play, he was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor{{nbsp}}– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.&lt;ref name=GoldenGlobes /&gt;

On one occasion, he gave Sinatra [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1962) to read, with the idea of making a film, but Sinatra thought it had no potential and did not understand a word.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=392}}{{efn|The [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] was later made by [[Stanley Kubrick]] in 1971 and is now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/movies100.pdf|title=American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest Movies|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics |title=Sight &amp; Sound&amp;nbsp;– Critics' Top 250 Films |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=October 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026034922/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics |archive-date=October 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sinatra starred opposite [[George Kennedy]] in the western ''[[Dirty Dingus Magee]]'' (1970), an "abysmal" affair according to Santopietro,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=409}} which was panned by the critics.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=414}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ebert, Roger|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/dirty-dingus-magee-1970|title=Dirty Dingus Magee|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=November 23, 1970|access-date=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Sinatra received a [[Golden Globe Cecil B.

Hutton]]'s ''[[The First Deadly Sin]]'' (1980). Santopietro said that as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an "extraordinarily rich", heavily layered characterization, one which "made for one terrific farewell" to his film career.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=648}}

== Television and radio career ==
[[File:Frank Sinatra (1944 CBS Radio publicity photo).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sinatra on CBS Radio in 1944]]
After beginning on the ''[[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]]'' radio show with the Hoboken Four in 1935, and later WNEW and WAAT in Jersey City,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=27}} Sinatra became the star of radio shows of his own on [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. In 1942, Sinatra hired arranger Axel Stordahl away from Tommy Dorsey before he began his first radio program that year, keeping Stordahl with him for all of his radio work.{{sfn|Dunning|1998|pp=260–261}} By the end of 1942, he was named the "Most Popular Male Vocalist on Radio" in a ''DownBeat'' poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3406256/sinatra_most_popular_vocalist_on_radio/|title=Sinatra Most Popular Vocalist on Radio |work=Harrisburg Telegraph ([[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]])|date=January 16, 1943|page=45|access-date=October 12, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on he frequently worked with [[The Andrews Sisters]] on radio, and they would appear as guests on each other's shows,{{sfn|Nimmo|2004|p=228}} as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops via the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] (AFRS).{{sfn|Sforza|2015|p=80}} He appeared as a special guest in the sisters' ABC ''Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch'' series,{{sfn|Nimmo|2004|p=444}} while the trio in turn guested on his ''[[Songs by Sinatra]]'' series on CBS.{{sfn|Sforza|2015|p=99}} Sinatra had two stints as a regular member of cast of ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'';{{efn| ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'' was a popular weekly radio and television program from 1935 to 1958.

In October 1951, the second season of ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (CBS TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[CBS Television]]. Ultimately, Sinatra did not find the success on television for which he had hoped.{{efn|Producer [[Irving Mansfield]] described Sinatra as being obsessed with the thought that his wife, Ava Gardner, was having an affair with her former husband, Artie Shaw. He often started shouting about this on the set of the television show when he phoned his home and could not reach Gardner. Mansfield had to communicate with Sinatra through the entourage that always accompanied him to CBS. Sinatra was always late to work and did not care to spend any time at rehearsal; he blamed all those connected with the program for the poor ratings it received. Mansfield was at his wits' end with Sinatra and his television show and quit the program. Mansfield informed him that he was man of great talent but a failure as a person, which led to Sinatra attempting to angrily fire him. Mansfield replied that he was too late, as he had resigned that morning.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|pp=284–285}}}} Santopietro writes that Sinatra "simply never appeared fully at ease on his own television series, his edgy, impatient personality conveying a pent up energy on the verge of exploding".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=113}} In 1953, Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program ''[[Rocky Fortune]]'', portraying Rocco Fortunato (a.k.a. Rocky Fortune), a "footloose and fancy free" temporary worker for the Gridley Employment Agency who stumbles into crime-solving. The series aired on NBC radio Tuesday nights from October 1953 to March 1954.{{Sfn|Terrace|1998|p=287}}
[[File:Dean Martin Show 1958 Dean Martin Frank Sinatra.JPG|thumb|Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' in 1958]]
In 1957, Sinatra formed a three-year $3{{nbsp}}million contract with ABC to launch ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'', featuring himself and guests in 36 half-hour shows. ABC agreed to allow Sinatra's Hobart Productions to keep 60% of the residuals, and bought stock in Sinatra's film production unit, Kent Productions, guaranteeing him $7{{nbsp}}million.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=278}} Though an initial critical success upon its debut on October 18, 1957, it soon attracted negative reviews from ''Variety'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' thought that Sinatra and frequent guest Dean Martin "performed like a pair of adult delinquents", "sharing the same cigarette and leering at girls".{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=280}} In return, Sinatra later made numerous appearances on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and Martin's TV specials.{{Sfn|Terrace|2013|p=123}}

Sinatra's fourth and final [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] TV special, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|Welcome Home Elvis]]'', was broadcast in March 1960, earning massive viewing figures. During the show, he performed a duet with Presley, who sang Sinatra's 1957 hit "[[Witchcraft (1957 song)|Witchcraft]]" with the host performing the 1956 Presley classic "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]". Sinatra had previously been highly critical of [[Elvis Presley]] and rock and roll in the 1950s, describing it as a "deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac" which "fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people."{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=283}}{{efn|Presley had responded to the criticism: "...{{nbsp}}[Sinatra] is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it{{nbsp}}...

According his musical collaboration with Jobim and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] in 1967, Sinatra appeared in the TV special, ''[[A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim]]'', which was broadcast on CBS on November 13.{{sfn|Terrace|2013|p=157}} When Sinatra came out of retirement in 1973, he released both an album and appeared in a TV special named ''Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back''. The TV special was highlighted by a dramatic reading of "[[Send in the Clowns]]" and a song-and-dance sequence with former co-star Gene Kelly.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=167}} In the late 1970s, John Denver appeared as a guest in the ''Sinatra and Friends'' ABC-TV Special, singing "September Song" as a duet.{{Sfn|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=286}}

Sinatra starred as a detective in ''[[Contract on Cherry Street]]'' (1977), cited as his "one starring role in a dramatic television film".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=430}} Ten years later, he made a guest appearance opposite [[Tom Selleck]] in ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', playing a retired policeman who teams up with Selleck to find his granddaughter's murderer.

Sinatra had met Barbato in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]] in the summer of 1934,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=37}} while working as a [[lifeguard]].{{sfn|Hazard|2007|p=99}} He agreed to marry her after an incident at "The Rustic Cabin" which led to his arrest.{{efn|While working at "The Rustic Cabin" in 1939 he became involved in a dispute between his girlfriend, Toni Della Penta, who suffered a miscarriage, and Nancy Barbato, a stonemason's daughter. After Della Penta attempted to tear off Barbato's dress, Sinatra ordered Barbato away and told Della Pinta that he would marry Barbato, several years his junior, because she was pregnant. Della Penta went to the police, and Sinatra was arrested on a morals charge for seduction. After a fight between Della Penta and Dolly, Della Penta was later arrested herself.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2011}} Sinatra married Barbato that year,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=15}} and Nancy Sinatra was born the following year.{{sfn|Goldstein|1982|p=8}}}} Sinatra had numerous extramarital affairs,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=62–64}} and gossip magazines published details of affairs with women including [[Marilyn Maxwell]], [[Lana Turner]], and [[Joi Lansing]].{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=127}}{{efn|Turner later said the statements were not true in her 1992 autobiography, saying, "The closest things to dates Frank and I enjoyed were a few box lunches at MGM".{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=157}}}}

Well, I was constantly showered with gifts, but no matter what temptations Frank may have had while I wasn't around, he made me feel so safe and loved that I never became paranoid about losing him."|source=—Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's popularity with women.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=219}}}}

Sinatra was married to Hollywood actress [[Ava Gardner]] from 1951 to 1957. It was a turbulent marriage with many well-publicized fights and altercations.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=202}} The couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953, through MGM.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=229}} Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was dating matador [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]],{{sfn|Wayne|2004|p=15}} but the divorce was not settled until 1957.{{sfn|Sonneborn|2002|p=79}} Sinatra continued to feel very strongly for her,{{sfn|Sonneborn|2002|p=79}} and they remained friends for life.{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=221}} He was still dealing with her finances in 1976.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=486}}

=== Style and personality ===
[[File:Frank Sinatra in 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|{{center|Sinatra in 1955}}]]
Sinatra was known for his immaculate sense of style.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=131}} He spent lavishly on expensive custom-tailored tuxedos and stylish pin-striped suits, which made him feel wealthy and important, and that he was giving his very best to the audience.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=51}} He was also obsessed with cleanliness—while with the Tommy Dorsey band he developed the nickname "Lady Macbeth", because of frequent showering and switching his outfits.{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=116}} His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes".{{sfn|Sirvaitis|2010|p=23}}

For Santopietro, Sinatra was the personification of America in the 1950s: "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full of the sense of possibility".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=231}} Barbara Sinatra wrote, "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=3}}  [[Cary Grant]], a friend of Sinatra, stated that Sinatra was the "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=224}}  Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive were "enormous".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}} A workaholic, he reportedly only slept four hours a night on average.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=16}} Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]],{{sfn|Sinatra|Coplon|2000|p=47}} stating to an interviewer in the 1950s that "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=218}} Barbara Sinatra stated that he would "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor",{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=148}} while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was "best to disappear".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=155}}

Sinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists, and photographers.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249–250}} According to Rojek he was "capable of deeply offensive behavior that smacked of a persecution complex".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}} He received negative press for fights with [[Lee Mortimer]] in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in [[Houston]] in 1950, Judy Garland's publicist [[Jim Byron]] on the [[Sunset Strip]] in 1954,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249–250}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3405214/sinatra_vs_jim_byron/|title=Sinatra, Press Agent Trade Blows, Few of Which Connect|work=Oneonta Star ([[Oneonta, New York]])|date=December 10, 1954|page=1|access-date=October 12, 2015| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a confrontation with ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist [[Maxine Cheshire]] in 1973, in which he implied that she was a cheap prostitute.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}{{efn|Rojek states that Sinatra verbally assaulted Cheshire at a party in 1973, remarking, "Get away from me, you scum. Go home and take a bath{{nbsp}}... You're nothing but a two-dollar cunt. You know what that means, don't you? You've been laying down for two dollars all your life". According to Rojek, Sinatra then proceeded to place two-dollar bills in her wine glass and remarked, "Here's two dollars, baby, that's what you're used to".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}}}

His feud with then-''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' columnist [[Mike Royko]] began when Royko wrote a column questioning why Chicago police offered free protection to Sinatra when the singer had his own security. Sinatra fired off an angry letter in response calling Royko a "pimp", and threatening to "punch you in the mouth" for speculating that he wore a [[toupée]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://lettersofnote.com/2009/11/30/youre-nothing-but-a-pimp/ You're Nothing but a Pimp] ''lettersofnote.com'' (November 30, 2009); retrieved April 18, 2020&lt;/ref&gt; Royko auctioned the letter, the proceeds going to the [[Salvation Army]]. The winner of the auction was Vie Carlson, mother of [[Bun E. Carlos]] of the rock group [[Cheap Trick]]. After appearing on ''[[Antiques Roadshow (American TV program)|Antiques Roadshow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/video/antiques-roadshow-coming-up-monday-november-28th-at-87c-pm-madison-hour-1-1/ Appraisal: 1976 Frank Sinatra Signed Letter to Mike Royko] ''Antiques Roadshow'' (airdate: February 15, 2010); retrieved April 18, 2020&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson consigned the letter to [[Freeman's Auctioneers &amp; Appraisers]], which auctioned it in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2009/10/28/antique-inatra-letter/ "'Antique' $inatra Letter"] ''[[New York Post]]'' (October 28, 2009); retrieved April 18, 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinatra was also known for his generosity,{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=146}} particularly after his comeback. Kelley notes that when [[Lee J. Cobb]] nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with "books, flowers, delicacies", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his "finest acting" was yet to come.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=251–252}} In another instance, after an argument with manager Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new [[Cadillac]].{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=53}}

=== Alleged organized-crime links and Cal Neva Lodge ===

Sinatra became the stereotype of the "tough working-class Italian American", something which he embraced. He said that if it had not been for his interest in music, he would have likely ended up in a life of crime.{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=50}} [[Willie Moretti]] was Sinatra's [[Capo dei capi|godfather]] and the notorious [[underboss]] of the [[Genovese crime family]], and he helped Sinatra in exchange for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing Sinatra from his contract with Tommy Dorsey.{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=420}} Sinatra was present at the Mafia [[Havana Conference]] in 1946,{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=419}} and the press learned of his being there with [[Lucky Luciano]]. One newspaper published the headline "Shame, Sinatra".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=63}} He was reported to be a good friend of mobster [[Sam Giancana]],{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=343}} and the two men were seen playing golf together.{{sfn|Heymann|2014|p=287}} Kelley quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers that Sinatra "adored" [[Bugsy Siegel]], and boasted to friends about him and how many people he had killed.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=124–125}} Kelley says that Sinatra and mobster [[Joseph Fischetti]] had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like "Sicilian brothers".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=135}} She also states that Sinatra and [[Hank Sanicola]] were financial partners with [[Mickey Cohen]] in the gossip magazine ''Hollywood Night Life''.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=176}}

The FBI kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, who was a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent [[New Deal]] politics, and his friendship with [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1075739|title=Sinatra: The FBI Files|publisher=NPR|access-date=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI kept him under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s.

Kennedy]] was leading a crackdown on organized crime.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=327–329}} Sinatra said he was not involved: "Any report that I fraternized with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie".{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=49}}

In 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the [[Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino]], a casino hotel that straddles the California-Nevada state line on the north shores of [[Lake Tahoe]]. Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater which attracted his show business friends [[Red Skelton]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Victor Borge]], [[Joe E. Lewis]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Juliet Prowse]], the [[McGuire Sisters]], and others. By 1962, he reportedly held a 50-percent share in the hotel.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=347–348, 355}} Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]] in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith|first=Martin|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-03-31-lake-tahoe-rat-pack-casino_N.htm|title=Frank Sinatra's Lake Tahoe casino shuts down |work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2010|access-date=July 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204182309/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-03-31-lake-tahoe-rat-pack-casino_N.htm|archive-date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Kelley, Giancana blamed Sinatra for the ordeal and was fuming at the abuse he had given to the commission's chairman Ed Olsen.

Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his own world, which he was able to dominate—his career was centred around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|pp=76–78}} [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] referred to Sinatra as "often hailed as the greatest American singer of 20th-century popular music....Through his life and his art, he transcended the status of mere icon to become one of the most recognizable symbols of American culture."&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frank-Sinatra|title=Frank Sinatra|journal=Details|access-date=December 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gus Levene]] commented that Sinatra's strength was that when it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a "genius" ability and feeling, which with the "rare combination of voice and showmanship" made him the "original singer" which others who followed most tried to emulate.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=68}} [[George Roberts (trombonist)|George Roberts]], a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a "charisma, or whatever it is about him, that no one else had".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=32}} Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that "If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it".
