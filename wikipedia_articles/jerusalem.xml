===Etymology===
The name "Jerusalem" is variously etymologized to mean "foundation (Semitic ''yry''' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the god [[Shalim|Shalem]]";&lt;ref&gt;Meir Ben-Dov, ''Historical Atlas of Jerusalem'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen J.

[[Shalim]] or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the [[Canaanite religion]], whose name is based on the same root [[S-L-M]] from which the Hebrew word for "peace" is derived (''Salam'' or ''Shalom'' in modern Arabic and Hebrew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jerusalem|last=Elon|first=Amos|url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/tucker/hh362/TelAvivandJerusalem.HTM|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030310223636/http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/tucker/hh362/TelAvivandJerusalem.HTM|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 March 2003|isbn=0-00-637531-6|access-date=26 April 2007|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd|quote=The epithet may have originated in the ancient name of Jerusalem–Salem (after the pagan deity of the city), which is etymologically connected in the Semitic languages with the words for peace (shalom in Hebrew, salam in Arabic).|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren, H., ''Die Religionen des Alten Orients'' (Göttingen, 1979), 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew Bible and Jewish sources===
The form ''Yerushalem'' or ''Yerushalayim'' first appears in the Bible, in the [[Book of Joshua]]. According to a [[Midrash]], the name is a combination of two names united by God, ''Yireh'' ("the abiding place", the name given by [[Abraham]] to the place where [[sacrifice of Isaac|he planned to sacrifice his son]]) and ''[[Salem (Bible)|Shalem]]'' ("Place of Peace", the name given by high priest [[Shem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

===Jebus, Zion, City of David===
An ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the [[Gihon Spring]], was, according to the Bible named [[Jebusite|Jebus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Judges 19:10}}: יְב֔וּס הִ֖יא יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם: "Jebus, it [is] Jerusalem"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=1012257 |title= Bible, King James Version |work= umich.edu |access-date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=Gagrinp113&gt;{{Google books |id=lNV6-HsUppsC |page=113 |title=The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1}}, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Called the "Fortress of Zion" (''metsudat Zion''), it was renamed by David as the [[City of David]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|2 Samuel 5:7,9}}. cited Israel Finkelstein, Amihay Mazar, Brian B.

===Greek, Roman and Byzantine names===
In Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated ''Hierosolyma'' (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek ''hieròs'', ''ἱερός'', means holy), although the city was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] for part of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period of its history.

===Salem===
The [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Genesis Apocryphon|Apocryphon of Genesis]] of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier "Salem" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of [[Melchizedek]] in Genesis 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis 14:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early Hebrew sources,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', {{bibleref2|Jubilees 1:30}}, the [[Septuagint]] version of {{bibleref2|Jeremias 48:5}} (as Συχὲμ) and possibly the Masoretic text of {{bibleref2|Genesis 33:18}} (''see'' KJV and the margin translation of the Revised Version).&lt;/ref&gt; early Christian renderings of the verse&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', the [[Vulgate]] and [[Peshitta]] versions. J.A. Emerton, "The site of Salem: the City of Melchizedek ({{bibleref2|Genesis xiv 18}})," pp. 45–72 of ''Studies in the Pentateuch'' ed. by J.A. Emerton, vol. 41 of ''Supplements to Vetus Testamentum'' (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1990) ("Emerton"), p. 45. ''See also'' {{bibleref2|John 3:23}} where "Salim" or "Sylem" (Συχὲμ) is said to be near [[Ænon]], thought to be in the valley of [[Mount Ebal]], one of two mountains in the vicinity of Nablus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[targumim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Targum Onkelos|Onklelos]], [[Pseudo-Jonathan]] and [[Targum Neofiti|Neofiti I]]. Emerton, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; however, put Salem in Northern Israel near [[Shechem]] (Sichem), now [[Nablus]], a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis 12:6–7}} (where Abram built an altar), {{bibleref2|Genesis 33:18–20, Deuteronomy 11:29 &amp; 28:11, Joshua 8:33, 1 Kings 12}}. Emerton, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the [[Samaritans]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Winter, "Note on Salem – Jerusalem", ''Novum Testamentum'', vol. 2, pp. 151–152 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.templestudiesgroup.com/Papers/Robert_Hayward.pdf |last= Raymond Hayward |title= Melchizedek as Priest of the Jerusalem Temple in Talmud, Midrash, and Targum |publisher= The Temple Studies Group |access-date= 24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic names===
In Arabic, Jerusalem is most commonly known as {{lang|ar|القُدس}}, transliterated as ''al-Quds'' and meaning "The Holy" or "The Holy Sanctuary".&lt;ref name=Bosworth/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeGarmo/&gt; It is pronounced /il.ʔu.ds/ in [[Palestinian Arabic]]. Official Israeli government policy mandates that {{lang|ar|أُورُشَلِيمَ}}, transliterated as ''Ūršalīm'', which is the cognate of the Hebrew and English names, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with {{lang|ar|القُدس}}. {{lang|ar|أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_main/defaultnew.asp?lng=3 |title=The Official Website of Jerusalem |date=19 September 2011 |publisher=Municipality of Jerusalem |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427222723/http://www.hotzvim.org.il/SiteFiles/1/35/901.asp |archive-date=27 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called "''Qudsi''" or "''Maqdisi''", while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a [[demonym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sonbol|first1=Amira|title=Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History|date=1996|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Graphical Overview of Jerusalem's Historical Periods}}

===Age===
====Jerusalem proper====
For historians and archaeologists, it is Jerusalem's South-East Hill, known as the City of David, that is taken into consideration when discussing the age of Jerusalem, since it is the most widely accepted site considered to be where permanent settlement began in ancient Jerusalem.

====Shuafat====
There have been confusing press headings claiming that the age of Jerusalem has to be pushed back, when in fact the respective articles were dealing with findings from nearby Shuafat, a town that historically and archaeologically cannot be equated with Jerusalem.

After the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, [[Shuafat]] was incorporated into the Jerusalem municipal district, in a move not internationally recognized.&lt;ref name=Kershner&gt;{{cite news|title=Under a Divided City, Evidence of a Once United One|author=Isabel Kershner|date=5 June 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/world/middleeast/05jerusalem.html|access-date=29 January 2008 |work=The New York Times|author-link=Isabel Kershner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Browning, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-jerusalem-idUSBRE9BJ0MX20131220 'In bleak Arab hinterland, hints of Jerusalem's partition,'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924191909/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-israel-palestinians-jerusalem-idUSBRE9BJ0MX20131220 |date=24 September 2015 }} [[Reuters]] 20 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Shuafat lies about 6&amp;nbsp;kilometres north of Jerusalem's oldest historical part, the so-called [[City of David]], and about 5&amp;nbsp;kilometres north of the walled Old City.

The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200–1000&amp;nbsp;BCE). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period." (pp. 6–7).

A messianic [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] movement to gather in Jerusalem took place at the turn of the millennium, leading to a "Golden Age" of Karaite scholarship there, which was only terminated by the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;David E.

In 1099, the Fatimid ruler expelled the native Christian population before Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|besieged]] by the soldiers of the [[First Crusade]]. After taking the solidly defended city by assault, the Crusaders massacred most of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, and made it the capital of their [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The city, which had been virtually emptied, was recolonized by a variegated inflow of [[Greeks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Syrians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Nestorians]], [[Maronites]], [[Jacob Baradeus|Jacobite]] Miaphysites, [[Copts]] and others, to block the return of the surviving Muslims and Jews. The north-eastern quarter was repopulated with Eastern Christians from the Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Boas, ''Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades'', Routledge 2001, pp. 14, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, by 1099 Jerusalem's population had climbed back to some 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hull |first=Michael D. |date=June 1999 |title=First Crusade: Siege of Jerusalem |journal=Military History |url=http://www.historynet.com/historical_conflicts/3028446.html?page=4&amp;c=y |access-date=18 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181302/http://www.historynet.com/historical_conflicts/3028446.html?page=4&amp;c=y |archive-date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], who generally remained in control until 1917.&lt;ref name="century1"/&gt; Jerusalem enjoyed a prosperous period of renewal and peace under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]—including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Cohen. "Economic Life in Ottoman Jerusalem"; Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The English reference book ''Modern history or the present state of all nations'', written in 1744, stated that "Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine, though much fallen from its ancient grandeaur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern history or the present state of all nations|last=Salmon|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Salmon (historian)|page=461|year=1744|url={{Google books |id=f7I-AAAAcAAJ |page=534 |plainurl=yes}} |access-date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates and regular stagecoach and carriage services were among the first signs of modernization in the city.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm |title=The Ottoman Period (1517–1917 CE) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231040026/http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm |archive-date=31 December 2009 |publisher=[[Hebrew University]] |year=2002 |access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt;

With the annexation of Jerusalem by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In 1836, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] allowed Jerusalem's Jewish residents to restore four major synagogues, among them the [[Hurva Synagogue|Hurva]].&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the countrywide [[Peasants' Revolt of 1834 (Palestine)|Peasants' Revolt]], [[Qasim al-Ahmad]] led his forces from [[Nablus]] and attacked Jerusalem, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, and entered the city on 31 May 1834.

Ottoman rule was reinstated in 1840, but many Egyptian Muslims remained in Jerusalem and Jews from [[Algiers]] and North Africa began to settle in the city in growing numbers.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt; In the 1840s and 1850s, the international powers began a tug-of-war in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the region's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through consular representatives in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', Jerusalem, Keter, 1978, Volume 9, "State of Israel (Historical Survey)", pp. 304–06&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt; The volume of Christian pilgrims increased under the Ottomans, doubling the city's population around Easter time.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, new neighborhoods [[Expansion of Jerusalem in the 19th century|began to develop]] outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city.

The great number of Christian orphans resulting from the [[1860 Mount Lebanon civil war|1860 civil war in Mount Lebanon and the Damascus massacre]] led in the same year to the opening of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany#History|German Protestant]] Syrian Orphanage, better known as the [[Schneller Orphanage]] after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fruma Zachs|year=2019|title=Children in war time: the first pupils of the Syrian (Schneller) orphanage in Jerusalem 1860–1863|journal=[[Middle Eastern Studies]]|volume=55|issue=6|pages=958–73|doi= 10.1080/00263206.2019.1616546 |s2cid=202281138|url= https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00263206.2019.1616546|access-date=21 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1880s there were no formal Jewish orphanages in Jerusalem, as families generally took care of each other.

The British had to deal with a conflicting demand that was rooted in Ottoman rule. Agreements for the supply of water, electricity, and the construction of a tramway system—all under concessions granted by the Ottoman authorities—had been signed by the city of Jerusalem and a Greek citizen, Euripides Mavromatis, on 27 January 1914. Work under these concessions had not begun and, by the end of the war the British occupying forces refused to recognize their validity. Mavromatis claimed that his concessions overlapped with the Auja Concession that the government had awarded to Rutenberg in 1921 and that he had been deprived of his legal rights. The Mavromatis concession, in effect despite earlier British attempts to abolish it, covered Jerusalem and other localities (e.g., Bethlehem) within a radius of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine.

As the British Mandate for Palestine was expiring, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 UN Partition Plan]] recommended "the creation of a special international regime in the City of Jerusalem, constituting it as a ''[[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]]'' under the administration of the UN."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/52b7d0e66142a40e85256dc70072b982/6362111f689724d705256601007063f2!OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126145437/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/52b7d0e66142a40e85256dc70072b982/6362111f689724d705256601007063f2%21OpenDocument |archive-date=26 January 2008 |publisher=The United Nations |date=22 January 1948 |access-date=3 February 2007 |title=Considerations Affecting Certain of the Provisions of the General Assembly Resolution on the 'Future Government of Palestine': The City of Jerusalem |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The international regime (which also included the city of [[Bethlehem]]) was to remain in force for a period of ten years, whereupon a referendum was to be held in which the residents were to decide the future regime of their city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/7F0AF2BD897689B785256C330061D253 |title=U.N.

In contradiction to the Partition Plan, which envisioned a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|city]] separated from the Arab state and the Jewish state, Israel took control of the area which later would become West Jerusalem, along with [[1948 Arab–Israeli War#1949 Armistice Agreements|major parts of the Arab territory allotted to the future Arab State]]; Jordan took control of East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank. The war led to displacement of Arab and Jewish populations in the city. The 1,500 residents of the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of the Old City were expelled and a few hundred taken prisoner when the Arab Legion captured the quarter on 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''1948'' (2008), pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Weingarten&lt;/ref&gt; Arab residents of [[Katamon]], [[Talbiya]], and the [[German Colony, Jerusalem|German Colony]] were driven from their homes. By the time of the armistice that ended active fighting, Israel had control of 12 of Jerusalem's 15 Arab residential quarters. An estimated minimum of 30,000 people had become refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Cattan, Henry (1981). ''Jerusalem''. Croom Helm. {{ISBN|0-7099-0412-6}}. p. 51.

The war of 1948 resulted in the division of Jerusalem, so that the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] lay entirely on the Jordanian side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|line]]. A no-man's land between East and West Jerusalem came into being in November 1948: [[Moshe Dayan]], commander of the Israeli forces in Jerusalem, met with his Jordanian counterpart [[Abdullah el-Tell]] in a deserted house in Jerusalem's [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara]] neighborhood and marked out their respective positions: Israel's position in red and Jordan's in green. This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final [[Green Line (Israel)|line]] in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which divided the city and left [[Mount Scopus]] as an Israeli [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] inside [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jposttravel.com/jerusalem_tours/FormerIsrael1008.html |title=No Man's Land |publisher=Jposttravel.com |access-date=11 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124081714/http://jposttravel.com/jerusalem_tours/FormerIsrael1008.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the center of the city, passing close by [[Jaffa Gate]] on the western side of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]], and a crossing point was established at [[Mandelbaum Gate]] slightly to the north of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]].

In 1967, despite Israeli pleas that Jordan remain neutral during the [[Six-Day War]], [[Six-Day War#West Bank|Jordan, which had concluded a defense agreement with Egypt on 30 May 1967, attacked Israeli-held West Jerusalem on the war's second day]]. After hand-to-hand fighting between Israeli and Jordanian soldiers on the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Israel Defense Forces]] captured East Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank. On 27 June 1967, three weeks after the war ended, in the [[reunification of Jerusalem]], Israel extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, including the city's Christian and Muslim holy sites, along with some nearby West Bank territory which comprised 28 Palestinian villages, incorporating it into the Jerusalem Municipality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/13+Law+and+Administration+Ordinance+-Amendment+No.htm |title=13 Law and Administration Ordinance – Amendment No |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |access-date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/For-Jerusalem-455837 Abraham Rabinovich, ''For Jerusalem: 49 years later true unity remains elusive'', in Jerusalem Post, 11 June 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; although it carefully avoided using the term annexation. On 10 July, Foreign Minister Abba Eban explained to the UN Secretary General: "''The term 'annexation' which was used by supporters of the vote is not accurate. The steps that were taken [by Israel] relate to the integration of Jerusalem in administrative and municipal areas, and served as a legal basis for the protection of the holy places of Jerusalem."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=DA4-XPy-6hIC |page=53 |title=Jerusalem Syndrome – The Palestinian–Israeli Battle for the Holy City}}, pp. 53–54. Mosheh ʻAmirav, Sussex University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Israel conducted a census of Arab residents in the areas annexed. Residents were given permanent residency status and the option of applying for Israeli citizenship.

On 2 October 1977, the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] approved the plan, and seven neighborhoods were subsequently built on the city's eastern edges. They became known as the [[Ring Neighborhoods, Jerusalem|Ring Neighborhoods]].

As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of [[Levi Eshkol]] extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm |title=Jerusalem in International Diplomacy |author=Dore Gold |access-date=20 July 2008|author-link=Dore Gold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Israel ordered the closure of [[Orient House]], home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/cultural_dimensions/3.htm |title=The New Orient House: A History of Palestinian Hospitality |publisher=jerusalemites.org |access-date=9 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101217143302/http://jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/cultural_dimensions/3.htm |archive-date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Jerusalem: The Future of a Contested City |last=Klein |first=Menachem |isbn=0-8147-4754-X |publisher=New York University Press |year= 2001 |page=189 |chapter=The PLO and the Palestinian Identity of East Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oslo Accords]] stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]].

Due to its proximity to the city, especially the [[Temple Mount]], [[Abu Dis]], a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell G.

===International status===
While the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the [[occupied Palestinian territories]], neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the [[State of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/the-controversial-sovereignty-over-the-city-of-jerusalem The Controversial Sovereignty over the City of Jerusalem (22 June 2015, The National Catholic Reporter)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121191334/https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/the-controversial-sovereignty-over-the-city-of-jerusalem |date=21 November 2018 }} "No U.S. president has ever officially acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem (...)

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] (20 August 1980; 14–0, U.S. abstaining) declared the Jerusalem Law "null and void" and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem (see {{Harvard citation no brackets|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}). See [[Status of Jerusalem]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] adopted by the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]] administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by [[Jordan]]. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city.&lt;ref&gt;"UN General Assembly Resolution 181 recommended the creation of an international zonea, or&amp;nbsp;corpus separatum, in Jerusalem to be administered by the UN for a 10-year period, after which there would be referendum to determine its future.&amp;nbsp;This approach applies equally to West and East Jerusalem and is not affected by the occupation of East jerusalem in 1967.&amp;nbsp;To a large extent it is this approach that still guides the diplomatic behaviour of states and thus has greater force in international law" (Susan M. Akram, Michael Dumper, Michael Lynk, Iain Scobbie (eds.),&amp;nbsp;International Law and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: A Rights-Based Approach to Middle East Peace,&amp;nbsp;Routledge, 2010 p.119. )&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status under Israeli rule===

Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.

In 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister [[Moshe Kahlon]] said that the bill sent "a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided", and that "all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tzippe Barrow|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/October/Bill-to-Grant-Jerusalem-Priority-Status/|title=Bill to Grant Jerusalem Priority Status – Inside Israel – CBN News – Christian News 24–7|publisher=CBN.com|date=25 October 2010|access-date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 1949, Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's "eternal" and "sacred" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had "compelled" the Israeli leadership "to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv", while "for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only – Jerusalem the Eternal", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for "the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="ben-gurion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/docs/eng/bengurion-jer.htm|last=Ben-Gurion|first=David|author-link=David Ben-Gurion|publisher=The Knesset|title=Statements of the Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion Regarding Moving the Capital of Israel to Jerusalem|date=5 December 1949|access-date=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]]—[[Politics of Israel#Legislative branch|legislative]], [[Politics of Israel#Judicial system|judicial]], and [[Politics of Israel#Prime Ministers and governments in the last ten years|executive]]—have resided there, except for the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]], which is located at [[HaKirya]] in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4181.IH: |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903233952/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105%3AH.R.4181.IH%3A |archive-date= 3 September 2015 |publisher=The Library of Congress |title=Jerusalem and Berlin Embassy Relocation Act of 1998 |access-date=12 February 2007 |url-status=dead |date= 25 June 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1950/01/25/archive/knesset-proclaims-jerusalem-as-israels-capital-mapam-and-herut-abstain-from-voting|title=Knesset Proclaims Jerusalem As Israel's Capital; Mapam and Herut Abstain from Voting|date=25 January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950,&lt;ref name="JTA"/&gt; Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.

The PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint ''development council'' would be responsible for coordinated development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nad-plo.org/userfiles/file/Factsheet%202013/EJ%20TODAY_FINAL%20REPORT_II.pdf |website=East Jerusalem today |title= Palestine's Capital: The 1967 border in Jerusalem and Israel's illegal policies on the ground |access-date=5 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825020708/http://www.nad-plo.org/userfiles/file/Factsheet%202013/EJ%20TODAY_FINAL%20REPORT_II.pdf |archive-date=25 August 2013|publisher=PLO-Negotiations Affairs Department (NAD) |date= August 2013 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal administration==
{{main|Municipality of Jerusalem}}

The Jerusalem [[city council|City Council]] is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, [[Uri Lupolianski]], was elected in 2003.&lt;ref name="corridors"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879092720&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=28 March 2007 |date=15 March 2007 |title=Corridors of Power: A tale of two councils |last=Cidor |first=Peggy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012336/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879092720&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2008 city elections, [[Nir Barkat]] was elected. In November 2018, [[Moshe Lion]] was elected mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moshe Lion elected Jerusalem Mayor in dramatic finish|url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-moshe-lion-elected-jerusalem-mayor-in-dramatic-finish-1001260573|date=14 November 2018|access-date=15 December 2018|first=Tal|last=Schneider|newspaper=[[Globes (newspaper)|Globes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216074141/https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-moshe-lion-elected-jerusalem-mayor-in-dramatic-finish-1001260573|archive-date=16 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was [[Teddy Kollek]], who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public.&lt;ref name="corridors"/&gt; Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jerusalem Becomes A Battleground Over Gay Rights Vs.

In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built on.&lt;ref name="Thrall"/&gt;

In biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

{{Main|Demographic history of Jerusalem}}
Jerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since medieval times, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem has been divided into [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish]], [[Muslim Quarter (Jerusalem)|Muslim]], [[Christian Quarter|Christian]], and [[Armenian Quarter|Armenian quarters]].

Most population data before 1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the [[Jerusalem District]].&lt;ref&gt;Usiel Oskar Schmelz, in Ottoman Palestine, 1800–1914: studies in economic and social history, Gad G. Gilbar, Brill Archive, 1990 {{Google books |id=sdYUAAAAIAAJ |title=Ottoman Palestine 1800 - 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates suggest that since the end of the [[Crusades]], Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.

Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.

In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] communities. Consequently, the [[total fertility rate]] in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades.

While some Israelis avoid Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, the city has attracted Palestinians, offering more jobs and opportunity than any city in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip]].

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the [[Jerusalem Development Authority]] proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.&lt;ref name="laub2006"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120200463_pf.html|title=Jerusalem Barrier Causes Major Upheaval|date=2 December 2006|agency=Associated Press|work=The Washington Post|last=Laub|first=Karin|access-date=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012, it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peggy Cidor |url=http://www.jpost.com/InJerusalem/CityFront/Article.aspx?id=270431 |title=Jerusalem 2012 – the state of things|work=The Jerusalem Post |date=17 May 2012 |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/155980 |title=Jewish Birthrate Up, Arab Rate Down in Jerusalem – Inside Israel  |publisher=Arutz Sheva |date=20 May 2012 |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighborhood of [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] and constituted three percent of the population in [[Neve Ya'akov]]. In the [[French Hill]] neighborhood, Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Hubbard |url=http://www.cjp.org/page.aspx?id=206230 |title=Holy city twist: Arabs moving into Jewish areas |work=Cjp.org |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730093730/http://www.cjp.org/page.aspx?id=206230 |archive-date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents.

Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protecting Jerusalem's Holy Sites: A Strategy for Negotiating a Sacred Peace|url=https://archive.org/details/protectingjerusa00guin|url-access=limited|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2006|edition=1st|last=Guinn|first=David E.|isbn=0-521-86662-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/protectingjerusa00guin/page/n151 142]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy.

Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its [[Old Testament]] history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the [[New Testament]], Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]]: "And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought [Jesus] to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;" ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2:22)&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]]: "And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;" ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 11:15)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cenacle]], believed to be the site of Jesus' [[Last Supper]], is located on [[Mount Zion]] in the same building that houses the [[David's Tomb|Tomb of King David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades|url=https://archive.org/details/jerusalemtimecru00boas|url-access=limited|last=Boas|first=Adrian J.|publisher=Routledge|year= 2001|isbn=0-415-23000-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/jerusalemtimecru00boas/page/n128 112]|chapter=Physical Remains of Crusader Jerusalem|quote=The interesting, if not reliable illustrations of the church on the round maps of Jerusalem show two distinct buildings on Mount Zion: the church of St Mary and the Cenacle (Chapel of the Last Supper) appear as separate buildings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Life of Jesus|last=Endo|first=Shusaku|author-link=Shusaku Endo|isbn=0-8091-2319-3|year=1999|editor=Richard A.

===High-rise construction===
Jerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a [[skyscraper]] by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/statistics/tallest-buildings-jerusalem-israel |title=Jerusalem's tallest buildings – Top 20 &amp;#124; Statistics |publisher=Emporis |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/holylandtower2-jerusalem-israel |title=Holyland Tower 2 &amp;#124; Buildings |location=Jerusalem / |publisher=Emporis |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line [[Jaffa Road]] and [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George Street]]. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the [[Jerusalem Chords Bridge]] and the [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station|Central Bus Station]], twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an [[Jerusalem Binyanei HaUma Railway Station|underground train station]] serving a new express line between Jerusalem and [[Tel Aviv]], and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and [[Israel State Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasson |first=Nir |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jerusalem-skyline-to-undergo-massive-transformation-with-12-new-skyscrapers.premium-1.458031 |title=Jerusalem skyline to undergo massive transformation with 12 new skyscrapers Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |work=Haaretz |date=2 April 2008 |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dvir |first=Noam |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/jerusalem-reaches-for-the-heavens-1.347554 |title=Jerusalem reaches for the heavens – Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |work=Haaretz |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lidman |first=Melanie |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=281153 |title=Interior Ministry approves 12 skyscrapers for J'lem |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=14 August 2012 |access-date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelity.com/2011/03/07/a-revitalized-downtown-jerusalem-with-skyscrapers/ |title=A revitalized downtown Jerusalem – with skyscrapers |publisher=Israelity |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=7 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512123533/http://israelity.com/2011/03/07/a-revitalized-downtown-jerusalem-with-skyscrapers/ |archive-date=12 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/migdal-merkaz-hayekum-jerusalem-israel |title=Migdal Merkaz HaYekum &amp;#124; Buildings |location=Jerusalem / |publisher=Emporis |access-date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]] and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it is set to break ground by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/08/03/daniel_libeskind_s_pyramid_in_jerusalem_the_new_skyscraper_will_be_the_city.html |title=The "Pyramid" Will Be the Newest Addition to Jerusalem's Skyline |date=3 August 2015 |work=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies operate from [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station]]. Arab neighborhoods in [[East Jerusalem]] and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the [[West Bank]] are served by the [[East Jerusalem Central Bus Station]], a transportation hub located near the Old City's [[Damascus Gate]]. The [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city center to Mt. Herzl in the south.
