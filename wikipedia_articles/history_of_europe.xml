The '''history of Europe''' concerns itself with the discovery and collection, the study, organization and presentation and the interpretation of past events and affairs of the people of [[Europe]] since the beginning of written records. During the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] and the time of the [[Indo-European migrations]], Europe saw human inflows from east and southeast and subsequent important cultural and material exchange. The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[ancient Greece]]. Later, the [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. Beginning in the 14th century a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England. After 1800, the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. The main European powers set up colonies in most of the Americas and Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 20th century, [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] resulted in massive numbers of deaths. The [[Cold War]] dominated European geo-politics from 1947 to 1989. After the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], the European countries grew together.

==Overview==
During the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] (starting at c. 7000 BC.) and the time of the [[Indo-European migrations]] (starting at c. 4000 BC.) Europe saw massive migrations from east and southeast which also brought agriculture, new technologies, and the Indo-European languages, primarily through the areas of the [[Balkan peninsula]] and the [[Black sea]] region.

Some of the best-known civilizations of the late prehistoric Europe were the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]], which flourished during the [[Bronze Age]] until they [[Bronze Age collapse|collapsed]] in a short period of time around 1200 BC.

The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. After ultimately checking the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] advance in Europe through the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the 5th century BC, Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout Asia, Africa, and other parts of Europe.

The [[Thracians]], their powerful [[Odrysian kingdom]], distinct [[Thracian treasure|culture]] and [[Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari|architecture]] were long present in Southeast Europe. 

The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Germanic peoples]] of Northern Europe, pressed by the [[Huns]], grew in strength and led repeated attacks that resulted in the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. The Western empire's collapse in AD 476 traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]].

In Western Europe, Germanic peoples became more powerful in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the [[Franks]] would rise to a position of [[hegemony]] over Western Europe, the [[Frankish Empire]] reaching its peak under [[Charlemagne]] around 800. This empire was later divided into several parts; [[West Francia]] would evolve into the [[Kingdom of France]], while [[East Francia]] would evolve into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a precursor to modern Germany and Italy. The [[British Isles]] were the site of several large-scale migrations.

The [[Byzantine Empire]] – the eastern part of the [[Roman Empire]], with its capital [[Constantinople]], survived for the next 1000 years. During most of its existence, the empire was the most dominant [[List of empires|empire]], also most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The powerful and long lived [[Bulgarian Empire]] was its main competitor in the region of Southeast Europe for centuries. Byzantine [[Byzantine art|art]], [[Byzantine architecture|architecture]], [[Third Rome|political dominance]], and [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|Bulgarian cultural]] and [[Cyrillic script|linguistic]] achievements left great legacy in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Slavs|Slavic]] Europe and beyond through the [[Middle Ages]] to this day.

The [[Viking Age]], a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, occurred from the late 8th century to the middle 11th century. The [[Normans]], descendants of the [[Vikings]] who settled in Northern France, had a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the [[Norman conquest of England]] to [[Norman conquest of Sicily|Sicily]]. The [[Rus' people]] founded [[Kievan Rus']], which evolved into Russia. After 1000 the [[Crusades]] were a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back under Christian rule. The Crusaders opened trade routes which enabled the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberia]] for [[Christendom]].

Eastern Europe in the [[High Middle Ages]] was dominated by the rise and fall of the [[Mongol Empire]]. Led by [[Genghis Khan]], the Mongols were a group of [[steppe nomad]]s who established a decentralized empire which, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic Seas in Europe. As Mongol power waned towards the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would grow into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1547. The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the [[Kalmar Union]] dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and with France in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In Central Europe, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an [[elective monarchy]], came to be dominated for centuries by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] overran Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, which historians mark as the end of the Middle Ages.

Beginning in the 14th century in [[Florence]] and later spreading through Europe, a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge had an enormous liberating effect on intellectuals. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] seized control of the English Church and its lands. The [[European religious wars]] were fought between German and Spanish rulers. The [[Reconquista]] ended Muslim rule in [[Iberia]]. By the 1490s a series of oceanic explorations marked the [[Age of Discovery]], establishing direct links with Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia. Religious wars continued to be fought in Europe, until the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The [[Spanish empire|Spanish crown]] maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and the world in the period between 1610 and 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, "States Make War But Wars Also Break States,"''Journal of Military History'' (2010) 74#1 pp. 11–34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]. The [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by coal, propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 19th-century Northwestern Europe.]]

The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain|Britain]], based on coal, steam, and textile mills. Political change in [[continental Europe]] was spurred by the [[French Revolution]] under the motto ''[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control, made many reforms inside France, and transformed Western Europe. But his rise stimulated both nationalism and reaction and he was defeated in 1814–15 as the old royal conservatives returned to power.

The period between 1815 and 1871 saw revolutionary attempts in much of Europe (apart from Britain). They all failed however. As industrial work forces grew in Western Europe, [[socialism]] and trade union activity developed. The last vestiges of [[serfdom]] were abolished [[Serfdom in Russia|in Russia]] in 1861. Greece and the other [[Balkans|Balkan nations]] began a long slow road to [[History of the Balkans|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], starting in the 1820s. Italy was unified in its [[Risorgimento]] in 1860. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, [[Otto von Bismarck]] unified the German states into an empire that was politically and militarily dominant until 1914. Most of Europe scrambled for imperial colonies [[Scramble for Africa|in Africa]] and Asia in [[the Age of Empire]]. Britain and France built the largest empires, while diplomats ensured there were no major wars in Europe, apart from the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s.

The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in Southeastern Europe as the [[Great Powers]] took sides. The 1917 [[October Revolution]] led the [[Russian Empire]] to become the world's first [[communist state]], the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], led by Britain, France, and the United States, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The war's human and material devastation was unprecedented.

Germany lost its overseas empire and several provinces, had to pay large reparations, and was humiliated by the victors. They in turn had large debts to the United States. The 1920s were prosperous until 1929 when the [[Great Depression]] broke out, which led to the collapse of democracy in many European states. The [[Nazi]] regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, rearmed Germany, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to assert themselves on the continent. Other nations, who had not taken to the attractions of fascism, sought to avoid conflict. They set boundaries of [[appeasement]], which Hitler continually ignored. The [[Second World War]] began. The war ended with the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] but the threat of more conflict was recognised before the war's end. Many from the US were suspicious of how the USSR would treat the peace – in the USSR there was paranoia at US forces in Europe. [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]/[[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] meetings among leaders in [[Yalta]] proved inconclusive. In the closing months of the war there was a race to the finish. The territories captured from the Nazis by troops from the USSR found they had exchanged Hitler for Stalin. The USSR would not leave those territories for forty years. The USSR claimed they needed buffer states between them and the nascent [[NATO]]. In the west, the term [[Iron Curtain]] entered the language. The United States launched the [[Marshall Plan]] from 1948 to 1951 and [[NATO]] from 1949, and rebuilt industrial economies that all were thriving by the 1950s. France and [[West Germany]] took the lead in forming the [[European Economic Community]], which eventually became the [[European Union]] (EU). Secularization saw the weakening of Protestant and Catholic churches across most of Europe, except where they were symbols of anti-government resistance, as in Poland. The [[Revolutions of 1989]] brought an end to both Soviet hegemony and [[communism]] in Eastern Europe. Germany was reunited, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], and both NATO and the EU expanded to the east. The EU came under increasing pressure because of the [[Great Recession|worldwide recession after 2008]].

''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated from Africa to Europe before the emergence of modern humans. ''[[Homo erectus georgicus]]'', which lived roughly 1.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], is the earliest [[hominid]] to have been discovered in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=A.

The earliest appearance of [[anatomically modern humans|anatomically modern people]] in Europe has been dated to 35,000 BC, usually referred to as the Cro-Magnon. The earliest sites in Europe are
[[Riparo Mochi]] (Italy), [[Geissenklösterle]] (Germany), and [[Isturitz]] (France).&lt;ref&gt;42.7–41.5 ka ([[68–95–99.7 rule|1σ CI]]).
Katerina Douka et al., A new chronostratigraphic framework for the Upper Palaeolithic of Riparo Mochi (Italy), ''Journal of Human Evolution'' 62(2), 19 December 2011, 286–299, {{doi|10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some locally developed transitional cultures ([[Uluzzian]] in Italy and Greece, Altmühlian in Germany, [[Szeletian]] in Central Europe and [[Châtelperronian]] in the southwest) use&lt;!-- "used"? --&gt; clearly [[Upper Palaeolithic]] technologies at very early dates.

Nevertheless, the definitive advance of these technologies is made by the [[Aurignacian]] culture. The origins of this culture can be located in the [[Levant]] (Ahmarian) and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000 BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last [[Neanderthals]] seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Around 29,000 BC a new technology/culture appeared in the western region of Europe: the [[Gravettian]]. This technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the [[Balkans]] (see [[Kozarnika]]).

Around 16,000 BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of a new culture, known as [[Magdalenian]], possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the [[Solutrean]] area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The [[Hamburg culture]] prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the [[Creswellian]] (also termed the British Late Magdalenian) did shortly after in the British Islands.
Around 12,500 BC, the [[Würm glaciation]] ended. Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000 BC, when it quickly evolved into two ''[[microlith]]ist'' cultures: [[Azilian]] ([[Federmesser]]), in Spain and southern France, and then [[Sauveterrian]], in southern France and [[Tardenoisian]] in Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the [[Lyngby culture|Lyngby complex]] succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the [[Federmesser]] group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans.

The [[Indo-European migrations]] started at around c. 4200 BC. through the areas of the [[Black sea]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]] in [[Eastern Europe|East]] and Southeast Europe. In the next 3000 years the [[Indo-European languages]] expanded through Europe.

In [[Varna Necropolis]] – a burial site from 4569 to 4340 BC and one of the most important archaeological sites in world prehistory, was found the oldest gold treasure (elaborated golden objects) in the world.&lt;ref name="La Niece"&gt;{{cite book |last=La Niece |first=Susan (senior metallurgist in the British Museum Department of Conservation and Scientific Research) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAfITjcHiZ0C |title=Gold |page=10 |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=10 April 2012 |isbn=978-0-674-03590-4 |date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently discovered golden artifacts in another site in [[Bulgaria]] near [[Durankulak]] appear to be 7,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-gold-object-unearthed-bulgaria-180960093/|title = World's Oldest Gold Object May Have Just Been Unearthed in Bulgaria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neolithic]] reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millenniums BC.

==Ancient Europe==
===Minoans and Mycenae 2000–1100 BC===
[[File:Tholos of Atreus.jpg|thumb|170px|The Treasury of [[Atreus]], or Tomb of Agamemnon in Mycenae 1250 BC]]

The first well-known literate civilization in Europe was that of the Minoans. The [[Minoan civilization]] was a [[Bronze Age]] civilization that arose on the island of [[Crete]] and flourished from approximately the 27th century BC to the 15th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 |title=Ancient Crete|publisher=Oxfordbibliographiesonline.com |date=15 February 2010 |access-date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century through the work of the British archaeologist [[Arthur Evans]]. [[Will Durant]] referred to it as "the first link in the European chain".&lt;ref&gt;Durant, ''The Life of Greece''; ''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster) 1939:11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minoans were replaced by the [[Mycenaean civilization]] which flourished during the period roughly between 1600 BC, when [[Helladic]] culture in mainland Greece was transformed under influences from Minoan Crete, and 1100 BC. The major Mycenaean cities were [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] in Argolis, [[Pylos]] in Messenia, [[Athens]] in Attica, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] in Boeotia, and [[Iolkos]] in Thessaly. In [[Crete]], the Mycenaeans occupied [[Knossos]]. Mycenaean settlement sites also appeared in [[Epirus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=N.G.L.|title=Migrations and invasions in Greece and adjacent areas|year=1976|publisher=Noyes P.|location=Park Ridge, NJ|isbn=978-0-8155-5047-1|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9saAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Moreover%2C+in+this+area+a+small+tholos-tomb+with+Mycenaean+pottery+of+III+B+style+and+a+Mycenaean+acropolis+have+been+reported+at+Kiperi+near+Parga%2C+and+another+Mycenaean+acropolis+lay+above+the+Oracle+of+the+Dead+on+the+hill+called+%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, p. xii.

Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, the center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called [[Linear A]]) to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Linear B]].

The Mycenaean civilization perished with the [[Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze-Age civilization]] on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the [[Dorian invasion]], although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after [[LH IIIC|LH III C]], when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the ''[[Greek Dark Ages]]'' of traditional historiography.

===Early antiquity period===
{{Main|Classical antiquity}}

[[File:Parthenon from south.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]], an [[Ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] Temple on the [[Acropolis]] (hill-top city) fell to Rome in 176 BC]]

The Greeks and the Romans left a legacy in Europe which is evident in European languages, [[Western philosophy|thought]], visual arts and law. Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, out of which the original form of democracy developed. [[Classical Athens|Athens]] was the most powerful and developed city, and a cradle of learning from the time of [[Pericles]]. Citizens' forums debated and legislated policy of the state, and from here arose some of the most notable classical philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], the last of whom taught [[Alexander the Great]].

Through his military campaigns, the king of the kingdom of [[Macedon]], Alexander, spread Hellenistic culture and learning to the banks of the [[River Indus]]. Meanwhile, the [[Roman Republic]] strengthened through victory over [[Carthage]] in the [[Punic Wars]]. Greek wisdom passed into Roman institutions, as Athens itself was absorbed under the banner of the Senate and People of Rome ([[Senatus Populusque Romanus|SPQR]]).

[[File:Europe-In-301BC.png|thumb|Europe in the year 301 BC|left]]

The Romans expanded their domains from Anatolia in the east to Britannia in the west. In 44 BC as it approached its height, its dictator [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] by senators in an attempt to restore the Republic. In the ensuing turmoil, [[Octavian]] (ruled as Augustus; and as ''divi filius'', or Son of God, as Julius had adopted him as an heir) usurped the reins of power and fought the Roman Senate. While proclaiming the rebirth of the Republic, he had ushered in the transfer of the Roman state from a republic to an empire, the [[Roman Empire]], which lasted for more than four centuries until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic period}}
The [[Hellenic civilisation]] was a collection of city-states or [[poleis]] with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.

The most powerful city-states were [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of [[direct democracy]] invented by [[Cleisthenes]]; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of [[Socrates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |first=Henry |last=Jackson|wstitle=Socrates |volume=25 |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], and the [[Platonic Academy]].

The Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and the Mediterranean ([[Asian Minor]], Sicily and Southern Italy in [[Magna Graecia]]). By the late 6th century BC, all the Greek [[city states]] in Asia Minor had been incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], while the latter had made territorial gains in the [[Balkans]] (such as [[Macedon]], [[Thracians|Thrace]], [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], etc.) and Eastern Europe proper as well. In the course of the 5th century BC, some of the Greek city states attempted to overthrow Persian rule in the [[Ionian Revolt]], which failed. This sparked the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first Persian invasion of mainland Greece]]. At some point during the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]], namely during the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], and precisely after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] and the [[Battle of Artemisium]], almost all of Greece to the north of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] had been overrun by the Persians,&lt;ref name="Warfare in the Ancient World"&gt;Brian Todd Carey, Joshua Allfree, John Cairns (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=3OSfBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32 ''Warfare in the Ancient World''] Pen and Sword, {{ISBN|1-84884-630-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Greek city states reached a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. With the end of the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians were eventually decisively forced to withdraw from their territories in Europe. The Greco-Persian Wars and the victory of the Greek [[city states]] directly influenced the entire further course of European history and would set its further tone.[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Alexander Mosaic|mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] battling [[Darius III]]]] Some Greek city-states formed the [[Delian League]] to continue fighting Persia, but Athens' position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival [[Peloponnesian League]]. The [[Peloponnesian War]]s ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with [[Spartan hegemony]] led to the [[Corinthian War]] and the defeat of Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. At the same time at the north ruled the Thracian [[Odrysian Kingdom]] between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD.

Hellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and [[Philip II of Macedon]] united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philip II, known as [[Alexander the Great]], invaded neighboring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], toppled and incorporated its domains, as well as invading Egypt and going as far off as [[India]], increasing contact with people and cultures in these regions that marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]].

After the death of Alexander, his empire split into multiple kingdoms ruled by his generals, the [[Diadochi]]. The Diadochi fought against each other in a series of conflicts called the [[Wars of the Diadochi]]. In the beginning of the 2nd century BC, only three major kingdoms remained: the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. These kingdoms spread Greek culture to regions as far away as [[Bactria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://explorethemed.com/Diadochi.asp?c=1 |title=The Diadochi and the Hellenistic Age |work=Historical Atlas of the Mediterranean |access-date=23 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Rise of Rome====

[[File:Cicerón denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] addresses the [[Roman Senate]] to denounce [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to overthrow the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]

Much of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies' inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]], and its defeats in the three [[Punic Wars]] marked the start of Roman [[hegemony]]. First governed by [[Roman kings|kings]], then as a senatorial republic (the [[Roman Republic]]), Rome finally became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under [[Augustus]] and his authoritarian successors.

[[File:Europe-In-117AD.png|thumb|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, under the emperor [[Trajan]]]]

The [[Roman Empire]] had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Under emperor [[Trajan]] (2nd century AD) the empire reached its maximum expansion, controlling approximately {{convert|5900000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land surface, including [[Italian Peninsula|Italia]], [[Gaul|Gallia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Aquitania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Baetica]], [[Hispania]], [[Odrysian kingdom|Thrace]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Moesia]], [[Dacia (Roman province)|Dacia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Egypt]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Caucasus]], North Africa, [[Levant]] and parts of [[Mesopotamia]]. [[Pax Romana]], a period of peace, [[Roman civilisation|civilisation]] and an efficient [[centralised government]] in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a [[Crisis of the Third Century|series of civil wars]] undermined Rome's economic and social strength.

In the 4th century, the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul). Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in 313 with the [[Edict of Milan]], thus setting the stage for the [[Christian Church|Church]] to become the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in about 380.

====Decline of the Roman Empire====
{{Main|Decline of the Roman Empire|Crisis of the Third Century}}
[[File:Partition of the Roman Empire in 395 AD.png|thumb|left|Map of the partition of the Roman Empire in 395, at the death of [[Theodosius I]]: the [[Western Roman Empire]] is shown in red and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) is shown in purple]]

The Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], surrendered to the Germanic King [[Odoacer]]. The British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] argued in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) that the Romans had become decadent and had lost civic virtue.

Gibbon said that the adoption of Christianity meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. "From the eighteenth century onward", Glen W. Bowersock has remarked,&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' '''49'''.8 (May 1996:29–43) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears." It remains one of the greatest historical questions, and has a tradition rich in scholarly interest.

Some other notable dates are the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the [[Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against [[Alaric I]], the death of [[Stilicho]] in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of [[Justinian I]], the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a "fall", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures |volume=A: To 1500 |author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R.

===Late Antiquity and Migration Period===
{{Main|Late Antiquity|Migration Period}}
[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|A simplified map of migrations from the 2nd to the 5th century. See also the [[:File:World 820.png|map of the world in 820 AD]].]]

When Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in 312, he soon afterwards issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (preceded by the [[Edict of Serdica]] in 311), declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma – it was later named Constantinople ("City of Constantine").

[[Theodosius I]], who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire, until his death in 395. The empire was split into two-halves: the [[Western Roman Empire]] centred in [[Ravenna]], and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) centred in Constantinople. The Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by [[Huns|Hunnic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and other "barbarian" tribes (see: [[Migration Period]]), and in 476 finally the [[Western Roman Empire|Western part]] fell to the [[Heruli]] chieftain [[Odoacer]].

[[File:Europa in 526.png|thumb|left|Map showing Europe in 526 AD with the three dominating powers of the west]]

Roman authority in the Western part of the empire had collapsed, and a power vacuum left in the wake of this collapse; the central organization, institutions, laws and power of Rome had broken down, resulting in many areas being open to invasion by migrating tribes. Over time, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] arose, two interlocking institutions that provided for division of land and labor, as well as a broad if uneven hierarchy of law and protection. These localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked, and to a lord, who would provide and administer both local law to settle disputes among the peasants, as well as protection from outside invaders. Unlike under Roman rule, with its standard laws and military across the empire and its great bureaucracy to administer them and collect taxes, each lord (although having obligations to a higher lord) was largely sovereign in his domain. A peasant's lot could vary greatly depending on the leadership skills and attitudes to justice of the lord toward his people. [[Tithe]]s or rents were paid to the lord, who in turn owed resources, and armed men in times of war, to his lord, perhaps a regional prince. However, the levels of hierarchy were varied over time and place.

The western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers: first, the [[Franks]] ([[Merovingian dynasty]]) in [[Francia]] 481–843 AD, which covered much of present France and Germany; second, the [[Visigothic kingdom]] 418–711 AD in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Spain); and third, the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] 493–553 AD in Italy and parts of the western [[Balkans]] The Ostrogoths were later replaced by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] 568–774 AD. These new powers of the west built upon the Roman traditions until they evolved into a synthesis of Roman and Germanic cultures. Although these powers covered large territories, they did not have the great resources and bureaucracy of the Roman empire to control regions and localities. The ongoing invasions and boundary disputes usually meant a more risky and varying life than that under the empire. This meant that in general more power and responsibilities were left to local lords. On the other hand, it also meant more freedom, particularly in more remote areas.

In Italy, [[Theodoric the Great]] began the cultural romanization of the new world he had constructed. He made [[Ravenna]] a center of Romano-Greek culture of art and his court fostered a flowering of literature and philosophy in [[Latin]]. In Iberia, [[Chindasuinth|King Chindasuinth]] created the [[Visigothic Code]].
&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Theology: The Middle Ages|author1=Di Berardino, A.|author2=D'Onofrio, G.|author3=Studer, B.|date=2008|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5916-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2o5V2GWlaFIC|page=26|access-date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern part the dominant state was the remaining [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]].

In the feudal system, new princes and kings arose, the most powerful of which was arguably the Frankish ruler [[Charlemagne]]. In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) by [[Pope Leo III]], effectively solidifying his power in western Europe. Charlemagne's reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The [[Kievan Rus']] were marking out their territory, a [[Great Moravia]] was growing, while the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] were securing their borders.

For the duration of the 6th century, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] (see [[Roman–Persian Wars]]), followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic [[Caliphate]] ([[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]). By 650, the provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Palestine and Syria]] were lost to the [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]], followed by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] in the 7th and 8th centuries (see [[Muslim conquests]]). The Arab invasion from the east was stopped after the intervention of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] (see [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Han Tervel]]).

==Post-classical Europe==
{{Main|Middle Ages|Medieval demography}}
The Middle Ages are commonly dated from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] (or by some scholars, before that) in the 5th century to the beginning of the [[early modern period]] in the 16th century, marked by the rise of [[nation state]]s, the division of Western Christianity in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the rise of [[humanism]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wise Bauer, ''The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA793|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=791–94|isbn=978-1-884964-33-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantium===
{{Main|Byzantine Empire}}
[[File:Hagia Sophia Southwestern entrance mosaics 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantine I]] and [[Justinian I]] offering their fealty to the Virgin Mary inside the [[Hagia Sophia]]]]

Many consider Emperor [[Constantine I]] (reigned 306–337) to be the first "[[Byzantine Emperor]]". It was he who moved the imperial capital in 324 from [[Nicomedia]] to [[Byzantium]], which re-founded as Constantinople, or Nova Roma ("[[New Rome]]").&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Banister, "Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture", Architectural Press; 20 edition (1996), {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2267-7}}, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] itself had not served as the capital since the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284–305). Some date the beginnings of the Empire to the reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379–395) and Christianity's official supplanting of the pagan [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], or following his death in 395, when the empire was split into two parts, with capitals in Rome and Constantinople. Others place it yet later in 476, when [[Romulus Augustulus]], traditionally considered the last western Emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the [[Greek East]]. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of [[Heraclius]] (c. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing [[Christianisation]] was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The [[Plague of Justinian]] was a [[pandemic]] that afflicted the [[Byzantine Empire]], including its capital [[Constantinople]], in the years 541–542. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpalm.med.uth.tmc.edu/courses/BT2003/BTstudents2003_files/Plague2003.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218044248/http://dpalm.med.uth.tmc.edu/courses/BT2003/BTstudents2003_files/Plague2003.htm|title=The History of the Bubonic Plague|archive-date=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1996/plague.htm |title=Scientists Identify Genes Critical to Transmission of Bubonic Plague |publisher=.niaid.nih.gov |access-date=31 January 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071007012619/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1996/plague.htm |archive-date = 7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It caused [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ralph R.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Early Middle Ages|Muslim Conquest}}
The Early Middle Ages span roughly five centuries from 500 to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Events used to mark the period's beginning include the sack of Rome by the [[Goths]] (410), the deposition of the last western [[Roman Emperor]] (476), the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] (496) and the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] (535–552). Particular events taken to mark its end include the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Otto I the Great]] (962), the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] (1054) and the [[Norman conquest of England]] (1066).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Europe 814.svg|thumb|300px|right|Europe in the [[Early Middle Ages]]]]
In the East and [[Southeast Europe|Southeast]] of Europe new dominant states formed: the [[Avar Khaganate]] (567–after 822), [[Old Great Bulgaria]] (632–668), the [[Khazars|Khazar Khaganate]] (c. 650–969) and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Danube Bulgaria]] (founded by [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Asparuh]] in 680) were constantly rivaling the hegemony of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

From the 7th century Byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of Islam and the [[Caliphates]]. Muslim [[Arabs]] first invaded historically Roman territory under [[Abū Bakr]], first Caliph of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], who entered [[Roman Syria]] and [[Roman Mesopotamia]]. As the Byzantines and neighboring [[Sasanids]] were severely weakened by the time, amongst the most important reason(s) being the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]], which included the climactic [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], under [[Umar]], the second Caliph, the Muslims entirely toppled the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian Empire]], and decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as [[Roman Palestine]], [[Roman Egypt]], and parts of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Africa Province|Roman North Africa]]. In the mid 7th century AD, following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Islam penetrated into the [[Caucasus]] region, of which parts [[Russo-Persian Wars|would later]] permanently become part of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=(..) It is difficult to establish exactly when Islam first appeared in Russia because the lands that Islam penetrated early in its expansion were not part of Russia at the time, but were later incorporated into the expanding Russian Empire. Islam reached the Caucasus region in the middle of the seventh century as part of the Arab [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest]] of the Iranian Sassanian Empire.|title=Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security|first=Shireen |last= Hunter | publisher= M.E. Sharpe | date = 2004 |page=3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend, which included the conquests by the invading Muslim forces and by that the spread of Islam as well continued under Umar's successors and under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], which conquered the rest of Mediterranean North Africa and most of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Iberian Peninsula]]. Over the next centuries Muslim forces were able to take further European territory, including [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Cyprus]], Malta, [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]], and [[history of Islam in southern Italy|Sicily and parts of southern Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hugh (1995).

The Muslim conquest of Hispania began when the [[Moors]] ([[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Arab]]s) invaded the Christian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom of [[Iberian peninsula|Hispania]] in the year 711, under the Berber general [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]]. They landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior, [[Musa ibn Nusair]]. During the eight-year campaign most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under Muslim rule – save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. In 711, [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne involving two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis within the [[Hispania|Hispano]]-[[Visigothic]] society to carry out their conquests. This territory, under the Arab name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad]] empire.

The [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) ended unsuccessfully after the intervention of [[Tervel of Bulgaria]] and weakened the [[Umayyad]] dynasty and reduced their prestige. In 722 [[Don Pelayo]], a [[nobleman]] of Visigothic origin, formed an army of 300 [[Astures|Astur]] soldiers, to confront Munuza's Muslim troops. In the [[battle of Covadonga]], the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the [[Reconquista]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the '[[Abbāsids]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. O´Callaghan, ''Reconquest and crusade in Medieval Spain'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 756, the Umayyads established an [[Emirate of Córdoba|independent emirate]] in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe|editor=George Holmes|isbn=978-0-19-820073-4|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00holm/page/371 371]|year=1988|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00holm/page/371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] emerged around 800, as [[Charlemagne]], King of the [[Franks]] and part of the [[Carolingian dynasty]], was crowned by the pope as emperor. His empire based in modern France, the [[Low Countries]] and Germany expanded into modern Hungary, Italy, [[Bohemia]], Lower Saxony and Spain. He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the [[Lombards]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frassetto, ''Early Medieval World, The: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; His death marked the beginning of the end of the dynasty, which collapsed entirely by 888. The fragmentation of power led to semiautonomy in the region, and has been defined as a critical starting point for the formation of [[state (polity)|states]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-032628|title=Beyond War and Contracts: The Medieval and Religious Roots of the European State|year=2020|last1=Grzymala-Busse|first1=Anna|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=23|pages=19–36|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the east, [[Bulgaria]] was established in 681 and became the first [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] country.{{cn|date=June 2021}} The powerful [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the [[Balkans]] for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The [[First Bulgarian Empire|Empire]] created the [[Cyrillic script]] during the 9th century AD, at the [[Preslav Literary School]], and experienced the [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|Golden Age]] of Bulgarian cultural prosperity during the reign of emperor [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I the Great]] (893–927). Two states, [[Great Moravia]] and [[Kievan Rus']], emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the [[Viking]]s who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the [[longship]]s. The [[Viking]]s had left a [[Culture|cultural]] influence on the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Franks]] as well as the [[Scottish people|Scots]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Lamoureux, "The influence of Vikings on European culture".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Invasion#Magyar invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] pillaged mainland Europe, the [[Pechenegs]] raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the [[Arab]] states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe including Poland and the newly settled [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|kingdom of Croatia]] also appeared in the [[Balkans]]. The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of [[feudalism]], which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.

In eastern Europe, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in 921, after [[Almış I]] converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mako, "The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in the early medieval period had mostly died out in western Europe by about the year 1000 AD, replaced by [[serfdom]]. It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Muslim world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians. Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher and Stanley L. Engerman, eds. ''A Historical Guide to World Slavery'' (1998) pp. 197–200&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Middle Ages===
{{Main|High Middle Ages}}
[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|Europe in 1097, as the [[First Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]] commences]]

The slumber of the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] was shaken by a renewed crisis in the Church. In 1054, the [[East–West Schism]], an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in [[Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul).

The High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a [[Medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150–1309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]&lt;/ref&gt;

From about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The [[Viking]]s had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Kingdom]] of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]], major barbarian incursions ceased.

[[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] sovereignty was reestablished with the [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|anti-Byzantine uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs]] in 1185. The crusaders invaded the [[Byzantine empire]], captured Constantinople in 1204 and established their [[Latin Empire]]. [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] defeated [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], [[Latin emperor of Constantinople]], in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] on 14 April 1205. The reign of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] led to maximum territorial expansion and that of [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] to a [[Architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School|Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture]]. The Byzantine Empire was fully reestablished in 1261.

In the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the "great clearances", vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the [[Elbe]] river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded [[Crusader states|European colonies]] in the [[Levant]], the majority of the [[Reconquista|Iberian Peninsula was conquered]] from the Muslims, and the [[Normans]] colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.

The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of [[Gothic architecture]], which evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]]. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian [[city-state]]s, such as [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who occupied the [[Holy Land]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]] led [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of [[Scholasticism]].

====A divided church====
{{Main|East–West Schism}}

The Great Schism between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by [[Pope Leo IX]] asserting authority over three of the seats in the [[Pentarchy]], in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. [[Antioch]] had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the [[filioque]] clause in the [[Nicene Creed]] which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over [[liturgy]]. The Schism of Roman Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] followed centuries of estrangement between the Latin and Greek worlds.

====Holy wars====
{{Main|Crusades|Reconquista}}
[[File:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siege of Antioch]], from a medieval miniature painting, during the [[First Crusade]]]]

After the [[East–West Schism]], [[Western Christianity]] was adopted by the newly created kingdoms of Central Europe: [[Poland]], Hungary and [[Bohemia]]. The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to the conversions of pagan kings (Scandinavia, [[Lithuania]], Poland, Hungary), the Christian [[Reconquista]] of [[Al-Andalus]], and the [[crusades]]. Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.

Early signs of the rebirth of civilization in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent [[city-state]]s such as [[Venice#History|Venice]] and [[History of Florence|Florence]]; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional [[Latin]]. Notable figures of this movement would include [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] (born Christina da Pizzano), the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian (Venice), relocated to France, writing in French. (See [[Reconquista]] for the latter two countries.) Elsewhere, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.

The 14th century, when the [[Mongol Empire]] came to power, is often called the ''Age of the Mongols''. Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]]. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110427075859/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2011 |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |access-date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kipchak-Cuman Confederation]]. [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], Hungary, and Poland managed to remain sovereign states. Mongolian records indicate that Batu Khan was planning a complete conquest of the remaining European powers, beginning with a winter attack on Austria, Italy and Germany, when he was recalled to [[Mongolia]] upon the death of Great Khan [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]]. Most historians believe only his death prevented the complete conquest of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The areas of Eastern Europe and most of Central Asia that were under direct Mongol rule became known as the [[Golden Horde]]. Under [[Uzbeg Khan]], Islam became the official religion of the region in the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037242/Golden-Horde Golden Horde]", in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The invading Mongols, together with their mostly Turkic subjects, were known as [[Tatar people|Tatars]]. In Russia, the Tatars ruled the various states of the Rus' through vassalage for over 300 years.

In the Northern Europe, [[Konrad of Masovia]] gave [[Chelmno]] to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1226 as a base for a Crusade against the [[Old Prussians]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] were defeated by the Lithuanians, so in 1237 Gregory IX merged the remainder of the order into the Teutonic Order as the [[Livonian Order]]. By the middle of the century, the Teutonic Knights completed their conquest of the Prussians before conquering and converting the Lithuanians in the subsequent decades. The order also came into conflict with the Eastern Orthodox Church of the [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] and [[Novgorod Republic]]s. In 1240 the Orthodox Novgorod army defeated the Catholic Swedes in the [[Battle of the Neva]], and, two years later, they defeated the Livonian Order in the [[Battle on the Ice]]. The [[Union of Krewo]] in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: [[Christianization of Lithuania|conversion to Catholicism]] and establishment of a [[dynastic union]] between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410.

===Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|Late Middle Ages|Lex mercatoria|Hundred Years' War|Fall of Constantinople}}
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|right|The spread of the "Black Death" from 1347 to 1351 through Europe]]

The Late Middle Ages spanned the 14th and early 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace K. Ferguson, ''Europe in transition, 1300–1520'' (1962) [https://archive.org/details/europeintransiti00ferg online].&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] and the [[Black Death]], killed people in a matter of days, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. [[Mark Kishlansky|Kishlansky]] reports:
:The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway.... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended. Traditional bonds of kinship, village, and even religion were broken amid the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. "People cared no more for dead men than we care for dead goats," wrote one survivor.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kishlansky et al. ''Civilization in the West: Volume 1 to 1715'' (5th ed. 2003) p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Depopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the [[Jacquerie]] and the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. At the same time, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. Collectively these events have been called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 14th century, the [[Baltic Sea]] became one of the most important [[trade route]]s. The [[Hanseatic League]], an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland, [[Lithuania]], and [[Terra Mariana|Livonia]] into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland-Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the [[Middle Ages]] is usually associated with the fall of the city of [[Constantinople]] and of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their [[Ottoman Empire]], which lasted until 1922 and included [[Egypt]], Syria, and most of the [[Balkans]]. The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], also sometimes referred to as the Turkish wars, marked an essential part of the history of the continent as a whole.

A key 15th-century development was the [[Global spread of the printing press|advent of the movable type of printing press]] circa 1439 in Mainz,&lt;ref name=body /&gt; building upon the impetus provided by the [[History of paper|prior introduction of paper]] from China via the Arabs in the High Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=books&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9opxcMjv4TUC&amp;q=1439&amp;pg=PA1|title=The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800|first1=Lucien|last1=Febvre|first2=Henri-Jean|year=1997|publisher=Verso|isbn=1859841082|last2=Martin|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper was already readily available in Europe by the late 14th century.&lt;ref name=books /&gt; While forms of moveable type of printing press had been already used in China and Korea, the technique was singularly successful in Europe given the small number of characters of the [[Latin alphabet]], massively reducing costs of book production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Print and perish?|first=Joerg|last=Heber|journal=Nature Materials|volume=7|year=2008|issue=7|pages=512–4|doi=10.1038/nmat2215|pmid=18574475|bibcode=2008NatMa...7..512H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of the technology across the continent at dazzling speed for the remaining part of the 15th century would usher a revolution and by 1500 over 200 cities in Europe had presses that printed between 8 and 20&amp;nbsp;million books.&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_y3w4cQmq8C&amp;pg=PA165|page=165|title=The Body in History: Europe from the Palaeolithic to the Futur|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2013|first1=John|last1=Robb|last2=Harris|first2=Oliver J.|isbn=9780521195287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homicide rates plunge over 800 years====
At the local level, levels of violence were extremely high by modern standards in medieval and early modern Europe. Typically, small groups would battle their neighbors, using the farm tools at hand such as knives, sickles, hammers and axes. Mayhem and death were deliberate. The vast majority of people lived in rural areas. Cities were few, and small in size, but their concentration of population was conducive to violence. Long-term studies of places such as Amsterdam, Stockholm, Venice and Zurich show the same trends as rural areas. Across Europe, [[homicide]] trends (not including military actions) show a steady long-term decline.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Eisner, "Long-term historical trends in violent crime." ''Crime and Justice'' 30 (2003): 83–142.  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manuel_Eisner/publication/279936907_Long-Term_Historical_Trends_in_Violent_Crime/links/00b4952cdb00389a86000000/Long-Term-Historical-Trends-in-Violent-Crime.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone,  "Interpersonal Violence in English Society, 1300–
1980" ''Past and Present'' (1983). 101:22–33. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650668 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Regional differences were small, except that Italy's decline was later and slower. From approximately 1200 AD through 1800 AD, homicide rates from violent local episodes declined by a factor of ten, from approximately 32 deaths per 100 000 people to 3.2 per 100 000. In the 20th century the homicide rate fell to 1.4 per 100 000. Police forces seldom existed outside the cities; prisons only became common after 1800. Before then harsh penalties were imposed for homicide (severe whipping or execution) but they proved ineffective at controlling or reducing the insults to honor that precipitated most of the violence. The decline does not correlate with economics. Most historians attribute the trend in homicides to a steady increase in self-control of the sort promoted by Protestantism, and necessitated by schools and factories.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, pp 127–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Thome, "Explaining long term trends in violent crime."

==Early Modern Europe==
{{Main|Early modern Europe|Scientific revolution|International relations, 1648–1814}}

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]]]

The Early Modern period spans the centuries between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], roughly from 1500 to 1800, or from the discovery of the New World in 1492 to the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. The period is characterised by the rise to importance of science and increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], secularised civic politics and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church. The period includes the [[Renaissance]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[European colonisation of the Americas]] and the [[European witch-hunts]].

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance}}
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', the founder of accounting, by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]

Despite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] led to the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and [[middle Europe]] during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry.

The Italian [[Petrarch]] (Francesco Petrarca), deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: "I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time." He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild. [[Matteo Palmieri]] wrote in the 1430s: "Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age." The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.

The Renaissance was inspired by the growth in the study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance – a rebirth of civilization itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Nisbet|title=History of the Idea of Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDRWfZ9Ydw0C&amp;pg=PA103|year=1980|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=103|isbn=978-1-4128-2548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important political precedents were also set in this period. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s political writing in ''[[The Prince]]'' influenced later absolutism and realpolitik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.

In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and through novel approaches to thought – the immediate past being too "Gothic" in language, thought and sensibility.

===Exploration and trade===
{{Main|Age of Discovery}}
[[File:Cantino planisphere (1502).jpg|thumb|[[Cantino planisphere]], 1502, earliest chart showing explorations by [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]]]]

Toward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the [[Ottoman Empire]], culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus' travel to the Americas in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]]'s circumnavigation of [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and Africa in 1498.

The numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, [[Portugal]] led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search of a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century, dividing their exploration of the world according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |title=kwabs.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215021/http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first states to set up colonies in America and European [[factory (trading post)|trading posts (factories)]] along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered two major [[Tatar]] khanates, the [[Khanate of Kazan]] and the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. The [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar [[Siberian Khanate]] into Russia, and the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of [[Siberia]], steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries. Oceanic explorations soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606&lt;ref&gt;MacKnight, CC (1976).

===Reformation===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}
[[File:95Thesen.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of German monk [[Martin Luther]], which criticized the Catholic Church]]
[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|left|thumb|350px|Map of Europe in 1648]]

With the development of the [[printing press]], new ideas spread throughout Europe and challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. The most common dating of the Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Euan Cameron, ''The European Reformation'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the Protestant Reformation. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than [[Martin Luther]] began to emerge as well like [[John Calvin]] whose [[Calvinism]] had influence in many countries and King [[Henry VIII of England]] who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the [[Anglican Church]]; his daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] finished the organization of the church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralized and powerful.

The Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the [[Counter-Reformation]], which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the [[Jesuits]], who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland, and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of [[Saint Philip Neri]], who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the church institutions within their kingdoms.

Unlike many European countries, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Hungary were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism, they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided among Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.

[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Europa regina]], 1570 print by [[Sebastian Münster]] of [[Basel]]]]

Another development was the idea of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilization was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: Discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilized; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. [[Francis Bacon]] and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the [[New Monarchs]] who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.

===Mercantilism and colonial expansion===
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|left|Animated map showing the evolution of [[Colonial empire]]s from 1492 to the present]]

The [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] states (Spain and Portugal) were able to dominate colonial activity in the 16th century. The Portuguese forged the first global empire in the 15th and 16th century, whilst during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the Spanish under the crown of Castile became the most powerful global empire in the world. This dominance was increasingly challenged by [[British colonisation of the Americas|British]], [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]], and the short-lived [[New Netherland|Dutch]] and [[New Sweden|Swedish]] colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries. New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of [[Federalism|government]], [[Constitutionalism|law]] and economics necessary.

Colonial expansion continued in the following centuries (with some setbacks, such as successful wars of independence in the [[American Revolution|British American colonies]] and then later [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]], [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico]], [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentina]], [[Brazilian Independence|Brazil]], and [[Latin American wars of independence|others]] amid European turmoil of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the [[Philippines]]; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India (nearly all of which was lost to Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|in 1763]]), [[French Indochina|Indochina]], large parts of Africa and the Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the [[Indies|East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.{{fact|date=June 2021}}

This expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. [[Mercantilism|Trade]] flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest in the Americas |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028035130/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/Spain.html |archive-date=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert S, Klein, ''The American Finances of the Spanish Empire : Royal Income and Expenditures in Colonial Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia, 1680-1809'' (1998) p. 92 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herbert-Klein/publication/319175990_The_American_Finances_of_the_Spanish_Empire_1680-1809/links/5997235445851564431d0934/The-American-Finances-of-the-Spanish-Empire-1680-1809.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French colonial empire|French colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]] was one of richest European colonies in the 18th century, operating on a [[plantation economy]] fueled by [[Slavery in Haiti|slave labor]].

The 17th century was an era of crisis.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M. Smith, eds. 1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M.

Wilson, ''The Thirty Years' War: Europe's Tragedy'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1640s in particular saw more state breakdowns around the world than any previous or subsequent period.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M. Smith, eds. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trevor Aston 1965"/&gt; The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the world's first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe – for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker, a British historian, suggests that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially global cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, "Crisis and Catastrophe: The Global Crisis of the Seventeenth Century Reconsidered," ''American Historical Review'' (2008) 113#4 pp. 1053–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Shank, "Crisis: A Useful Category of Post-Social Scientific Historical Analysis?" ''American Historical Review'' (2008) 113#4 pp. 1090–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Absolutism===
{{further|Political absolutism|International relations, 1648–1814}}
[[File:Mária Terézia koronázása a Szent Márton székesegyházban.jpg|thumb|Maria Theresa being crowned Queen of Hungary in the [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Bratislava|St. Martin's Cathedral]], Pressburg ([[Bratislava]])]]

The "absolute" rule of powerful monarchs such as [[Louis XIV]] (ruled France 1643–1715),&lt;ref&gt;John B. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter the Great]] (ruled Russia 1682–1725),&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey Hughes, ''Russia in the Age of Peter the Great'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Theresa]] (ruled [[Habsburg lands]] 1740–1780) and [[Frederick the Great]] (ruled Prussia 1740–86),&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Gooch, ''Frederick the Great: The Ruler, the Writer, the Man'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; produced powerful centralized states, with strong armies and powerful bureaucracies, all under the control of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Max Beloff, ''The age of absolutism, 1660–1815'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early part of this period, capitalism (through mercantilism) was replacing feudalism as the principal form of economic organisation, at least in the western half of Europe. The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a [[Commercial Revolution]]. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the [[Industrial Revolution]] after 1750.

The Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], which ended in the triumph of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon Dynasty]]. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under Elizabeth I to a moderate [[Anglicanism]]. Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is notable in this time for its [[religious tolerance|religious indifference]] and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.

====Thirty Years' War 1618–1648====
The [[Thirty Years' War]] was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighbouring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in [[Bohemia]], it quickly developed into a general war involving Catholics versus Protestants for the most part. The major impact of the war, in which mercenary armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and disease, and the breakup of family life, devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the [[Low Countries]], the [[Crown of Bohemia]] and northern parts of Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from disease and starvation, as well as postponed births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 649855|title = The Economic and Social Consequences of the Thirty Years' War|journal = Past &amp; Present|volume = 39|issue = 39|pages = 44–61|last1 = Kamen|first1 = Henry|year = 1968|doi = 10.1093/past/39.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herman Moll Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Europe's borders were still stable in 1708]]
After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance, [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the [[English Civil War]] and particularly the [[Glorious Revolution]]. European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest, [[the Enlightenment]] gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the [[printing press]], created new secular forces in thought.

[[File:Map of Europe in 1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Map of Europe in [[1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres|1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World]]]]
From the Union of Krewo (see above) central and eastern Europe was dominated by [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries Central and Eastern Europe was an arena of conflict for domination of the continent between [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (involved in series of wars, like [[Khmelnytsky uprising]], [[Russo-Polish War (1654–67)|Russo-Polish War]], the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], etc.) and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies: Russia, Prussia and Austria (the Habsburg Monarchy). By the turn of the 19th century they had become new powers, having [[Partitions of Poland|divided Poland]] between themselves, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation.

====War of the Spanish Succession====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1715) was a major war with France opposed by a coalition of England, the Netherlands, the Habsburg Monarchy, and Prussia. [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] commanded the English and Dutch victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704. The main issue was whether France under King Louis XIV would take control of Spain's very extensive possessions and thereby become by far the dominant power, or be forced to share power with other major nations. After initial allied successes, the long war produced a military stalemate and ended with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was based on a balance of power in Europe. Historian [[Russell Weigley]] argues that the many wars almost never accomplished more than they cost.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Weigley,  ''The Age of Battles: The Quest for Decisive Warfare from Breitenfeld to Waterloo'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:
:That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large – the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Trevelyan, ''A shortened history of England'' (1942) p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prussia====
[[Frederick the Great]], king of Prussia 1740–86, modernized the [[Prussian army]], introduced new tactical and strategic concepts, fought mostly successful wars ([[Silesian Wars]], Seven Years' War) and doubled the size of Prussia. Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he fought total wars for limited objectives. The goal was to convince rival kings that it was better to negotiate and make peace than to fight him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul M. Kennedy, ed.|title=Grand Strategies in War and Peace|url=https://archive.org/details/grandstrategiesi00paul|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Yale UP|page=[https://archive.org/details/grandstrategiesi00paul/page/106 106]|isbn=978-0-300-05666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis E. Showalter, ''The Wars of Frederick the Great'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
Russia with its numerous wars and rapid expansion (mainly toward east – i.e. [[Siberia]], [[Russian Far East|Far East]] – and south, to the "warm seas") was in a continuous state of financial crisis, which it covered by borrowing from Amsterdam and issuing paper money that caused inflation. Russia boasted a [[Imperial Russian Army|large and powerful army]], a very large and complex internal bureaucracy, and a splendid court that rivaled Paris and London. However the government was living far beyond its means and seized [[Russian Orthodox Church|Church]] lands, leaving organized religion in a weak condition. Throughout the 18th century Russia remained "a poor, backward, overwhelmingly agricultural, and illiterate country."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (4th ed. 1984), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
The ''Enlightenment'' was a powerful, widespread cultural movement of intellectuals beginning in late 17th-century Europe emphasizing the power of [[reason]] rather than tradition; it was especially favourable to science (especially Isaac Newton's physics) and hostile to religious orthodoxy (especially of the Catholic Church).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C.C. Jacob, ''The Enlightenment: A Brief History with Documents'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It sought to analyze and reform society using reason, to challenge ideas grounded in tradition and faith, and to advance knowledge through the [[scientific method]]. It promoted scientific thought, skepticism, and intellectual interchange.&lt;ref name="Alan Charles Kors 2003"&gt;Alan Charles Kors, ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (Oxford UP, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlightenment was a revolution in human thought. This new way of thinking was that rational thought begins with clearly stated principles, uses correct logic to arrive at conclusions, tests the conclusions against evidence, and then revises the principles in light of the evidence.&lt;ref name="Alan Charles Kors 2003"/&gt;

Enlightenment thinkers opposed superstition. Some Enlightenment thinkers collaborated with [[Enlightened absolutism|Enlightened despots]], absolutist rulers who attempted to forcibly impose some of the new ideas about government into practice. The ideas of the Enlightenment exerted significant influence on the culture, politics, and governments of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bruun, ''The enlightened despots'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating in the 17th century, it was sparked by philosophers [[Francis Bacon]] (1562–1626), [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677), [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706), [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] (1694–1746), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) and physicist [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727).&lt;ref&gt;Sootin, Harry. "Isaac Newton." New York, Messner (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered these figures and even attempted to apply their ideas of government in what was known as [[enlightened absolutism]]. The [[Scientific Revolution]] is closely tied to the Enlightenment, as its discoveries overturned many traditional concepts and introduced new perspectives on nature and man's place within it. The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790–1800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to [[Romanticism]], which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] began to increase in prominence. The Romantics argued that the Enlightenment was [[reductionistic]] insofar as it had largely ignored the forces of imagination, mystery, and sentiment.&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casey |first=Christopher |date=30 October 2008 |title="Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism |work=Foundations.

In France, Enlightenment was based in the [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–72) edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) and (until 1759) [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1717–1783) with contributions by hundreds of leading intellectuals who were called ''[[philosophes]]''&lt;!-- "philosophes" is correct --&gt;, notably [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] (1712–1778) and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). Some 25,000 copies of the 35 volume encyclopedia were sold, half of them outside France. These new intellectual strains would spread to urban centres across Europe, notably England, Scotland, the German states, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Italy, Austria, and Spain, as well as [[Thirteen colonies|Britain's American colonies.]]

The political ideals of the Enlightenment influenced the [[American Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Bill of Rights]], the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], and the Polish–Lithuanian [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a long-term historical perspective, Norman Davies has argued that [[Freemasonry]] was a powerful force on behalf of Liberalism and Enlightenment ideas in Europe, from about 1700 to the 20th century. It expanded rapidly during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], reaching practically every country in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A History|url=https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=[https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0/page/633 633]–34|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent members included [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[George Washington]]. Steven C. Bullock notes that in the late 18th century, English lodges were headed by the Prince of Wales, Prussian lodges by king [[Frederick the Great]], and French lodges by royal princes. Emperor Napoleon selected as Grand Master of France his own brother.&lt;ref&gt;Steven C.  Bullock,  "Initiating the enlightenment?: recent scholarship on European freemasonry." ''Eighteenth-Century Life'' 20#1 (1996): 80–92. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/10377/summary online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The great enemy of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Austria, Spain and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between supporters of the Church versus active Masons.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (East European Monographs, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and politics in eighteenth-century Europe'' (Oxford UP, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century [[totalitarian]] and revolutionary movements, especially the [[Fascism|Fascist]]s and [[Communism|Communist]]s, crushed the Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Art DeHoyos and S.

The "[[The long 19th century|long 19th century]]", from 1789 to 1914 saw the drastic social, political and economic changes initiated by the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Following the reorganisation of the political map of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Europe experienced the rise of Nationalism, the rise of the [[Russian Empire]] and the peak of the British Empire, as well as the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]]. Finally, the rise of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] initiated the course of events that culminated in the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

===Industrial Revolution===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Dore London.jpg|thumb|London's chimney sky in 1870, by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
The Industrial Revolution was a period in the late 18th century and early 19th century when major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transport impacted Britain and subsequently spread to the United States and Western Europe, a process that continues as industrialisation. Technological advancements, most notably the utilization of the steam engine, were major catalysts in the industrialisation process. It started in England and Scotland in the mid-18th century with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads and railways. The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Business and Economics.

The impact of this change on society was enormous.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Brown, Lester.

===Era of the French Revolution===
{{Main|American Revolution|French Revolution|Napoleonic Wars}}
Historians [[R.R. Palmer]] and [[Joel Colton]] argue:
:In 1789 France fell into revolution, and the world has never since been the same. The French Revolution was by far the most momentous upheaval of the whole revolutionary age. It replaced the "old regime" with "modern society," and at its extreme phase became very radical, so much so that all later revolutionary movements have looked back to it as a predecessor to themselves.... From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, A History of the Modern World (5th ed. 1978), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The era of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars was a difficult time for monarchs. Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]] was assassinated; King [[Louis XVI of France]] was executed, as was his queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Furthermore, kings [[Charles IV of Spain]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] and [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] were deposed as were ultimately the Emperor Napoleon and all of the relatives he had installed on various European thrones. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II of Austria]] barely clung to their thrones. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]] lost the better part of the First British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Englund, ''Napoleon: A Political Life'' (2004) p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783) was the first successful revolt of a colony against a European power. It proclaimed, in the words of [[Thomas Jefferson]], that "all men are created equal," a position based on the principles of the Enlightenment. It rejected aristocracy and established a [[Republicanism|republican form of government]] under [[George Washington]] that attracted worldwide attention.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The radicalism of the American Revolution'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Revolution (1789–1804) was a product of the same democratic forces in the [[Atlantic World]] and had an even greater impact.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800: The Challenge'' (1959) pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Victor Alphonse Aulard|French historian François Aulard]] says:
:From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Aulard in Arthur Tilley, ed.|title= Modern France. A Companion to French Studies|url=https://archive.org/details/modernfrancecomp00tilluoft|year=1922|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernfrancecomp00tilluoft/page/115 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right|The storming of the [[Bastille]] in the French Revolution of 1789]]

French intervention in the [[American Revolutionary War]] had nearly bankrupted the state. After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, King Louis XVI had to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and swore an [[Tennis Court Oath|oath]] not to dissolve until France had a constitution and created, in July, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the [[Bastille]] prison on 14 July 1789.

At the time the assembly wanted to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], and over the following two years passed various laws including the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], and a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|fundamental change]] in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people. As anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king tried to flee and join France's enemies. He was captured and on 21 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was guillotined.

On 20 September 1792 the [[National Convention]] abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]], the National Convention created the [[Committee of Public Safety]], controlled by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] of the [[Jacobin Club]], to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the [[Reign of Terror]], during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example [[Madame Roland]] and [[Georges Danton]]. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary [[war in the Vendée|insurrections]] were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the [[Thermidorian Reaction|coup of 9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.

===Napoleon===
{{Main|Napoleon}}
[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was one of the world's most famous soldiers and statesmen, leading France to great victories over numerous European enemies. Despite modest origins he became [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] and restructured much of European diplomacy, politics and law, until he was forced to abdicate in 1814. His 100-day comeback in 1815 failed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he died in exile on a remote island, remembered as a great hero by many Frenchmen and as a great villain by British and other enemies.

Napoleon, despite his youth, was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of Italy and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November) he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself [[First French Empire|Emperor]]. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ([[Third Coalition]]), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]) and dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, a [[Fourth Coalition]] was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] divided Europe between France and Russia and created the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

[[File:Berezyna.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's army at the retreat from Russia at the [[Berezina]] river]]
&lt;!--[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|left|thumb|''[[The Battle of Waterloo (painting)|The Battle of Waterloo]]'', where [[Napoleon]] was defeated by the Seventh Coalition in 1815]]--&gt;
On 12 June 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] with a [[Grande Armée]] of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by [[Cossacks]], and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a [[Sixth Coalition|seven nation army]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the [[Six Days' Campaign]] and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (see [[Hundred Days]]), raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815 and exiled to a small British island in the South Atlantic.

====Impact of the French Revolution====
{{main|Influence of the French Revolution}}
Roberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4 million deaths (of whom 1&amp;nbsp;million were civilians); 1.4&amp;nbsp;million were French deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, "Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,'" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, "meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, "Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great," ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]] and made Jews equal to everyone else. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton,  ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, "Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great," ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 341–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789–1815: France Against Europe'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon conquered most of Italy in the name of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small [[Ligurian Republic]] around Genoa. The [[Parthenopean Republic|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp. 62–65, 78–79, 88–96, 115–17, 154–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:
:For nearly two decades the Italians had excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814–1832 '' (1934) pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:
:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp. 187–88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789–1799'' (1934) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized – new names were given, "left" and "right" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.

British historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was "an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler".&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings,  "Everything Is Owed to Glory," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232?tesla=y&amp;mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl&amp;mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB12003192308051073864504580228211018002950.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl ''Wall Street Journal '' 31 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Christianity in the 19th century}}
By the 19th century, governments increasingly took over traditional religious roles, paying much more attention to efficiency and uniformity than to religiosity. Secular bodies took control of education away from the churches, abolished taxes and tithes for the support of established religions, and excluded bishops from the upper houses. Secular laws increasingly regulated marriage and divorce, and maintaining birth and death registers became the duty of local officials. Although the numerous religious denominations in the United States founded many colleges and universities, that was almost exclusively a state function across Europe.  Imperial powers protected Christian missionaries in African and Asian colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Harvey Robinson]] and [[Charles A. Beard]], ‘’The Development of Modern Europe Volume II The Merging of European into World History’’ (1930) v. 2 pp 88–89. [https://archive.org/details/developmentofmod007381mbp online]&lt;/ref&gt; In France and other largely Catholic nations, anti-clerical political movements tried to reduce the role of the Catholic Church. Likewise briefly in Germany in the 1870s there was a fierce [[Kulturkampf]] (culture war) against Catholics, but the Catholics successfully fought back. The Catholic Church concentrated more power in the papacy and fought against secularism and socialism. It sponsored devotional reforms that gained wide support among the churchgoers.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, Volume I: The Nineteenth Century in Europe:  Background and the Roman Catholic Phase''  (1958) pp. 321–23, 370, 458–59, 464–66.&lt;/ref&gt;
====Protestantism====
Historian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] argues that the outlook for Protestantism at the start of the 19th century was discouraging. It was a regional religion based in northwestern Europe, with an outpost in the sparsely settled United States. It was closely allied with government, as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Prussia, and especially Great Britain. The alliance came at the expense of independence, as the government made the basic policy decisions, down to such details as the salaries of ministers and location of new churches. The dominant intellectual currents of the Enlightenment promoted rationalism, and most Protestant leaders preached a sort of deism. Intellectually, the new methods of historical and anthropological study undermine automatic acceptance of biblical stories, as did the sciences of geology and biology. Industrialization was a strongly negative factor, as workers who moved to the city seldom joined churches. The gap between the church and the unchurched grew rapidly, and secular forces, based both in socialism and liberalism undermine the prestige of religion. Despite the negative forces, Protestantism demonstrated a striking vitality by 1900. Shrugging off Enlightenment rationalism, Protestants embraced [[romanticism]], with the stress on the personal and the invisible. Entirely fresh ideas as expressed by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Albrecht Ritschl]] and [[Adolf von Harnack]] restored the intellectual power of theology. There was more attention to historic creeds such as the Augsburg, the Heidelberg, and the Westminster confessions. In England, Anglicans emphasize the historically Catholic components of their heritage, as the High Church element reintroduced vestments and incense into their rituals. The stirrings of [[pietism]] on the Continent, and [[evangelicalism]] in Britain expanded enormously, leading the devout away from an emphasis on formality and ritual and toward an inner sensibility toward personal relationship to Christ. Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service. Above all, worldwide missionary activity became a highly prized goal, proving quite successful in close cooperation with European colonialists, particularly during the [[New Imperialism]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches'' (1959) pp. 428–31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emerging nationalism====
{{further|Nationalism}}
The political development of nationalism and the push for [[popular sovereignty]] culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe. During the 19th century nationalism became one of the most significant political and social forces in history; it is typically listed among the top causes of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Horne|title=A Companion to World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=21–22|isbn=978-1-119-96870-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette,  "Why Did They Fight the Great War? A Multi-Level Class Analysis of the Causes of the First World War." ''The History Teacher'' 40.1 (2006): 45–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's conquests of the German and Italian states around 1800–1806 played a major role in stimulating nationalism and the demands for national unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1875877|title = Napoleon and the Age of Nationalism|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 22|issue = 1|pages = 21–37|last1 = Kohn|first1 = Hans|year = 1950|doi = 10.1086/237315|s2cid = 3270766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
In the German states east of Prussia Napoleon abolished many of the old or medieval relics, such as dissolving the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Forrest and Peter H. Wilson, eds. ''The Bee and the Eagle: Napoleonic France and the End of the Holy Roman Empire'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He imposed rational legal systems and demonstrated how dramatic changes were possible. For example, his organization of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] in 1806 promoted a feeling of nationalism. Nationalists sought to encompass masculinity in their quest for strength and unity.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Hagemann,  "Of 'manly valor' and 'German Honor': nation, war, and masculinity in the age of the Prussian uprising against Napoleon." ''Central European History'' 30#2 (1997): 187–220.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s it was Prussian chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] who achieved German unification in 1870 after the many smaller states followed Prussia's leadership in wars against Denmark, Austria and France.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen Schulze, ''The Course of German Nationalism: From Frederick the Great to Bismarck 1763–1867'' (Cambridge UP, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Italian nationalism emerged in the 19th century and was the driving force for [[Italian unification]] or the "Risorgimento" (meaning the Resurgence or revival). It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to both Italian nationalism and Italian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Missolonghi.jpg|thumb|Beginning in 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] began as a rebellion by Greek revolutionaries against the ruling Ottoman Empire.]]
====Serbia====
{{main|History of Serbia}}
[[File:Breakup of Yugoslavia-TRY2.gif|thumb|250px|Breakup of Yugoslavia]]

For centuries the Orthodox Christian Serbs were ruled by the [[Muslim]]-controlled Ottoman Empire. The success of the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804–1817) against [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]] in 1817 marked the foundation of modern [[Principality of Serbia]]. It achieved ''de facto'' independence in 1867 and finally gained recognition by the Great Powers in the [[Berlin Congress]] of 1878. The Serbs developed a larger vision for nationalism in [[Pan-Slavism]] and with Russian support sought to pull the other Slavs out of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2142012|title = Pan-Slavism and European Politics|journal = Political Science Quarterly|volume = 29|issue = 4|pages = 664–686|last1 = Levine|first1 = Louis|year = 1914|doi = 10.2307/2142012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Jelavich, ''Tsarist Russia and Balkan nationalism: Russian influence in the internal affairs of Bulgaria and Serbia, 1879–1886'' (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Austria, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914 but Russia intervened, thus igniting the [[First World War]] in which Austria dissolved into nation states.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the region of [[Vojvodina]] proclaimed its [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja|secession]] from Austria-Hungary to unite with the pan-Slavic [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union on 1 December 1918, and the country was named [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. It was renamed [[Yugoslavia]], which was never able to tame the multiple nationalities and religions and it flew apart in civil war in the 1990s.

====Greece====
{{main|Greek War of Independence}}
The Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain. France, Russia and Britain intervened to make this nationalist dream become reality with the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821-1829/1830).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alister E. McGrath|title=Christian History: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIFfXCyAYmoC&amp;pg=PT270|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-33783-7|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
{{main|Bulgarian National Revival|National awakening of Bulgaria}}
[[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] modern [[nationalism]] emerged under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]] in the late 18th and early 19th century, under the influence of western ideas such as liberalism and nationalism, which trickled into the country after the French revolution, mostly via Greece, although there were stirrings in the 18th century. Russia, as a World [[Great Power]] of fellow [[Eastern Orthodox Slavs|Orthodox Slavs]], could appeal to the [[Bulgarians]] in a way that Austria could not. An autonomous [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] was established in 1870/1872 for the diocese of Bulgaria as well as for those, wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it. The [[April Uprising of 1876|April Uprising]] in 1876 indirectly resulted in the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878]].

====Poland====
{{main|History of Poland}}
The cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918. In the 1790s, Germany, Russia and Austria [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar as King of Poland. Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863–64]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to Russify the Polish language, culture and religion. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to reestablish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the Kulturkampf of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871–1900)'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
An important component of nationalism was the study of the nation's heritage, emphasizing the national language and literary culture. This stimulated, and was in turn strongly supported by, the emergence of national educational systems reaching the general population. Latin gave way to the national language, and compulsory education, with strong support from modernizers and the media, became standard in Germany and eventually the other West European nations. Voting reforms extended the franchise to the previously excluded elements. A strong sentiment among the elites was the necessity for compulsory public education, so that the new electorate could understand and handle its duties. Every country developed a sense of national origins – the historical accuracy was less important than the motivation toward patriotism. Universal compulsory education was extended as well to girls, at least at the elementary level. By the 1890s, strong movements emerged in some countries, including France, Germany and the United States, to extend compulsory education to the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellwood Patterson Cubberley|title=The History of Education: Educational Practice and Progress Considered as a Phase of the Development and Spread of Western Civilization|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|url=https://archive.org/details/historyeducatio02cubbgoog|year=1920|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyeducatio02cubbgoog/page/n742 711]–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Bowen, ''A history of western education: The modern west'' (1981) [https://archive.org/details/historyofwestern0000bowe_h0l6/page/n5/mode/2up online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideological coalitions====
[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mikhail Bakunin]] speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] at the [[Basel Congress (1869)|Basel Congress]] in 1869]]
After the defeat of revolutionary France, the great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], the major powers of Europe managed to produce a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] among the various European empires. This was known as the [[Metternich]] system. The powerbase of their support was the aristocracy, with its great landed wealth and control of the government, the church, and the military in most countries.&lt;ref&gt; Henry Kissinger, ''A world restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the problems of peace, 1812-22'' (1957) &lt;/ref&gt; However, their reactionary efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, and the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought important economical and social changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Viereck|title=Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXxHHXwJT28C&amp;pg=PA71|year=1978|pages=71–77|isbn=978-1-4128-2026-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical intellectuals looked to the working classes for a base for socialist, communist and [[anarchism|anarchistic]] ideas. Widely influential was the 1848 pamphlet by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Sperber|title=The European Revolutions, 1848—1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRuHT71EZDwC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2005|pages=86–88|isbn=978-0-521-83907-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle classes and businessmen promoted liberalism, free trade and capitalism. Aristocratic elements concentrated in government service, the military and the established churches. Nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere) called upon the "racial" unity (which usually meant a common language and an imagined common ethnicity) to seek national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Greece successfully revolted against Ottoman rule in the 1820s. European diplomats and intellectuals saw the Greek struggle for independence, with its accounts of Turkish atrocities, in a romantic light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Pilbeam|title=The Middle Classes in Europe, 1789–1914: France, Germany, Italy, and Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkZdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240|year=1990|page=240|isbn=978-1-349-20606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France under Napoleon III====
[[File:Barricade Voltaire Lenoir Commune Paris 1871.jpg|thumb|[[Paris Commune]], 1871.]]
[[Napoleon III]], nephew of Napoleon I, parlayed his famous name and to widespread popularity across France . He returned from exile in 1848, promising to stabilize the chaotic political situation.&lt;ref&gt; [[Napoleon II]] (1811–1832) was the son of Napoleon I but he never actually ruled.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected president and maneuvered successfully to name himself Emperor, a move approved later by a large majority of the French electorate. The first part of his Imperial term brought many important reforms, facilitated by Napoleon's control of the lawmaking body, the government, and the Army. Hundreds of old Republican leaders were arrested and deported. Napoleon controlled the media and censored the news. In compensation for the loss of freedom, Napoleon gave the people new hospitals and asylums, beautified and modernized Paris, and built a modern railroad and transportation system that dramatically improved commerce, and helped the many small farmers as well. The economy grew, but industrialization was not as rapid as Britain, and France depended largely on small family-oriented firms as opposed to the large companies that were emerging in the United States and Germany. France was on the winning side in the Crimean war (1854–56), but after 1858 Napoleon's foreign-policy was less and less successful. He antagonized Great Britain and failed to appreciate the danger of war with Prussia. Foreign-policy blunders finally destroyed his reign in 1870–71. He gained worldwide attention for his aggressive foreign policy in Europe, Mexico, and worldwide. He helped in the unification of Italy by fighting the Austrian Empire and joined the [[Crimean War]] on the side of Great Britain to defend the Ottoman Empire against Russia. His empire collapsed after being defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon III." in Anne Commire, ed. ''Historic World Leaders,'' (Gale, 1994) [https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/K1616000030/GPS?u=wikipedia&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=828abdad online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.P.T. Bury, ''Napoleon III and the Second Empire'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; 

France became a republic, but until the 1880s there was a strong popular demand for return to monarchy. That never happened because of the blunders made by the available monarchs. Hostility to the Catholic Church became a major issue, as France battle between secular and religious forces well into the 20th century, with the secular elements usually more successful. The [[French Third Republic]] emerged in 1871, was on the winning side of the first world war, and was finally overthrown when it was defeated in 1940 in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Brogan, ''The French Nation: From Napoleon to Pétain, 1814–1940'' (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most European states had become [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] (rather than absolute) monarchies by 1871, and Germany and Italy merged many small city-states to become united nation-states. Germany in particular increasingly dominated the continent in terms of economics and political power. Meanwhile, on a global scale, Great Britain, with its far-flung [[British Empire]], unmatched Royal Navy, and powerful bankers, became the world's first global power. The sun never set on its territories, while an informal empire operated through British financiers, entrepreneurs, traders and engineers who established operations in many countries, and largely dominated Latin America. The British were especially famous for financing and constructing railways around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Porter and William Roger Louis, eds.

====Bismarck's Germany====

From his base in Prussia, [[Otto von Bismarck]] in the 1860s engineered a series of short, decisive wars, that [[Unification of Germany|unified most of the German states]] (excluding Austria) into a powerful [[German Empire]] under Prussian leadership. He humiliated France in the process, but kept on good terms with Austria-Hungary. With that accomplished by 1871 he then skillfully used [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] diplomacy to preserve Germany's new role and keep Europe at peace. The new [[German Empire]] industrialized rapidly and challenged Britain for economic leadership. Bismarck disliked colonies but public and elite opinion forced him to build an overseas empire. He was removed from office in 1890 by an aggressive young Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who pursued a disruptive foreign policy that polarized Europe into rival camps. These rival camps went to war with each other in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Ann Lerman,  "Bismarck, Otto von." in '' Europe 1789–1914: Encyclopedia of the Age of Industry and Empire'', edited by John Merriman and Jay Winter, (Charles Scribner's Sons, 2006) vol 1, pp. 233–242.

====Austrian and Russian empires====
{{Further|Austrian Empire|Austria-Hungary|Russian Empire}}
The power of nationalism to create new states was irresistible in the 19th century, and the process could lead to collapse in the absence of a strong nationalism. [[Austria-Hungary]] had the advantage of size, but multiple disadvantages. There were rivals on four sides, its finances were unstable, the population was fragmented into multiple ethnicities and languages that served as the bases for separatist nationalisms. It had a large army with good forts, but its industrial base was thin. Its naval resources were so minimal that it did not attempt to build an overseas empire. It did have the advantage of good diplomats, typified by [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich (Foreign Minister 1809–1848, Prime Minister, 1821–1848))]]. They employed a grand strategy for survival that balanced out different forces, set up buffer zones, and kept the Habsburg empire going despite wars with the Ottomans, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Bismarck, until the final disaster of the First World War. The Empire overnight disintegrated into multiple states based on ethnic nationalism and the principle of self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Wess Mitchell|title=The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxtEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA307|year=2018|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=307|isbn=978-1-4008-8996-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Empire]] likewise brought together a multitude of languages and cultures, so that its military defeat in the First World War led to multiple splits that created independent Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, and for a brief spell, independent Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Lieven, ''Empire: The Russian Empire and Its Rivals'' (2000) pp. 226–30, 278–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperialism===
{{Main|Colonial Empires|History of colonialism|Habsburg Monarchy|Russian Empire|French colonial empire|British Empire|Dutch Empire|Italian colonial empire|German colonial empire}}
[[File:Afrikakonferenz.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] headed by [[Otto von Bismarck]] that regulated European colonization in Africa during the [[New Imperialism]] period]]

[[Colonial empires]] were the product of the European [[Age of Discovery]] from the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the [[Renaissance]]. Both the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.

Subsequent major European colonial empires included the [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|British]] empires. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as electronic communication through the telegraph, cable, and radio. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], [[German colonial empire|Germany]], and [[Italian colonial empire|Italy]], pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller. Ignoring the oceans, Russia built its [[Russian Empire]] through conquest by land in Eastern Europe, and Asia.

By the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had declined enough to become a target for other global powers (see [[History of the Balkans]]). This instigated the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe that eventually set the stage for the [[First World War]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of Italy and Germany as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, [[Otto von Bismarck]] engineered a German hegemony of Europe that put France in a critical situation. It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides – the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) and the [[Triple Entente]] of 1907 (Britain, France and Russia) – formed in Europe, improving their military forces and alliances year-by-year.

==1914–1945: Two World wars==
[[File:1916_political_map_of_Europe.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Europe in 1916]]

German-American historian [[Konrad Jarausch]], asked if he agreed that "the European record of the past century [was] just one gigantic catastrophe", argues:
:It is true that the first half of the 20th century was full of internecine warfare, economic depression, ethnic cleansing and racist genocide that killed tens of millions of people, more than any other period in human history. But looking only at the disasters creates an incomplete perception, because the second half of the century witnessed a much more positive development in spite of the Cold War. After the defeat of Fascism in 1945, the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 also liberated the East from Communist control in a quite unexpected fashion. As a result, Europeans generally live more free, prosperous and healthy lives than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m10427.html "An Interview with Konrad H. Jarausch, author of Out of Ashes: A New History of Europe in the Twentieth Century", Princeton University Press, June 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621101906/http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m10427.html |date=21 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[short twentieth century]]", from 1914 to 1991, included the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. The First World War used modern technology to kill millions of soldiers. Victory by Britain, France, the United States and other allies drastically changed the map of Europe, ending four major land empires (the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires) and leading to the creation of nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The [[October Revolution]] in Russia led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] (1917–1991) and the rise of the international communist movement. Widespread economic prosperity was typical of the period before 1914, and 1920–1929. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, however, democracy collapsed in most of Europe. Fascists took control in Italy, and the even more aggressive Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler took control of Germany, 1933–45. The Second World War was fought on an even larger scale than the First war, killing many more people, and using even more advanced technology. It ended with the division of Europe between East and West, with the East under the control of the Soviet Union and the West dominated by NATO. The two sides engaged in the [[Cold War]], with actual conflict taking place not in Europe but in Asia in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Imperial system collapsed. The remaining [[colonial empire]]s ended through the [[decolonisation]] of European rule in Africa and Asia. The fall of Soviet Communism (1989–1991) left the West dominant and enabled the [[reunification of Germany]]. It accelerated the process of a [[European integration]] to include Eastern Europe. The European Union continues today, but with German economic dominance. Since the worldwide Great Recession of 2008, European growth has been slow, and financial crises have hit Greece and other countries. Modern-day Russia is weaker by military might, compared to when it was a superpower as a part of the Soviet Union, but has retained its historical status as both a [[great power]] and a [[regional power]], confronting Ukraine and other post-Soviet states.

===World War I===

[[File:trencheswwi2.jpg|thumb|Trenches and sand bags were defences against machine guns and artillery on the Western Front, 1914–1918]]

After the relative peace of most of the 19th century, the rivalry between European powers, compounded by a rising nationalism among ethnic groups, exploded in August 1914, when the [[First World War]] started.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bond,  "The First World War" in [[C.L. Mowat]], ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Vol. XII: The Shifting Balance of World Forces 1898–1945'' (2nd ed. 1968) [https://archive.org/stream/iB_CMH/12#page/n3/mode/1up online] pp. 171–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 65 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918; 20&amp;nbsp;million soldiers and civilians died, and 21&amp;nbsp;million were seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Clark (historian)|Christopher Clark]], ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2013) p xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; On one side were Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Bulgaria]] (the [[Central Powers]]/[[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]), while on the other side stood [[Serbia]] and the ''[[Triple Entente]]'' – the coalition of France, Britain and Russia, which were joined by Italy in 1915, Romania in 1916 and by the United States in 1917. The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Somme killed hundreds of thousands of men while leaving the stalemate unchanged. Heavy artillery and machine guns caused most of the casualties, supplemented by poison gas. Czarist Russia collapsed in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. After eight months of liberal rule, the [[October Revolution]] brought [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union in place of the disintegrated Russian Empire. With American entry into the war in 1917 on the Allied side, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower, while an average of 10,000 American troops were arriving in France every day in the summer of 1918. Germany's allies, [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], surrendered and dissolved, followed by Germany on 11 November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Overviews include David Stevenson,  ''Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy'' (2005) and Ian F. W. Beckett, ''The Great War: 1914–1918'' (2nd ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For reference see Martin Gilbert, ''Atlas of World War I'' (1995)  and Spencer Tucker, ed., ''The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The victors forced Germany to assume responsibility for the conflict and pay war reparations.

One factor in determining the outcome of the war was that the Allies had significantly more economic resources they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25 billion. Among the Allies, Britain spent $21 billion and the U.S. $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War, 1914–1918'' (1977) p. 153, using estimated made by H. Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1941) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Peace Conference===
{{main|Paris Peace Conference, 1919}}
[[File:William Orpen – The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles 1919, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|450px|Detail from [[William Orpen]]'s painting ''The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919'', showing the signing of the peace treaty by a minor German official opposite to the representatives of the winning powers.]]

The world war was settled by the victors at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Two dozen nations sent delegations, and there were many nongovernmental groups, but the defeated powers were not invited.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Macmillan, [[Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War]] (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" were President [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States, Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] of Great Britain, [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France, and, of least importance, Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Orlando]].  Each has a large staff of experts. They met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by the others.&lt;ref&gt;by Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1958) p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

The major decisions were the creation of the [[League of Nations]]; the six peace treaties with defeated enemies, most notable the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as [[League of Nations mandate|"mandates"]], chiefly to Britain and France; and the drawing of new national boundaries (sometimes with plebiscites) to better reflect the forces of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918–1933'' (2nd ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zara Steiner, ''The Lights that Failed: European International History 1919–1933'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Four implemented sweeping changes to the [[political geography]] of the world. Most famously, the Treaty of Versailles itself weakened [[Reichswehr|Germany's military power]] and placed [[War Guilt Clause|full blame for the war]] and [[World War I reparations|costly reparations]] on its shoulders – the humiliation and resentment in Germany was probably one of the causes of Nazi success and indirectly a [[causes of World War II|cause of World War II]].

At the insistence of President Wilson, the Big Four required Poland to sign a treaty on 28 June 1919 that guaranteed [[minority rights]] in the new nation. Poland signed under protest, and made little effort to enforce the specified rights for Germans, Jews, [[Ukrainians]], and other minorities. Similar treaties were signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and later by Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Finland and Germany were not asked to sign a [[Minority Treaties|minority rights treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Carole Fink, "The Paris Peace Conference and the Question of Minority Rights," ''Peace and Change: A journal of peace research'' (1996) 21#3 pp. 273–88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) the winners recognised the new states ([[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], Hungary, Austria, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]]) created in central Europe from the defunct German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires, based on national (ethnic) self-determination. It was a peaceful era with a few small wars before 1922 such as the [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]] (1917–1921) and the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1921). Prosperity was widespread, and the major cities sponsored a youth culture called the "[[Roaring Twenties]]" or "[[Jazz Age]]" that was often featured in the cinema, which attracted very large audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond James Sontag, . ''A broken world, 1919–1939'' (1972) [https://archive.org/details/brokenworld1919100sont online free to borrow]; wide-ranging survey of European history.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied victory in the First World War seemed to mark the triumph of [[History of Liberalism|liberalism]], not just in the Allied countries themselves, but also in Germany and in the new states of Eastern Europe, as well as Japan. Authoritarian militarism as typified by Germany had been defeated and discredited. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Atkin|author2=Michael Biddiss|title=Themes in Modern European History, 1890–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFN_AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|pages=243–44|isbn=978-1-134-22257-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new [[Communist International|communist movement]] taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution. Communist revolts were beaten back everywhere else, but they did succeed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Luebbert, ''Liberalism, fascism, or social democracy: Social classes and the political origins of regimes in interwar Europe'' (Oxford UP, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fascism and authoritarianism====
Italy adopted an authoritarian dictatorship known as [[Fascism]] in 1922; it became a model for Hitler in Germany and for right wing elements in other countries. Historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] says Fascism in Italy was:
:A primarily political dictatorship....The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience....

===Great Depression: 1929–1939===
{{main|Great Depression}}
After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], nearly the whole world sank into a [[Great Depression]], as money stopped flowing from New York to Europe, prices fell, profits fell, and unemployment soared. The worst hit sectors included heavy industry, export-oriented agriculture, mining and lumbering, and construction. World trade fell by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kindleberger, ''The World in Depression, 1929–1939'' (2nd ed. 1986) provides a broad survey by an economist,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s'' (2000)  816pp covers far more details by a political historian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism and democracy were discredited. In most of Europe, as well as in Japan and most of Latin America, nation after nation turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes. The most momentous change of government came when Hitler and his Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. The main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], created in 1919. However the League failed to resolve any major crises and by 1938 it was no longer a major player. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States. By 1937 it was largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;F.P. Walters, ''A History of the League of Nations'' (Oxford UP, 1965). [https://libraryresources.unog.ch/ld.php?content_id=31457235 online free].&lt;/ref&gt;

A major civil war took place in [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]], with the nationalists winning. The League of Nations was helpless as Italy conquered Ethiopia and Japan seized Manchuria in 1931 and took over most of China starting in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;David Clay Large, ''Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Milicianas CNT-FAI.png|thumb|200px|[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] milicia during [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Social Revolution]]]]
The [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the rebels (the Nationalists), led by [[Francisco Franco]], won in 1939. There was military intervention as Italy sent land forces, and Germany sent smaller elite air force and armoured units to the Nationalists. The Soviet Union sold armaments to the leftist Republicans on the other side, while the Communist parties in numerous countries sent soldiers to the "[[International Brigades]]." The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left, the communist movement and many liberals against Catholics, conservatives, and fascists. Britain, France and the US remained neutral and refused to sell military supplies to either side. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'' (1970) pp. 262–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{main|Causes of World War II|World War II|Diplomatic history of World War II|Home front during World War II}}
In the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938, Britain and France adopted a policy of [[appeasement]] as they gave [[Hitler]] what he wanted out of Czechoslovakia in the hope that it would bring peace. It did not. In 1939 Germany took over the rest of Czechoslovakia and appeasement policies gave way to hurried rearmament as Hitler next turned his attention to Poland.

After allying with Japan in the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and then also with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy in the "[[Pact of Steel]]", and finally signing a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression treaty]] with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Hitler launched the [[Second World War]] on 1 September 1939 by attacking Poland. To his surprise Britain and France declared war on Germany, but there was little fighting during the "Phoney War" period. War began in earnest in spring 1940 with the successful Blitzkrieg conquests of Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. Britain remained alone but refused to negotiate, and defeated Germany's air attacks in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941. Despite initial successes, the German army was stopped close to Moscow in December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;I.C.B. Dear and M.R.D. Foot, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) covers every country and major campaign.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next year the tide was turned and the Germans started to suffer a series of defeats, for example in the siege of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. Meanwhile, Japan (allied to Germany and Italy since September 1940) attacked Britain and the United States on 7 December 1941; Germany then completed its over-extension by declaring war on the United States. War raged between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] (British Empire, Soviet Union, and the United States). The Allied Forces won in North Africa, invaded Italy in 1943, and recaptured France in 1944. In the spring of 1945 Germany itself was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union and from the west by the other Allies. As the Red Army conquered the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in Berlin, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered in early May.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe, 1939–1945'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing [[World War II casualties|between 50 and 80 million deaths]], the majority of whom were civilians (approximately 38 to 55 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm |title=Second''Second Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'' |publisher=Users.erols.com |access-date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period was also marked by systematic genocide. In 1942–45, separately from the war-related deaths, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] killed an additional number of over 11 million civilians [[IBM and the Holocaust|identified through IBM-enabled censuses]], including the [[The Holocaust|majority of the Jews]] and [[Porajmos|Gypsies]] of Europe, millions of [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish]] and [[Generalplan Ost|Soviet]] Slavs, and also homosexuals, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], misfits, disabled, and political enemies. Meanwhile, in the 1930s the Soviet system of [[Gulag|forced labour]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|expulsions]] and [[Holodomor|allegedly engineered famine]] had a similar death toll. During and after the war millions of civilians were affected by forced population transfers.&lt;ref&gt;Dinah Shelton, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'' (3 vol. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War Era==
{{Main|Cold War|NATO|Marshall Plan|European Economic Community}}

[[File:DNV opona.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Remains of the "[[Iron curtain]]" in [[Devínska Nová Ves]], [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia).]]
The world wars ended the pre-eminent position of Britain, France and Germany in Europe and the world.&lt;ref&gt;John Wheeler-Bennett,  ''The Semblance Of Peace: The Political Settlement After The Second World War'' (1972) thorough diplomatic coverage 1939–1952.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Yalta Conference]], Europe was divided into spheres of influence between the victors of World War II, and soon became the principal zone of contention in the [[Cold War]] between the two power blocs, the [[Western countries]] and the [[Communist bloc]]. The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the [[NATO]] military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[East Germany]], Hungary, Poland, and Romania) in 1955 established the [[Warsaw Pact]] as a counterpoint to NATO. The Warsaw Pact had a much larger ground force, but the American-French-British nuclear umbrellas protected NATO.

[[Communist state]]s were imposed by the Red Army in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion with war and dictatorship, and the promise of continued economic prosperity. Martin Conway also adds that an important impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conway, "The Rise and Fall of Western Europe's Democratic Age, 1945––1973," ''Contemporary European History'' (2004) 13#1 pp. 67–88.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Economic recovery===
{{Main|Marshall Plan|European Economic Community}}
The United States gave away about $20&amp;nbsp;billion in [[Marshall Plan]] grants and other grants and low-interest long-term loans to Western Europe, 1945 to 1951. Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states. Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government. In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against The possibility of a Communist invasion or political takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947–1952'' (1989)  pp. 26–28, 430–43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States. Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, " History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program." They state:
:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II "mixed economies" with more "market" and less "controls" in the mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. Bradford |last1=DeLong |first2=Barry |last2=Eichengreen |chapter=The Marshall Plan: History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program |title=Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today |editor-first=Rudiger |editor-last=Dornbusch |editor2-first=Wilhelm |editor2-last=Nolling |editor3-first=Richard |editor3-last=Layard |publisher=MIT Press |year=1993 |pages=189–230 |isbn=978-0-262-04136-2 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGCfmmlGtPEC&amp;pg=PA189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marshall Plan.png|left|thumb|upright=1.6|Marshall Plan dollar amounts]]

The Soviet Union concentrated on its own recovery. It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:
:The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kramer, "The Soviet Bloc and the Cold War in Europe," {{cite book|author=Klaus Larresm ed.|title=A Companion to Europe Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyNcCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT174|year=2014|publisher=Wiley|page=79|isbn=978-1-118-89024-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Europe began economic and then political integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which grew and evolved into the [[European Union]], and the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[Solidarność]] movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 after the [[Pan-European Picnic]] the [[Iron Curtain]] and the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|ending the USSR]], which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The most violent dissolution happened in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans. Four ([[Slovenia]], Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[North Macedonia]]) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post–Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.

Looking at the half century after the war historian [[Walter Laqueur|Walter Lacquer]] concluded:
:"The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values – or so it appeared at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, "The Slow Death of Europe", ''The National Interest'' [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-the-euro-the-least-europes-worries-5767 16 August 2011 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war period also witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class. As noted by one historical text, "within a single generation, the working classes of Western Europe came to enjoy the multiple pleasures of the consumer society."&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Is There Still a West?: The Future of the Atlantic Alliance|author1=Hay, W.A.|author2=Sicherman, H.|date=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press, Queen Elizabeth also had a major breakdown causing her to die cause of the stress overload.|isbn=978-0-8262-6549-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwDQ3jAGMX0C|page=107|access-date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Europe's industrial nations in the 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations at the time of her death in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;David Priestland, "Margaret Thatcher?" ‘’BBC History Magazine’’ 1 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.182|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the Cold War]]
The end of the Cold War came in a series of events from 1979 to 1991, mainly in Eastern Europe. In the end, these brought the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], the [[German reunification]] and the end of Soviet control over their Eastern European satellites and their worldwide network of communist parties in a friendly chain reaction from the [[Pan-European Picnic]] in 1989. The finals brought the division of the Soviet Union into 15 non-communist states in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Rödder: Deutschland einig Vaterland – Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,:
:The systemic and ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism had faded away. The geopolitical partition of Europe was no more. Nuclear deterrence was morphing into a less armed, almost hypothetical version of its previous self. Superpower rivalry was rapidly wound up with cascading effects in various areas of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Romero, "Cold War historiography at the crossroads", ''Cold War History'' (2014), 14:4, 685–703, {{doi|10.1080/14682745.2014.950249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the Cold War, the [[European Economic Community]] pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the [[Maastricht Treaty]] established the [[European Union]], succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic market via the [[European Economic Area]]. These countries also entered the [[Schengen Agreement]] which lifted border controls between member states.&lt;ref name="Europa History 90-99"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Europe without frontiers |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm |access-date=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maastricht Treaty created a single currency for most EU members. The ''[[euro]]'' was created in 1999 and replaced all previous currencies in participating states in 2002. The most notable exception to the currency union, or ''[[eurozone]]'', was the United Kingdom, which also did not sign the Schengen Agreement.

EU did not participate in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and was divided on supporting the United States in the 2003–2011 [[Iraq War]]. NATO has been part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], but at a much lower level of involvement than the United States.

In 2004, the EU [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|gained 10 new members]]. ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]], which had been part of the Soviet Union; [[Czech Republic]], Hungary, Poland, [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]], five former-communist countries; [[Malta]], and the divided island of [[Cyprus]].) These were followed by [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|Bulgaria and Romania in 2007]]. Russia's regime had interpreted these expansions as violations against NATO's promise to not expand "one inch to the east" in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315-2.html|title=NATO's Eastward Expansion: Calming Russian Fears |author=Spiegel Online, Hamburg|date=26 November 2009|newspaper=Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia engaged in a number of bilateral disputes about gas supplies with [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] which endangered gas supplies to Europe. Russia also engaged in a [[Russo-Georgian War|minor war with Georgia]] in 2008.

Supported by the United States and some European countries, [[Kosovo]]'s government [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from Serbia on 17 February 2008.

Public opinion in the EU turned against enlargement, partially due to what was seen as over-eager expansion including Turkey gaining candidate status. The [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] was rejected [[Referendums related to the European Union|in France and the Netherlands]], and then (as the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) in Ireland, although a second vote passed in Ireland in 2009.

The [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] [[Great Recession|affected]] Europe, and government responded with [[Anti-austerity movement|austerity measures]]. Limited [[National accounts|ability]] of the smaller EU nations (most notably [[Economy of Greece#2010–present government debt crisis|Greece]]) to handle their debts led to social unrest, government liquidation, and financial insolvency. In May 2010, the German parliament agreed to loan 22.4&amp;nbsp;billion euros to Greece over three years, with the stipulation that Greece follow strict austerity measures. See [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].

Beginning in 2014, [[Ukraine]] has been in a [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|state of revolution]] and unrest with two breakaway regions ([[Donetsk]] and [[Lugansk]]) attempting to join Russia as full [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. (''See [[War in Donbass]].'') On 16 March, a [[2014 Crimean status referendum|referendum]] was held in [[Crimea]] leading to the ''de facto'' secession of Crimea and its largely internationally unrecognized [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] to the Russian Federation as the [[Republic of Crimea]].

In June 2016, in a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum in the United Kingdom]] on the [[European Union–United Kingdom relations|country's membership in the European Union]], 52% of voters voted to leave the EU, leading to the complex [[Brexit]] separation process and negotiations, which led to [[Aftermath of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|political and economic changes]] for both the UK and the remaining European Union countries. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Later that year all of Europe was seriously affected by the outbreak of [[Covid]].
