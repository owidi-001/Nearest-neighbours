[[File:Venus and Serena 1993.jpg|thumb|left|Williams sisters at a [[Pam Shriver]] event in Baltimore, 1993]]
When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]],&lt;ref name="Serenabio" /&gt; so that she could attend the tennis academy of [[Rick Macci]]; Macci began to provide additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|title=Venus, Serena reflect as they prepare for Fed Cup|publisher=blackathlete.net|access-date=April 22, 2009|first=Michelle|last=Kaufman|date=April 22, 2007|archive-date=July 8, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708024727/http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10 since he wanted them to go slowly and to focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.&lt;ref name="Newsweek1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/1012925/venus-serena-against-world |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903121131/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/1012925/venus-serena-against-world |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 3, 2017 |title=Venus And Serena Against The World |first1=Marc |last1=Peyser |first2=Allison |last2=Samuels |date=August 24, 1998 |work=Newsweek |access-date=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the [[United States Tennis Association]] junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.&lt;ref name="EdmonsonsEarly"&gt;Edmonson, 2005, ''Venus and Serena Williams'', pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."&lt;ref name="EdmonsonsEarly" /&gt;

==Playing style==
Williams is primarily a [[Tennis strategy#Baseliner strategies|baseline player]], and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus08/news/story?id=3207822 |title=Gimpy Jankovic swats away defending champion Williams|publisher=ESPN |last= Ford|first= Bonnie D.|date=January 22, 2008|access-date=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; return of serve, and forceful [[groundstroke]]s from both her [[forehand]] and [[backhand]] swings. Her forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Open 2014: Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Sam Stosur Among Best Tennis Strokes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/sports/tennis/us-open-2014-serena-williams-maria-sharapova-and-agnieszka-radwanska-among-best-tennis-strokes.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 24, 2014|access-date=July 29, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Christopher|last=Clarey}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a "high risk" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which most say is the greatest in women's tennis history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12739719/stars-serve-praise-serena-williams-biggest-weapon |title=20 For 20: Stars Serve Up Praise of Serena Williams' Biggest Weapon |publisher=ESPN |date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-serve-returned |title=The Serve, Returned |work=The New Yorker|first=Reeves |last=Wiedeman |date=September 5, 2012 |access-date=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/gear/2011/04/gear-talk-qa-with-pam-shriver/38721/ |title=Gear Talk: Q&amp;A With Pam Shriver |website=Tennis.com |date=April 7, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Pagliaro |access-date=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She consistently projects great pace and placement with her serves; in the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of {{convert|128.6|mph|abbr=on}} which is the third fastest all-time among female players (only [[Venus Williams|Venus's]] 129{{nbsp}}mph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/1978722/title/ids-serve-speed-leaders |title=IDS Serve Speed Leaders |date=November 3, 2015 |website=[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] |access-date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sabine Lisicki]]'s 131{{nbsp}}mph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/30/sabine-lisicki-record-fastest-serve-women-tennis-stanford |title=Sabine Lisicki sets record for fastest serve in women's tennis – but loses |first=Marcin |last=Bryszak |work=The Guardian |date=July 30, 2014 |access-date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded speeds are faster).

Williams is known for producing exceptional comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level. She has won three Grand Slam singles titles after saving match points (the 2003 Australian Open semifinal versus [[Kim Clijsters]], the 2005 Australian Open semifinal versus [[Maria Sharapova]], and the 2009 Wimbledon semifinal versus [[Elena Dementieva]]), a feat achieved more often than any other player in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisplanet.me/blog/2012/06/grand-slam-champions-who-saved-match-points-from-2000-is-Djokovic-about-to-make-his-second-entry-her.html |title=Grand slam champions who saved match points (from 2000). |date=June 5, 2012 |work=Tennisplanet.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also came back from a 3–5 deficit in the third set against [[Kim Clijsters]] in the 1999 US Open en route to her first Grand Slam singles title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102987/bio|title=Serena Williams|website=IMDb|access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2012 US Open – Women's Singles|2012 US Open]] final against [[Victoria Azarenka]], she was down 3–5 in the third set and found herself two points away from losing the match.

===1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 player===
Williams lost in the third round of the [[1999 Australian Open]] to [[Sandrine Testud]]. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeated [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the final of the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris. With Venus also winning the [[Cellular South Cup|IGA Superthrift Classic]] in Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Continents Apart, Williams Sisters Make History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/01/sports/tennis-continents-apart-williams-sisters-make-history.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 22, 2009 |date=March 1, 1999 |first=Sal A.|last=Zanca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March of that year, at the [[BNP Paribas Open|Evert Cup]] in California, Williams won her first [[Tier I]] title, defeating [[Steffi Graf]] in the final.

She then defeated in succession Grand Slam champions [[Kim Clijsters]], [[Conchita Martínez]], [[Monica Seles]], and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] final, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, after [[Althea Gibson]] in 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.&lt;ref Name ="WTA profile" /&gt; The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia.

Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to [[Elena Likhovtseva]]. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win the [[Faber Grand Prix]] in Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed the [[2000 French Open|French Open]] because of injury. She returned from injury at the [[2000 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Du Maurier Open]] where an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of the [[2000 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at the [[Sydney Olympics]] that September. She ended the year winning the [[Toyota Princess Cup]] in Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International in [[Medibank International|Sydney]] and the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was the [[Pacific Life Open]] in California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family after [[Boycott of BNP Paribas Open by Venus and Serena Williams|Venus withdrew]] before their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Indian-Wells-boycott-hurts-Williamses-more-than-?urn=ten,149332 |title=Indian Wells boycott hurts Williamses more than it helps |last=Rogers |first=Martin |date=March 19, 2009 |work=Busted Racquet |publisher=Yahoo!

She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both the [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and [[2001 Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]]. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals of [[East West Bank Classic|Los Angeles]] against Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]], defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Tour Championships]], Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final due to a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===2002–2003: "Serena Slam"===
Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at the [[Medibank International Sydney]] and later withdraw from the [[2002 Australian Open|Australian Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/14/sports/tennis-agassi-and-serena-williams-withdraw-in-australia-kuerten-is-beaten.html|title=Tennis; Agassi And Serena Williams Withdraw In Australia; Kuerten Is Beaten|last=Clarey|first=Christopher|date=January 14, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:SWilliams-SYD-1.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002&lt;/div&gt;]]

Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year in [[State Farm Women's Tennis Classic|Scottsdale, Arizona]], defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the [[2002 French Open]]. Her first tournament was at [[Family Circle Cup|Charleston]], where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing to [[Patty Schnyder]]. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at the [[WTA German Open|Eurocard German Open]] losing to [[Justine Henin]] in a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Italian Open]], defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/20/tennis1 |title=Hingis may be out to end of year |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 23, 2009 |date=May 20, 2002 |first=Eleanor |last=Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy at [[Court Philippe Chatrier]], Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2002 Wimbledon Championships]], Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing in the quarterfinals of the [[JPMorgan Chase Open]] in Los Angeles to American [[Chanda Rubin]] and ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win the [[Toyota Princess Cup]] in Tokyo, and [[Anastasia Myskina]] to win the [[Sparkassen Cup (tennis)|Sparkassen Cup]] in Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-end [[WTA Tour Championships|Home Depot Championships]] at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking since [[Althea Gibson]] in 1958 {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1536384-forget-calendar-slam-surface-slam-almost-as-rare|title=Forget Calendar Slam, "Surface Slam" Almost as Rare |work=Bleacher Report|date=February 20, 2013|access-date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2003 Australian Open]], Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongside [[Margaret Court]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Steffi Graf]]. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joining [[Maureen Connolly Brinker]], Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/australian_open/2003/2693425.stm|title=Serena completes Slam |access-date=May 30, 2017|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=January 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennischannel.com/news/NewsDetails.aspx?newsid=5055 |title=Grand Slam for Serena Williams? |first=John |last=Leicester |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=Tennis Channel |access-date=April 22, 2009 |date=February 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210454/http://www.tennischannel.com/news/NewsDetails.aspx?newsid=5055 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Williams sisters]] won their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/australian_open/2003/2690067.stm|title=Williams pair take doubles crown |access-date=May 30, 2017|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=January 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at the [[Open Gaz de France]] and the [[Sony Ericsson Open]]. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of the [[Family Circle Cup]] to Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at the [[2003 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/french_open_2003/2967190.stm|title=Williams 'hurt' by jeers |access-date=May 30, 2017|work=[[BBC Sport]]

This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris |first=Beth |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2003-08-01-serena-out-us-open_x.htm |agency=Associated Press |title=Serena Williams to miss U.S. Open after knee surgery |newspaper=USA Today |date=August 2, 2003 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910034041/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2003-08-01-serena-out-us-open_x.htm |archive-date=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first at [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seeded Sharapova defeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]], where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking.

She reached the final without dropping a set, including wins over No. 5, Maria Sharapova, and No. 4, Agnieszka Radwańska, and faced first time Grand Slam finalist [[Angelique Kerber]]. She was considered the heavy favorite to win the title, as she had never lost an Australian Open final or semifinal. She also dominated the head-to-head against Kerber, having lost only once in six meetings and having not lost a set to her in four years. Williams lost the final in three sets and Kerber won her first Grand Slam title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/serena-williams-angelque-kerber-australian-open-final-tennis|title=Angelique Kerber stuns Serena Williams to clinch Australian Open title|last=Mitchell|first=Kevin|date=January 30, 2016|website=The Guardian|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked Williams's first-ever loss in the final of the Australian Open, as well as her first three-set loss in the final of a Grand Slam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/sports/angelique-kerber-upsets-serena-williams-to-win-australian-open.html|title=Angelique Kerber Upsets Serena Williams to Win Australian Open|date=January 30, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 4, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously been 6–0 and 8–0 respectively.
[[File:Williams S. WM16 (20) (28339693721).jpg|thumb|Serena at the 2016 Wimbledon, winning her 22nd Grand Slam title]]
The week of February 15 marked Williams's 157th consecutive week ranked No. 1, passing Navratilova's mark of 156 to have the second-longest run in WTA history behind Steffi Graf's 186. She competed in [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] as the No. 1 seed. She reached her first final here since winning in 2001 and before boycotting the event, by defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. She did not drop a set en route to the final. Williams was upset by No. 13 seed Victoria Azarenka, whom she had defeated the last five times the pair had met, in straight sets. This marked the first time since 2004 where Williams lost two consecutive finals. She next played the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]] as the defending champion. She lost in the fourth round to Svetlana Kuznetsova. This marked her first loss here since 2012 and ended her 20 match winning streak in Miami. This was also her earliest exit here since 2000, where she lost in the same round. During the clay court swing, Williams withdrew from Madrid but entered Rome. She beat [[Anna-Lena Friedsam]] and [[Christina McHale]] to progress to the quarterfinals where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to avenge her loss in Miami. She then went on to beat [[Irina-Camelia Begu]] and [[Madison Keys]] to win her 70th career WTA title and to win her first title of the year. This was her third Rome title in four years and fourth overall.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], Williams dropped only one set en route to the final. She defeated [[Yulia Putintseva]] in the quarterfinals despite being five points away from losing. She then beat surprise semifinalist [[Kiki Bertens]] to reach her fourth French Open final where she faced Garbiñe Muguruza in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final where Williams was victorious. The result was not the same as that Wimbledon final as Williams lost to Muguruza in straight sets. With this loss, Williams had lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals for the first time in her career. On top of failing to equal Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams also completed the Career Grand Slam runner-up set with this loss.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At [[2016 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], Williams only lost one set en route to the final where she faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the year. This time, Williams defeated Kerber in straight sets to finally equal Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slams in the Open Era. That was Williams's first Grand Slam title of the year, as well as her 71st career WTA title overall. In what was a brilliant serving performance, Williams only faced one break point in the whole match against Kerber which she saved with an ace. Later that day, Williams partnered with sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon doubles title and 14th doubles Grand Slam title overall, keeping their perfect record at Grand Slam doubles finals intact. On July 24, 2016, Williams withdrew from [[2016 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] citing a shoulder inflammation injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12040/10511583/serena-williams-withdraws-from-rogers-cup-in-montreal|title=Serena Williams withdraws from the Rogers Cup in Montreal|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=July 24, 2016|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She next participated in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where she was the defending gold medalist in both singles and doubles and was the heavy favourite to retain those titles. Partnering with her sister Venus in the doubles, they suffered a shock exit in the first round, losing to the Czech duo of Lucie Šafářová and Barbora Strýcová, which ended their career record of 15–0 dating back to the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Women's doubles|2000 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/37006469|title=Rio Olympics 2016: Serena &amp; Venus Williams lose in doubles |work=BBC Sport|date=August 8, 2016|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In singles, after defeating [[Daria Gavrilova]] and [[Alizé Cornet]] in the first two rounds, Williams faced Ukraine's [[Elina Svitolina]] in the third round in what was a rematch of this year's French Open fourth round, but lost to the Ukrainian, bringing an end to her Olympics campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/serena-williams-loses-singles-round-three-out-rio-olympics|title=Serena Williams loses in singles round three, out of Rio Olympics|publisher=NBC Sports|first=Alan |last=Levinsohn |date=August 10, 2016|access-date=August 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811131031/http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/serena-williams-loses-singles-round-three-out-rio-olympics|archive-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days after the Olympics, Williams took a late wildcard for the [[2016 Western &amp; Southern Open|Western &amp; Southern Open]], where she was the defending champion, but then decided to withdraw due to concerns from the same shoulder injury/inflammation from earlier in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/08/shoulder-injury-forces-serena-williams-out-of-tourney/59966/|title=After practice session, Serena Williams withdraws from Cincinnati with shoulder injury|website=Tennis.com|date=August 16, 2016|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week of September 5, 2016, marked Williams's 186th consecutive week ranked No. 1, equalling Steffi Graf's record for longest run in WTA history. In the semifinals of the US Open, Williams lost to [[Karolína Plíšková]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurosport.com/tennis/us-open-women/2016/serena-williams-v-karolina-pliskova-us-open-live_sto5835691/story.shtml|title=Serena Williams suffers shock US Open semifinal defeat to Karolina Pliskova|date=September 9, 2016|work=Eurosport|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won the US Open, Angelique Kerber became the No. 1, ending Williams's No. 1 streak.

Williams started her 2017 season by participating in the [[WTA Auckland Open]] for the first time in her career. She defeated [[Pauline Parmentier]] to win her first match since the US Open. In the second round, she lost to [[Madison Brengle]]. At the Australian Open, she beat former and present top 10 players [[Belinda Bencic]], Lucie Šafářová, [[Johanna Konta]] among others to reach her 8th Australian Open final.

She lost in the final in straight sets to [[Angelique Kerber]] of Germany in a rematch of the 2016 Wimbledon final.

Following her Wimbledon finals run, Williams entered the [[2018 Silicon Valley Classic]], her first appearance in a US Open series tournament since 2015. She recorded her most lopsided loss in her career to [[Johanna Konta]] in the first round, winning just a single game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/tennis/serena-williams-johanna-konta-silicon-valley-classic-spt-intl/index.html|title=Serena Williams suffers worst defeat of her career|publisher=CNN|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams later revealed in an interview with [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] that she checked [[Instagram]] ten minutes prior to the match starting, and found out that the man who had [[Murder of Yetunde Price|fatally shot]] her half-sister, Yetunde, in 2003 was released on parole earlier in the year.

Williams's next tournament was the [[2018 Western &amp; Southern Open – Women's Singles|Cincinnati Masters]]. She beat [[Daria Gavrilova]] of Australia in straight sets in the first round, but lost to [[Petra Kvitová]] in the second round in a three-set match that lasted over two hours.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Her next tournament was the 2018 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York, where she was seeded 17th, although ranked 26th in the WTA ranking at the time seeds were determined. She defeated [[Magda Linette]] in the first round, [[Carina Witthöft]] in the second round, her sister and 16th seed Venus in the third round, [[Kaia Kanepi]] in the fourth round, and 8th seed [[Karolína Plíšková]] in the quarterfinals. The match against Plíšková was a rematch of the 2016 US Open semifinal, which Plíšková had won. This was Williams's first win against a player in the top 10 (at the time of the match) since her return from pregnancy. Williams won her semifinal match against 19th seed [[Anastasija Sevastova]] of Latvia, winning a spot in the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles final|women's singles final]] against [[Naomi Osaka]] of Japan which she lost in straight sets. Williams was warned for illegal coaching, penalized a point for breaking her racket, and then penalized a game for verbal abuse of the chair umpire.

===2019: Return to the top 10, injuries, Wimbledon and US Open runner-up===
Williams started her 2019 season at the [[2019 Australian Open|Australian Open]], having not made an appearance at the tournament since winning the 2017 edition. Seeded 16th, she defeated [[Tatjana Maria]], [[Eugenie Bouchard]], and [[Dayana Yastremska]] in the first three rounds, before defeating top seed and world number one [[Simona Halep]] in the fourth. In the quarterfinals, she met 7th seed [[Karolína Plíšková]]. Plíšková won the first set and lead in the second, but Williams took control of the match, winning the second and rapidly taking a huge lead in the third. However, after Williams twisted her ankle while up match point, Plíšková won six consecutive games, saving four match points throughout the set to win the match. This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in [[2014 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2014]], and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the [[2013 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2013 Australian Open]]). Despite this loss, her ranking climbed up to number 11.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams went on to defeat [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the second round of the [[Indian Wells Masters]] in her 2019 campaign for a third Indian Wells crown. In the third round, viral illness caused her to retire against Spain's [[Garbiñe Muguruza]]. This was the second consecutive year she had exited at this stage. She then sustained a recurrence of a long-term knee injury which caused her to pull out of Miami and Rome after playing one match.

In the first round she met Maria Sharapova for the first time since the 2016 Australian Open, defeating her in straight sets, yielding just one game in each set. She defeated [[Caty McNally]] in three sets in the second round, and [[Karolína Muchová]] and [[Petra Martić]] in straight games in the third and fourth. In the quarterfinals she faced 18th seed [[Wang Qiang (tennis)|Wang Qiang]], who she overcame in just 45 minutes, yielding a single game. In the semifinals she defeated fifth seed Elina Svitolina, proceeding to the final where she faced 15th seed Bianca Andreescu for the second time in under a month. With Andreescu up a set and five games to one in the second set, Williams launched a spirited comeback to level the set at 5-games-all. However, Andreescu was able to hold serve and break Williams to win the title in straight sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/07/us-open-women-final-bianca-andreescu-serena-williams-live|title=Bianca Andreescu beats Serena Williams in US Open women's final – as it happened|first=Bryan Armen|last=Graham|date=September 7, 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Williams's last match of the year which she ended ranked No. 10.

Williams's next tournament was the [[2020 Australian Open]] where she was seeded 8th. She defeated [[Anastasia Potapova]] and [[Tamara Zidanšek]] in the first and second rounds respectively in straight sets, before falling to [[Wang Qiang (tennis)|Wang Qiang]] in three tight sets in the third round.

On the resumption of the WTA Tour following a pause caused by COVID-19, Williams entered the [[Top Seed Open]] as the top seed. Following a tough three-set win over [[Bernarda Pera]] in the first round, Williams faced her sister [[Venus Williams|Venus]] for their 31st WTA match in the second round and came through after dropping the first set.

Williams was seeded 6th at the delayed [[2020 French Open – Women's Singles|2020 French Open]] held in cold and heavy conditions in October. After defeating Kristie Ahn in straight sets in the first round, Williams withdrew before her second round match against wildcard [[Tsvetana Pironkova]], citing an achilles injury she had sustained during her semi-final defeat to Azarenka at the US Open. This meant for the first time since 2006, Serena failed to reach a Grand Slam final.

=== 2021: Australian Open semifinal, Wimbledon first round retirement===
Williams started the year by playing the [[2021 Yarra Valley Classic – Singles|Yarra Valley Classic]], where she withdrew prior to her semifinal match against the top seed, [[Ashleigh Barty]] citing a right shoulder injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zagoria|first=Adam|title=Serena Williams Withdraws From Australian Open Tuneup Event With Shoulder Injury|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/02/05/serena-williams-withdraws-from-australian-open-tuneup-event/|access-date=February 18, 2021|website=Forbes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2021 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] Williams was seeded 10th and lost to the 4th seed, [[Naomi Osaka]], in the semifinal after defeating 2nd seed, [[Simona Halep]], and 7th seed, [[Aryna Sabalenka]], along the way. Williams's match with Osaka was the first time the two had met in a major since the infamous [[2018 US Open – Women's singles final|2018 US Open final]]. When leaving the court after losing to Osaka in the Australian Open, Williams paused to acknowledge the crowd longer than she usually would. In the press conference following the match, she faced questions about whether she was bidding farewell to tennis and retiring. She said "I don't know, if I ever say farewell, I wouldn't tell anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=February 18, 2021|title=Serena's latest loss sparks more questions about her future, but not about her legacy|url=https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/30921454/australian-open-2021-serena-loss-naomi-osaka-sparks-questions-future-not-legacy|access-date=February 18, 2021|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the semifinals of the 2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the 2010 Australian Open where Williams won in three sets, earning her 12th Grand Slam title.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Williams vs. Sharapova===
Williams lead the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the [[2004 NASDAQ-100 Open – Women's Singles|2004 Miami Open]], where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2004 Wimbledon final]], where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the [[2004 WTA Tour Championships – Singles|2004 WTA Tour Championships]], 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the [[2019 US Open (tennis)|2019 US Open]]; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2020/02/28/maria-sharapovas-so-called-rivalry-serena-williams-will-define/|title=Maria Sharapova's so-called rivalry with Serena Williams will define her career – she made sure of that|author=Molly McElwee|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=July 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors of [[match fixing]] started to circulate. [[John McEnroe]], while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."&lt;ref&gt;wine, Steve (July 6, 2000), [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&amp;dat=20000705&amp;id=2b8jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=29AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1781,581859 "Williams Sister Giving Tennis a Lift with Family Feud"]. ''Moscow-Pullman Daily News''. Retrieved April 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, [[Elena Dementieva]] asserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=35375 "ASAP Sports Transcripts – Tennis – 2001 – TMS – INDIAN WELLS, WOMEN – March 14 – Elena Dementieva"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423001654/http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=35375 |date=April 23, 2016}}. ''asapsports.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claiming [[tendinitis]]; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.&lt;ref name="etank"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/columns/kreidler/1158786.html|title=ESPN.com: GEN – There's no evidence to prove the sisters tanked|website=www.espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsworldnews.com/articles/42575/20150706/wimbledon-rumors-new-accusation-of-fixed-matches-between-serena-venus-williams-video.htm |title=New accusation of fixed matches between Serena, Venus Williams |publisher=Sports World News|date=July 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telfix"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/3001048/Williams-denies-match-fixing-as-crowd-demand-refunds.html |title=Williams denies match-fixing as crowd demand refunds |work=The Telegraph|date=March 16, 2001 |last1=Parsons |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Wells boycott===
At the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Doug | title=Richard Williams decries fans as racist | work=USA Today | date=April 2, 2001 | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/stories/2001-03-26-focus-williams.htm | access-date=July 13, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315211821/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/stories/2001-03-26-focus-williams.htm |archive-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}  As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009.  In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/12277217/serena-williams-wants-rewrite-indian-wells-ending "Serena 'proudly returning' to tourney"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818074222/http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/12277217/serena-williams-wants-rewrite-indian-wells-ending |date=August 18, 2015}}. ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 US Open===
In her [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarterfinal match against [[Jennifer Capriati]], an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpire [[Mariana Alves]]; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/08/sports/tennis/umpires-unforced-errors-help-lift-capriati.html |title=Umpire's Unforced Errors Help Lift Capriati|first=Clifton|last=Brown|date=September 8, 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that she "felt cheated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rankine |first1=Claudia |title=Citizen: An American Lyric |url=https://archive.org/details/citizenamericanl0000rank |url-access=registration |date=2014 |publisher=Graywolf |page=[https://archive.org/details/citizenamericanl0000rank/page/27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CHRIS BROUSSARD|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/09/sports/tennis/williams-receives-apology-and-umpires-open-is-over.html |title=Williams Receives Apology, and Umpire's Open Is Over |work=The New York Times |date=September 9, 2004 |access-date=March 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as the [[MacCAM]] and [[Hawk-Eye]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5933547 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105051331/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5933547 |archive-date=November 5, 2013 |title=Officials apologize to Serena for bad call – U.S. Open, Aug.&amp;nbsp;30-Sept. 12- NBC Sports |publisher=MSNBC |date=September 9, 2004 |access-date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 US Open===
In the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] semifinal round against [[Kim Clijsters]], Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a [[foot fault]], resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serena Williams is fined $10,500 for US Open line judge tirade |work=The Guardian |date=September 14, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-williams-tirade-us-open |access-date=June 5, 2010 |first=Lawrence |last=Donegan}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4468762 |title=Clijsters wins after controversial ending |date=September 13, 2009 |publisher=ESPN news services |access-date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct{{nsmdns}}necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse{{nsmdns}}meaning Clijsters won the match 6{{ndash}}4, 7{{ndash}}5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.&lt;ref name="Hefty Fine NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Serena Williams Given Hefty Fine but No Suspension for Tirade |work=The New York Times |date=November 30, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/sports/tennis/01serena.html |access-date=November 30, 2009 |first=Christopher |last=Clarey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.&lt;ref name="Hefty Fine NY Times" /&gt; Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serena Williams tries to move on from uproar over outburst |date=September 15, 2009|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/15/serena.williams.outburst/index.html |access-date=September 15, 2009 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an official statement released the following day.&lt;ref name=lat2009&gt;Pucin, Diane.

===2011 US Open===
In the final of the [[2011 US Open – Women's Singles|2011 US Open]] against [[Samantha Stosur]], Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return a [[forehand]] Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire [[Eva Asderaki]] awarded the point to Stosur based on the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]]'s deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis4you.com/links/rules/rules.htm#R21 |agency=Tennis 4 You |title=RULE 21 : Player Hinders Opponent |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064130/http://www.tennis4you.com/links/rules/rules.htm |archive-date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2011/09/serena-williamss-tirade-was-seven-years-making/42357/|title=Serena Williams' Tirade Was Seven Years in the Making|date=September 12, 2011|work=The Atlantic|last=Abad-Santos |first=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/11/serena-williams-upset-samantha-stosur-us-open-final_n_957662.html |date=September 11, 2011 |access-date=September 11, 2011 |title=Serena Williams Upset By Samantha Stosur 6–2, 6–3 In US Open Final |work=[[HuffPost]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030014958/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/11/serena-williams-upset-samantha-stosur-us-open-final_n_957662.html |archive-date=October 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/serena-williams-blows-up-again-in-u-s-open-loss?urn=ten,wp3253 |title=She did it again: Serena Williams blows up in U.S. Open loss |first=Chris |last=Chase |date=September 11, 2011 |work=Yahoo!

===2018 US Open===
Williams's [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]] ended in controversy with Williams falling to [[Naomi Osaka]] in straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of the [[2018 US Open – Women's singles final|final]]. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach, [[Patrick Mouratoglou]], gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpire [[Carlos Ramos (umpire)|Carlos Ramos]]. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/tennis/news/patrick-mouratoglou-serena-williams-coaching-us-open-final/uu0mars28xk61dkz9jkmnpk4p |title=Patrick Mouratoglou admits to coaching Serena Williams during final |magazine=Sporting News |date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty.

=== Other issues ===

In the beginning years of Williams’s professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Nancy E.|title=Sister Act VI: Venus and Serena Williams at Indian Wells: "Sincere Fictions" and White Racism|date=May 2004|journal=Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues|volume=28|issue=2|pages=115–135|via=JSTOR|doi=10.1177/0193723504264411|s2cid=159517372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to [[Other (philosophy)|"other"]] the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In 2000 the Williams sisters faced each other in a Grand Slam Tournament in a semifinal match at Wimbledon, the first time the sisters had faced each other in this setting.  After Venus won in straight sets, questions arose as to whether or not Richard Williams fixed the match. These questions increased in 2001 when Venus withdrew from her scheduled semifinal match against her sister at Indian Wells. Two days later, in the finals of Indian Wells, Williams was booed throughout the match.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; When Venus and Richard Williams entered the stadium to support Williams in the finals, Richard said that a dozen fans in the stands yelled racial slurs at him and his daughter, and that one fan yelled “skin him alive."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Following this match, the Williams sisters boycotted Indian Wells until Williams returned in 2015 and Venus in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/43379052|title=Indian Wells: Serena and Venus Williams meet after 14-year tournament boycott|date=March 12, 2018|access-date=September 24, 2019|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, a cartoon was released by Melbourne newspaper the [[Herald Sun]] depicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to “just let her win.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/editorial-mark-knights-cartoon-rightly-mocks-serena-williams-us-open-finals-dummyspit/news-story/bff3c329c6c706b966636620bcb21be7|title=Knight's cartoon neither racist or sexist|date=September 11, 2018|website=www.heraldsun.com.au|language=en|access-date=September 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cartoon was met with much criticism for being racist and sexist.

In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;National Council for Combating Discrimination in Bucharest press release, translated in {{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/serena-williams-called-monkey-by-romanian-tv-show-host-2019-9|title=A Romanian TV-show host has been accused of 'extreme racism' after saying on air that Serena Williams looks 'like one of those monkeys at the zoo'|last=Lane|first=Barnaby|website=Business Insider|access-date=September 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Romania's [[National Council for Combating Discrimination]] fined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.

== Legacy ==
Williams is hailed by many coaches, players and sportscasters to be one of the best female tennis players of the Open Era. In January 2017, [[BBC Sport]] users picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era.

===Activism===
Williams has become more involved in social change as her career has progressed, primarily using social media as a medium of expressing her views. In 2016 she posted her support of [[Black Lives Matter]] on her [[Facebook]] page, voicing her concern about her young nephew being in danger from police officers due to his skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/serena-williams-writes-about-black-lives-matter-on-facebook/ |title=Serena Williams posts in support of Black Lives Matter on Facebook |work=CBS News |date=September 27, 2016 |access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During American tennis player [[Tennys Sandgren]]'s breakthrough run to the quarterfinals of the 2018 Australian Open, it was revealed that he tweeted insensitive words about the [[LGBT]] community, followed members of the [[alt-right]], and referred to an article describing Williams's on-court behavior as "disgusting". Williams responded by tweeting her displeasure, saying, "@TennysSandgren I don't need or want one. But there is an entire group of people that deserves an apology. I can't look at my daughter and tell her I sat back and was quiet. No! She will know how to stand up for herself and others – through my example." Additionally, she attached an image that read, "Maturity is being able to apologize and admit when you're wrong because you know that your mistakes don't define you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skiver |first=Kevin |url=https://www.cbssports.com/tennis/news/serena-williams-tells-tennys-sandgren-to-apologize-for-his-alt-right-tweets/ |title=Serena Williams tells Tennys Sandgren to apologize for his alt-right tweets |work=CBSSports.com |date=January 24, 2018 |access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, Serena Williams wrote an open letter in Porter Magazine's "Incredible Women of 2016" to speak out about gender equality and her personal struggles as a woman in tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francis Bridges|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbridges/2016/12/07/serena-williams-writes-open-letter-about-gender-equality-empowerment-and-resilience/#38c5c320307a |title=Serena Williams Writes Open Letter About Gender Equality, Empowerment And Resilience |work=Forbes |date=December 7, 2016 |access-date=April 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that women's contributions to the sport of tennis are not recognized in the way men's contributions are recognized; she also called out issues of equal pay in tennis. She ended the letter stating that she hoped that her letter would inspire a new generation of women to "push for greatness and follow their dreams with steadfast resilience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Serena Williams|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/29/dream-big-open-letter-serena-williams-porter-magazine-incredible-women-of-2016-issue-women-athletes |title='We must continue to dream big': an open letter from Serena Williams |work=The Guardian |date=November 29, 2016 |access-date=April 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, Williams became the first active female professional athlete to appear in a [[feminine hygiene]] product advertising campaign. A series of online videos and print advertisements for [[Tampax]] Pearl [[tampon]]s showed her hitting balls at [[Mother Nature]], played by [[Catherine Lloyd Burns]], to prevent Mother Nature giving her a red-wrapped gift, representing her [[menstrual period]]. In the online videos, the two have dueling press conferences over the "bad blood" between them. "A lot of celebrities are not open to working with our brand, and we're thrilled that Serena is", said a [[brand manager]] for Tampax at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]].&lt;ref name="tampon ad NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Andrew Adam|title=Serena Williams' Ad Deals Survive Her Outburst on Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/business/media/29adco.html|work=The New York Times|date=September 28, 2009|access-date=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, she appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s comedic improv TV series ''[[Trust Us with Your Life]]'' and as a lawyer on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]'s television series ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Williams is known to be close to [[Beyoncé]] and made a cameo appearance dancing in Beyoncé's music video for the song ''[[Sorry (Beyoncé song)|Sorry]]'' in the hit album ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''. Williams said the director told her, "We would love for you to be in this particular song. It's about strength and it's about courage and that's what we see you as."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/culture/the-buzz/article/15499708/serena-williams-explains-why-beyonce-wanted-lemonade-video|title=Serena Williams explains why Beyonce wanted her in 'Lemonade' video|website=espnW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, Williams signed a [[first-look deal]] with [[Amazon Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Amazon Studios signs first-look deal with tennis champ Serena Williams|url=https://seekingalpha.com/news/3681717-amazon-studios-signs-first-look-deal-with-tennis-champ-serena-williams|access-date=April 15, 2021|website=SeekingAlpha|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language fluency===
In addition to English as her [[native language]], Williams also speaks conversational French and knows some Spanish and Italian. At the 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018 [[French Open]] she gave her on-court interviews in French much to the crowd's delight.&lt;ref name=USAToday-speaking-French&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chase|first1=Chris|title=Serena Williams is a regular Francophile|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/06/serena-williams-speaking-french-open|work=USA Today|access-date=June 14, 2015|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-speaking-French&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarey|first1=Christopher|title=Real First-Round Foe for Women's No. 1: Microphone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/sports/tennis/serena-williams-cruises-on-opening-day-of-french-open.html|access-date=June 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=May 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528041525/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/sports/tennis/serena-williams-cruises-on-opening-day-of-french-open.html|archive-date=May 28, 2013|quote=On they went — at Williams's insistence — in the language of Molière, Charles de Gaulle and Yannick Noah.

===Miami Dolphins venture===
In August 2009, Williams and her sister Venus became minority owners of the [[Miami Dolphins]] after purchasing a small stake in the team. They live near each other in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida,&lt;ref name="voguesept17" /&gt; which is about an hour's drive from the Dolphins' stadium. They are the first black women to hold any amount of ownership in an NFL franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Williams sisters buy into Dolphins group|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4422313|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN|date=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
In 2004 and 2005, Serena and her sister, Venus, visited hospitals and played several tennis matches in predominantly black cities in order to raise money for the local Ronald McDonald House charities. An ESPN episode was dedicated to the Williams sisters' charity tour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

"It's so rare when athletes at the top of their game are willing to embrace a set of issues that, for a lot of people, are edgier", he said. "This is not aid to orphans. ...
