Depp was gifted a guitar by his mother when he was 12 years old, and began playing in various bands.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He dropped out of [[Miramar High School]] aged 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; In 1980, Depp began playing guitar in a band called The Kids. After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married make-up artist Lori Anne Allison,&lt;ref name=peoplebio /&gt; the sister of his band's bassist and singer.

American Indians, as assimilated and mainstream as they may be today, remain adamantly resistant to anyone who falsely claims to be one of theirs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp's choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' was criticized,&lt;ref name=exploiting/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIFT/&gt; along with his choice to name his rock band "Tonto's Giant Nuts".&lt;ref name="ICTnuts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is 'Tonto's Giant Nuts' a Good Name for Johnny Depp's Band?|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|date=May 22, 2013|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/05/22/tontos-giant-nuts-good-name-johnny-depps-band-149470|access-date=May 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524200540/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/05/22/tontos-giant-nuts-good-name-johnny-depps-band-149470|archive-date=May 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTybarra"&gt;{{cite web |last=ICTMN Staff |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/12/video-tito-ybarra-greets-indian-country-phat-johnny-depp-149865 |title=Tito Ybarra Greets Indian Country as 'Phat Johnny Depp' |work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |date=June 12, 2013 |access-date=February 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725211948/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/12/video-tito-ybarra-greets-indian-country-phat-johnny-depp-149865 |archive-date=July 25, 2014 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keene1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Keene |first=Adrienne |url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2012/12/native-video-round-up-johnny-depp-identity-and-poetry.html |title=Native Video Round-Up: Johnny Depp, Identity, and Poetry |work=Native Appropriations |date=December 3, 2012 |access-date=February 4, 2014 |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222155500/http://nativeappropriations.com/2012/12/native-video-round-up-johnny-depp-identity-and-poetry.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogado1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bogado |first=Aura |url=http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/11/five_things_to_celebrate_about_indian_country.html |title=Five Things to Celebrate About Indian Country (Humor) |work=[[ColorLines]] |date=November 25, 2013 |access-date=February 4, 2014 |archive-date=January 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131191716/http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/11/five_things_to_celebrate_about_indian_country.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the promotion for ''The Lone Ranger'', Depp was adopted as an honorary son by [[LaDonna Harris]], a member of the [[Comanche Nation]], making him an honorary member of her family but not a member of any tribe.&lt;ref name="Eonline"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gornstein | first = Leslie | title = Why Can Johnny Depp Play Tonto, but Ashton Kutcher and Sacha Baron Cohen Get Slammed? | publisher = E!

==Career==

===1984–1989: Early roles and ''21 Jump Street''===
[[File:President Ronald Reagan greets Johnny Depp while Nancy Reagan looks on.jpg|thumb|Depp greeting President [[Ronald Reagan]] at a [[White House]]&amp;nbsp;benefit for The Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Fund in 1988]]In the early 1980s, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor [[Nicolas Cage]], who advised him to pursue an acting career.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;   Depp has also credited [[James Dean]] as the catalyst that made him want to become an actor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hooked on Dean, says Johnny Depp |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/09_september/26/depp.shtml |website=bbc.co.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depp's first film role was in the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), in which he played the boyfriend of the main character and one of [[Freddy Krueger]]'s victims.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; After a starring role in the comedy ''[[Private Resort]]'' (1985), Depp was cast in the lead role of the skating drama ''[[Thrashin']]'' (1986) by the film's director, but the decision was later overridden by its producer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;

Depp became a [[teen idol]] during the late 1980s, when he starred as an undercover police officer in a high school operation in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', which premiered in 1987.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He accepted this role to work with actor [[Frederic Forrest]], who inspired him.

===1990–2002: Independent films and first collaborations with Tim Burton===
Disillusioned by his experiences as a teen idol in ''21 Jump Street'', Depp began choosing roles which he found more interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moviesonline" /&gt; His first film release in 1990 was [[John Waters]]' ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', a musical comedy set in the 1950s.

The film was a commercial and critical success with a domestic gross of $53 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{AFI film|id=58487|title=Edward Scissorhands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the role, Depp watched many [[Charlie Chaplin]] films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tim Burton's latest film | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = December 14, 1990 | url = https://ew.com/article/1990/12/14/tim-burtons-latest-film/ | access-date = March 25, 2021 | archive-date = February 27, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210227183210/https://ew.com/article/1990/12/14/tim-burtons-latest-film/ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' praised Depp's performance stating that he "artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it's a terrific performance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/edward-scissorhands-19901214|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=December 14, 1990|access-date=March 9, 2021|archive-date=May 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516020611/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/edward-scissorhands-19901214|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that he "brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Edward Scissorhands'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/edwardscissorhandspg13kempley_a0a0bf.htm|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 14, 1990|access-date=March 9, 2021|archive-date=October 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008151527/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/edwardscissorhandspg13kempley_a0a0bf.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp earned his first [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] nomination for the film.

Depp had no film releases in the following two years, with the exception of a brief cameo in ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991), the sixth installment in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare of Elm Street]]'' franchise. He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy ''[[Benny and Joon]]'', he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a [[sleeper hit]]. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Depp "may look nothing like [[Buster Keaton]], but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/movies/review-film-he-s-his-sister-s-keeper-and-what-a-job-that-is.html | title=He's His Sister's Keeper, and What a Job That Is | work=[[The New York Times]] | author-link=Janet Maslin | first=Janet | last=Maslin | date=April 16, 1993 | access-date=September 29, 2011 | archive-date=May 26, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526091905/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/movies/review-film-he-s-his-sister-s-keeper-and-what-a-job-that-is.html | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp received a second Golden Globe nomination for the performance. His second film of the year was [[Lasse Hallström]]'s ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'' (1993), a drama about a dysfunctional family in which he starred alongside [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Juliette Lewis]]. It did not perform well commercially, but received positive notices from the critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=gilbertgrape.htm|title=What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=December 30, 2008|archive-date=September 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053547/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=gilbertgrape.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the reviews focused on DiCaprio, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902133.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=What's Eating Gilbert Grape Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=December 6, 1993|work=Variety|access-date=December 30, 2008|archive-date=June 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618164434/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902133.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp's final 1993 release was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s [[surrealist]] comedy-drama ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', which opened to positive reviews, and won the [[Silver Bear]]&amp;nbsp;at Berlin Film Festival.

In 1994, Depp reunited with director Tim Burton, playing the title role in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later stated that he was at the time depressed about films and filmmaking, but that "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed."&lt;ref name="Arnold, Gary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story |work=The Washington Times |date=October 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the role gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun" and that working with [[Martin Landau]], who played [[Bela Lugosi]], "rejuvenated my love for acting".&lt;ref name="Arnold, Gary" /&gt; Although it did not earn back its production costs, ''Ed Wood'' received a positive reception from the critics, with Janet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' writing that Depp had "proved himself as an established, certified great actor" and "captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Janet |last = Maslin |author-link = Janet Maslin |title = Film Festival Review; Ode to a Director Who Dared to Be Dreadful |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = September 23, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp was nominated for a third time for a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe for his performance.

The following year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite [[Marlon Brando]] in the box-office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', as a man who believes he is [[Don Juan]], the world's greatest lover. He then starred in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]]'', a [[Western (genre)|Western]] shot entirely in black-and-white; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. Depp's final film of the year was in the financial and critical failure ''[[Nick of Time (film)|Nick of Time]]'', a thriller in which he played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp starred alongside [[Al Pacino]] in the crime drama ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]. He portrayed [[Joseph D. Pistone]], an undercover FBI Agent who assumes the name 'Donnie Brasco' in order to infiltrate [[American Mafia|the mafia]] in New York City. To prepare for the role, Depp spent time with the real-life Joe Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based.

Depp appeared in three films in 1999. The first was the sci-fi thriller ''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'', co-starring [[Charlize Theron]], which was not a commercial or critical success. The second,  [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[The Ninth Gate]]'', which starred Depp as a seller of old books who becomes entangled in a mystery, was moderately more successful with audiences but received mixed reviews.  Depp's third film of 1999 was Tim Burton's [[Sleepy Hollow (film)|adaptation]] of ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'', where Depp played [[Ichabod Crane]] opposite [[Christina Ricci]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[Basil Rathbone]], stating that he "always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl."{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnny Depp on playing Ichabod Crane in ''Sleepy Hollow'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 2007 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052 |access-date=December 25, 2007 |archive-date=July 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704025641/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sleepy Hollow'' was a commercial and critical success.

Depp's first film release of the new millennium was British-French drama ''[[The Man Who Cried]]'' (2000), directed by [[Sally Potter]]&amp;nbsp;and starring him as a [[Romani people|Roma]] horseman opposite Christina Ricci, [[Cate Blanchett]]&amp;nbsp;and [[John Turturro]]. It was not a critical success. Depp also had a supporting role in [[Julian Schnabel]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Before Night Falls]]'' (2000). Depp's final film for the year was Lasse Hallström's critically and commercially successful ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'' (2000), in which he played a Roma man and the love interest of the main character, [[Juliette Binoche]]. Depp's next roles were both based on historical persons. In ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'' (2001), he starred as cocaine smuggler [[George Jung]], who was part of the [[Medellín Cartel]] in the 1980s.

==Reception and public image==

In the 1990s, Depp was seen as a new type of male film star that rejected the norms of that role.&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/03/the-fall-of-johnny-depp-how-the-worlds-most-beautiful-movie-star-turned-very-ugly|title=The fall of Johnny Depp: how the world's most beautiful movie star turned very ugly|first=Hadley|last=Freeman|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, England|date=November 3, 2020|access-date=March 13, 2021|archive-date=March 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309003209/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/03/the-fall-of-johnny-depp-how-the-worlds-most-beautiful-movie-star-turned-very-ugly|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Everett&gt;{{cite book|last1= Everett |first1= Anna |editor1-last= Everett |editor1-first= Anna |chapter= Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves |title= Pretty People: Movie Stars of the 1990s |year= 2012 |publisher= Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-5244-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming a teen idol in  ''21 Jump Street'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chang|first=Joyce|date=March 2, 2021|title=From the 90s to now: Here are Johnny Depp's most iconic roles|url=https://filmdaily.co/reviews/wtn/johnny-depp-roles/|access-date=March 26, 2021|website=Film Daily|language=en-US|archive-date=March 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210316204047/https://filmdaily.co/reviews/wtn/johnny-depp-roles/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; he publicly protested against the image, and with his subsequent film and PR choices began to cultivate a new public persona.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Everett/&gt; According to journalist [[Hadley Freeman]]:
{{quote|"Along with [[River Phoenix|Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]], he was part of a holy trinity of [[grunge]] heart-throbs. They were the opposite of the [[Beverly Hills 90210]] boys, or [[Brad Pitt]] and DiCaprio, because they seemed embarrassed by their looks, even resentful of them. ...This uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy, even while their prettiness softened that edge. They signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind of masculinity: desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that there was more to Depp, Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artistic—they had bands!—and they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. If we dated them, we understood that our role would be to understand their souls."&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;}}

Similarly, film scholar Anna Everett has described Depp's 1990s films and public persona as "anti-macho" and "gender-bending", going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man.&lt;ref name=Everett/&gt; After ''21 Jump Street'', Depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as ''Edward Scissorhands''.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Everett/&gt; Critics often described Depp's characters as "iconic loners"&lt;ref name="moviesonline"&gt;{{cite web|work=MoviesOnline |title=Interview: Johnny Depp |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_9211.html |access-date=July 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705061408/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_9211.html |archive-date=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "gentle outsiders".&lt;ref name=Everett/&gt; According to Depp, his agent, Tracey Jacobs of the [[United Talent Agency]] (UTA), had to take "a lot of heat over the years" for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at the UTA as thinking, "Jesus Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody? When does he get to be a [fucking] man for a change? When is he ﬁnally going to do a blockbuster?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|date=March 9, 2004|title=Doing It Depp's Way|language=en-US|work=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040315-598528,00.html|access-date=March 15, 2021|issn=0040-781X|archive-date=December 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225090515/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040315-598528,00.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp also cultivated the image of a bad boy. According to Everett, his "rule-breaking" roles matched with the "much publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to Depp's own personal life throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others, we clearly see a perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters."&lt;ref name=Everett/&gt;

After a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success, Depp became one of the biggest box office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise.&lt;ref name=Lennard&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lennard|first1= Dominic |editor1-last= Pomerance |editor1-first= Murray |chapter=Wonder Boys – Matt Damon, Johnny Depp and Robert Downey Jr. |title= Shining in Shadows : Movie Stars of the 2000s |year= 2012 |publisher= Rutgers University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five films in the series have earned US$4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the ''Pirates'' franchise, Depp also made further four films with Tim Burton that were major successes, with one, ''Alice in Wonderland'' (2010), becoming the biggest commercial hit of Depp's career and one of the highest-grossing films in history (as of 2021).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aliceinwonderland10.htm |title=Alice in Wonderland |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=August 21, 2013 |archive-date=February 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218045346/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aliceinwonderland10.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, Depp's collaboration with Disney "can be seen to purport and herald a new era for Johnny Depp, one in which he is, ﬁnally, as though long-promised and long-expected, the proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star but a middle-class hero".&lt;ref name=Lennard/&gt; In 2003, the same year as the first film in the ''Pirates'' series was released, Depp was named "World's Sexiest Man" by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''; he would receive the title again in 2009.&lt;ref name=Lennard/&gt;  During the decade and into the 2010s, Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film stars in the world&lt;ref name="Labrecque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC4 Washington"/&gt; and was named by public vote as “Favorite Male Movie Star” at the [[People's Choice Awards]] every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012, Depp became the most highly paid actor in the American film industry, earning at best $75 million per film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Erenza |first=Jen |title=Justin Bieber, Miranda Cosgrove, &amp; Lady Gaga Are Welcomed Into 2012 Guinness World Records |url=http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/09/14/justin-bieber-miranda-cosgrove-lady-gaga-are-welcomed-into-2012-guinness-world-records/ |publisher=RyanSeacrest.com |access-date=September 16, 2011 |date=September 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925171516/http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/09/14/justin-bieber-miranda-cosgrove-lady-gaga-are-welcomed-into-2012-guinness-world-records/ |archive-date=September 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2020, is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, with his films having [[gross (economics)|grossed]] over US$3.7 [[billion]] at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide.&lt;ref name="The Numbers"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/worldwide/lifetime-acting/top-grossing-leading-stars|title=Top 100 Stars in Leading Roles at the Worldwide Box Office|work=The Numbers|access-date=November 4, 2018|archive-date=November 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104125958/https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/worldwide/lifetime-acting/top-grossing-leading-stars|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a mainstream favorite with the audiences, critics' views on Depp changed in the 2000s, becoming more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal.&lt;ref name=Lennard/&gt; Regardless, Depp continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s, when he starred as John Dillinger in ''Public Enemies'' (2009).&lt;ref name=Lennard/&gt;

In the 2010s, Depp's films have been less successful, with many big-budget studio films such as ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' (2012), ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (2013), and ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' (2016) underperforming at the box office and gaining Depp nominations for [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s.&lt;ref name=Variety16/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=deadline2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=deadline2014/&gt; Depp also received much negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, and poor on-set behavior as well as the loss of his US$650 million fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-trouble-with-johnny-depp-666010/|title=The Trouble With Johnny Depp|first=Stephen|last=Rodrick|work=[[The Rolling Stone]]|date=June 21, 2018|access-date=March 15, 2021|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308194405/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-trouble-with-johnny-depp-666010/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-rolling-stone-650m-film-fortune-almost-all-gone-report-1202415197/|title=Johnny Depp's $650M Film Fortune "Almost All Gone", New Rolling Stone Exposé Says|first=Greg|last=Evans|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 21, 2018|access-date=March 15, 2021|archive-date=March 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210326084923/https://deadline.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-rolling-stone-650m-film-fortune-almost-all-gone-report-1202415197/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513|title=Johnny Depp: A Star in Crisis and the Insane Story of His "Missing" Millions|first1=Stephen|last1=Galloway|first2=Ashley|last2=Cullins|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 10, 2017|access-date=March 15, 2021|archive-date=February 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210218044124/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety2019"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jordan|last=Moreau|title=Amber Heard Claims Johnny Depp Threatened to Kill Her During Years of Abuse|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/amber-heard-johnny-depp-abuse-threatened-kill-1203187472/|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|location=Los Angeles, California|access-date=April 19, 2019|date=April 11, 2019|archive-date=March 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210321205513/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/amber-heard-johnny-depp-abuse-threatened-kill-1203187472/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt; Disney, with whom Depp collaborated extensively in 2003–2017, has ended their association with him,&lt;ref name=ind_Disney/&gt; and after losing a highly publicized libel trial against the publishers of ''The Sun'', Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros.'
