'''Kobe Bean Bryant''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|oʊ|b|iː}} {{respell|KOH|bee}}; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional [[basketball]] player.

Bryant also [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|led the NBA in scoring]] twice, and ranks fourth in [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|league all-time regular season]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders|postseason scoring]]. He was posthumously voted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2020.

Born in [[Philadelphia]] and partly raised in [[Italy]], Bryant was recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while at [[Lower Merion High School|Lower Merion]]. The son of former NBA player [[Joe Bryant]], he declared for the [[1996 NBA draft]] and was selected by the [[1996–97 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]] with the 13th overall pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 [[Slam Dunk Contest]], and was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a [[Shaq–Kobe feud|feud]] with teammate [[Shaquille O'Neal]], the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] to [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]. In 2003, Bryant was [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|charged with sexual assault]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Draper|first=Kevin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-rape-case.html|title=Kobe Bryant and the Sexual Assault Case That Was Dropped but Not Forgotten|date=January 27, 2020|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 14, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; criminal charges were dropped after the accuser refused to testify, and a civil suit was settled out of court, with Bryant issuing a public apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual.

After the Lakers lost the [[2004 NBA Finals]], O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring in the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]] seasons. On January 22, 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second [[List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders|most points scored in a single game]] in league history, behind [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]] in 1962. Bryant led the team to consecutive championships in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], both times being named NBA Finals MVP. He continued to be among the top players in the league through the [[2012–13 NBA season|2012–13 season]], when he suffered a [[torn achilles tendon]] at age 34. Season-ending knee and shoulder injuries followed in the next two seasons. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16 season]].

The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in NBA history to play [[List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders|20 seasons]]. His 18 All-Star designations are the [[List of NBA All-Stars|second most all time]], while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four [[NBA All-Star Game MVP Award]]s are tied with [[Bob Pettit]] for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname "'''Black Mamba'''" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] and [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]], he won two [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]]. In 2018, he won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for the film ''[[Dear Basketball]]'' (2017).&lt;ref name="Oscar"/&gt;

Bryant died, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, in a [[2020 Calabasas helicopter crash|helicopter crash]] in [[Calabasas, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52687408|title= Kobe Bryant helicopter crash post-mortem released|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date= May 16, 2020|access-date=May 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tributes and memorials were subsequently issued, including renaming the All-Star MVP Award in his honor.

Before the [[1996 NBA draft]], Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players [[Larry Drew]] and [[Michael Cooper]] and, according to then-Laker manager [[Jerry West]], "marched over these people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deals Are What Made The Lakers |work=Long Beach Press-Telegram |date=February 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers were looking to trade their starting [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Vlade Divac]] for a player's draft rights to free up [[NBA salary cap|salary cap]] space to make an offer to free-agent center [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Bill Branch, the [[Charlotte Hornets]]' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Delong|first=John|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/jun/18/lakers-trade-for-bryant-has-been-misconstrued/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20081015202520/http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/jun/18/lakers-trade-for-bryant-has-been-misconstrued/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 15, 2008 |title=Lakers' trade for Bryant has been misconstrued |newspaper=Winston-Salem Journal |access-date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school.

Jackson utilized the [[triangle offense]] that he implemented to win six championships with the [[Chicago Bulls]]; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]], [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], further cementing this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html |title=LAKERS: Los Angeles Lakers History |publisher=NBA.com |access-date=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000 season]] due to a hand injury that he had incurred during a preseason game against the [[1999–2000 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://buffalonews.com/1999/10/15/lakers-lose-bryant-at-least-six-weeks-to-broken-hand/|title= LAKERS LOSE BRYANT AT LEAST SIX WEEKS TO BROKEN HAND|date=October 15, 1999 |newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|first=Susan|last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player to receive All-Defensive honors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html#35 |title=LAKERS: Los Angeles Lakers History |publisher=NBA|access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the [[2000 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], Bryant had some clutch performances, including a 25-point, 11-rebound, 7-assist, 4-block game in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against the [[1999–2000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200006040LAL.html |title=Portland Trail Blazers at Los Angeles Lakers Box Score, June 4, 2000 |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date=June 4, 2000 |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 Finals]], against the [[1999–2000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]], Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' [[Jalen Rose]]'s foot.

Statistically, the [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01 season]] saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged six more points per game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O'Neal began to surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8847419_ITM |title=Article: No doubt: It's Bryant's team.(Chicago Tribune) &amp;#124; AccessMyLibrary&amp;nbsp;– Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=May 22, 2002 |access-date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Bryant led the team in assists, with five per game. The Lakers, however, only won 56 games, an 11-game dropoff from the previous year. The Lakers would respond by going 15–1 in the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. They easily swept the [[2000–01 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in the first round. In the semifinals round, the Lakers swept the [[2000–01 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]]. In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant recorded 48 points, 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119–113 series-clinching win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200105130SAC.html|title=Los Angeles Lakers at Sacramento Kings Box Score, May 13, 2001|publisher=Basketball-Reference|access-date=October 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They swept the [[2000–01 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] in the Conference Finals to advance to the [[2001 NBA Finals|Finals]], before losing their first game against the [[2000–01 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league.&lt;ref name="HighSchool" /&gt; Bryant ended up making the All-NBA Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).

In the [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02 season]], Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120–81 win over the visiting [[2001–02 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200201140LAL.html|title=Memphis Grizzlies at Los Angeles Lakers Box Score, January 14, 2002|publisher=Basketball-Reference|access-date=October 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP trophy]] after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were "going to cut your hearts out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 6, 2012 |title=Lou Williams-led 76ers spoil Kobe Bryant's milestone night |url=https://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=320206020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6dRrvozDV?url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=320206020 |archive-date=December 1, 2015 |website=[[ESPN.com]] |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smallwood_02062012&gt;{{cite news |last=Smallwood |first=John |title=Love him or not, Kobe Bryant a Philly player |date=February 6, 2012 |website=Philly.com |url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-02-06/sports/31030484_1_philadelphia-and-bryant-nba-mvp-gregg-downer |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6dRs8t3cd?url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-02-06/sports/31030484_1_philadelphia-and-bryant-nba-mvp-gregg-downer |archive-date=December 1, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; While making the All-NBA Defensive Team again, Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] behind in-state rival [[2001–02 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].

The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While the Lakers swept the [[2001–02 Portland Trail Blazers season|Blazers]] and defeated the [[2001–02 San Antonio Spurs season|Spurs]] 4–1 in the first two rounds of the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the [[2001–02 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]]. The series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the [[2002 NBA Finals|2002 Finals]], against the [[2001–02 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the team's points.&lt;ref name="Finals"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/02playoffs/2002-06-14-kobe.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Bryant's heroics, deference pay off for Lakers | date=June 14, 2002 | access-date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships.&lt;ref name="Finals" /&gt; Bryant's play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs.&lt;ref name="Finals" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020512/LALSAS/recap.html |title=PLAYOFFS 2002 |publisher=NBA.com |access-date=June 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809235342/http://www.nba.com/games/20020512/LALSAS/recap.html |archive-date=August 9, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cemented Bryant's reputation as a "clutch player".

In addition, he averaged 6.9 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 5.9 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]], and 2.2 [[Steal (basketball)|steals]] per game, all career-highs to that point.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered [[2003 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]] and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions [[2002–03 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs2003/series?series=lalsas|title=NBA Playoffs 2003&amp;nbsp;– Los Angeles Lakers vs. San Antonio Spurs |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the [[2004–05 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004–05 season]] with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul]]''. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04 season]] and has several criticisms of Bryant.

====Sexual assault case====
{{Main|Kobe Bryant sexual assault case}}
In the summer of 2003, the sheriff's office of [[Eagle, Colorado]], arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee.

===Music===
In high school, Bryant was a member of a [[Rapping|rap]] group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film ''[[Kid with the Golden Arm]]''. The group was signed by [[Sony Entertainment]], but the company's ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by [[Sway &amp; King Tech]] and recorded a verse for a remix of [[Brian McKnight]]'s "Hold Me". Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O'Neal's ''[[Respect (Shaquille O'Neal album)|Respect]]'', starting the track "3 X's Dope", though Bryant's name was not listed on the credits.&lt;ref name=rap_career&gt;{{cite news |last=Golianopoulos |first=Thomas |title=The Secret History of Kobe Bryant's Rap Career |date=April 12, 2013 |work=grantland.com |url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9161188/the-secret-history-kobe-bryant-failed-attempt-rap-career |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FpZJ4Iqh?url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9161188/the-secret-history-kobe-bryant-failed-attempt-rap-career |archive-date=April 12, 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of [[underground hip hop]] into a more radio-friendly sound. His debut album, ''Visions'', was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, "K.O.B.E'", featured supermodel [[Tyra Banks]] singing the [[Hook (music)|hook]]. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. The Sony president who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant's other backers had mostly abandoned him. Afterward, Bryant co-founded an independent record label, Heads High Entertainment, but it folded within a year.&lt;ref name=rap_career/&gt; In 1999, Bryant appeared on a remix of "[[Say My Name]]" by [[Destiny's Child]] on the [[Maxi single]] version of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7333081/kobe-bryant-rap-career|title=Revisiting Kobe Bryant's (Super Brief) Rap Career, Including That Time He Remixed Destiny's Child|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his wife, Bryant founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation (KVBFF). Its goals are "helping young people in need, encouraging the development of physical and social skills through sports and assisting the homeless". Bryant spoke of the injustice aimed at homeless people who are blamed for their situation, saying that homelessness should not be ignored or made a low priority. Bryant said he wanted more out of life than just a successful basketball career.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Investigations===
The cause of the crash is still unknown, as the helicopter was not equipped with a [[Flight recorder|black box]].

Over the year after the crash on February 9, 2021, the NTSB revealed that ‘poor visibility probably led pilot Ara Zobayan to become so disoriented in thick fog north of Los Angeles that he could not perceive up from down.’ The five board members also said Zobayan, who also died in the crash, ignored his training and violated federal regulations during the 40-minute flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nba.com/news/investigators-report-bryants-pilot-got-disoriented-in-clouds |title=Investigators report Kobe Bryant's pilot got disoriented in clouds|date=February 9, 2021|access-date=February 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, the Lakers played their first game after the crash against the Trail Blazers. Ahead of the match, the Lakers paid tribute to Bryant and all who lost their lives in the crash with a ceremony held just before tip off, with [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] singing "[[Amazing Grace]]" and [[Boyz II Men]] singing the National Anthem, while [[Wiz Khalifa]] and [[Charlie Puth]] reunited to perform "[[See You Again]]" – originally their tribute to [[Paul Walker]] after his death while filming ''[[Furious 7]]'' – at halftime.
