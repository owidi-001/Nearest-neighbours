Spain remained under Roman rule until [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the collapse of the Western Roman Empire]] in the fourth century, which ushered in [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribal confederations from Central and Northern Europe. During this period, present-day Spain was divided between different Germanic powers, including the [[Suevi]], [[Alans]], [[Vandals]] and [[Visigoths]], the latter maintaining an alliance with [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] via ''[[foedus]]'', while part of Southern Spain belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Eventually, the Visigoths emerged as the dominant faction by the fifth century, with the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] spanning the vast majority of the Iberian Peninsula, and established its capital in the actual city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. The creation of the code of laws ''[[Liber Iudiciorum]]'' by the King [[Recceswinth]] during the Visigothic period deeply influenced the structural and legal bases of Spain and the survival of [[Roman Law]] after the fall of the Roman Empire.

In the early eighth century, the Visigothic Kingdom was invaded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], ushering in over 700 years of Muslim rule in Southern Iberia. During this period, [[Al-Andalus]] became a major economic and intellectual center, with the city of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] being among the largest and richest in Europe. Several Christian kingdoms emerged in the northern periphery of Iberia, chief among them [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragón]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. Over the next seven centuries, an intermittent southward expansion of these kingdoms—metahistorically framed as a reconquest, or {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}—culminated with the Christian seizure of the last Muslim polity, the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], and the control of all Iberia by the Christian kingdoms in 1492. That same year, [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the [[New World]] on behalf of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], whose dynastic union of the [[Crown of Castile]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]] is usually considered the emergent Spain as a unified country. During the centuries after the Reconquista, the Christian kings of Spain persecuted and [[expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled]] ethnic and religious minorities such as [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]] through the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

From the 16th until the early 19th century, Spain ruled [[Spanish Empire|one of the largest empires in history]], which was among the first [[List of largest empires|global empires]]; its immense cultural and linguistic legacy includes over 570 million [[Hispanophone]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2017/noticias/Presentaci%C3%B3n-Anuario-2017.htm|title=572 millones de personas hablan español, cinco millones más que hace un año, y aumentarán a 754 millones a mediados de siglo|website=www.cervantes.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Spanish the world's [[List of languages by number of native speakers|second-most spoken native language]].

== Etymology == &lt;!--Linked--&gt;
The origins of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name ''[[Hispania]]'', and the modern ''España'', are uncertain, although the Phoenicians and Carthaginians referred to the region as ''Spania'', therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a [[Levant]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/espana/20140829/abci-donde-procede-palabra-espana-201408281811.html|title="I-span-ya", el misterioso origen de la palabra España|last=ABC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113170715/http://www.abc.es/espana/20140829/abci-donde-procede-palabra-espana-201408281811.html|archive-date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of accounts and hypotheses of its origin:
[[File:The Lady of Elche, once polychrome stone bust discovered by chance in 1897 at L'Alcúdia, believed to be a piece of Iberian sculpture from the 4th century BC, National Archaeological Museum of Spain, Madrid (20098349590).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Lady of Elche]], possibly depicting [[Tanit]], from [[Carthaginian Iberia]], 4th century BC]]

The [[Renaissance]] scholar [[Antonio de Nebrija]] proposed that the word ''Hispania'' evolved from the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] word ''[[Hispalis]]'', meaning "city of the western world".

{{ILL|Jesús Luis Cunchillos|es}} argued that the root of the term ''span'' is the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word ''spy'', meaning "to forge metals". Therefore, ''i-spn-ya'' would mean "the land where metals are forged".&lt;ref&gt;#Linch, John (director), Fernández Castro, María Cruz (del segundo tomo), Historia de España, El País, volumen II, La península Ibérica en época prerromana, p. 40. Dossier. La etimología de España; ¿tierra de conejos?, {{ISBN|978-84-9815-764-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be a derivation of the Phoenician ''I-Shpania'', meaning "island of rabbits", "land of rabbits" or "edge", a reference to Spain's location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of [[Hadrian]] show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet,&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite book|last = Burke|first = Ulick Ralph|title = A History of Spain from the Earliest Times to the Death of Ferdinand the Catholic, Volume 1|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co|year = 1895 |location = London|page = 12|hdl = 2027/hvd.fl29jg?urlappend=%3Bseq=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Strabo]] called it the "land of the rabbits".&lt;ref name="Spain"/&gt; The word in question (compare modern Hebrew ''Shafan'') actually means "[[Hyrax]]", possibly due to Phoenicians confusing the two animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/staff-blog/rabbits-fish-and-mice-but-no-rock-hyrax/|title=Rabbits, fish and mice, but no rock hyrax |website=Understanding Animal Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hispania'' may derive from the poetic use of the term ''[[Hesperia (mythology)|Hesperia]]'', reflecting the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" (''Hesperia'', ''Ἑσπερία'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) and Spain, being still further west, as ''Hesperia ultima''.&lt;ref name=anthon&gt;{{cite book|last = Anthon

There is the claim that "Hispania" derives from the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''Ezpanna'' meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent.&lt;ref name=anthon /&gt;

Two 15th-century Spanish Jewish scholars, [[Isaac Abravanel|Don Isaac Abravanel]] and [[Solomon ibn Verga]], gave an explanation now considered folkloric. Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. Phiros was a [[Greeks|Grecian]] by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. Phiros became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of ''España'' (Spain) took its name. Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Abrabanel, ''Commentary on the First Prophets'' (''Pirush Al Nevi'im Rishonim''), end of II Kings, pp. 680–681, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).

Iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the [[Iberians]], [[Basques]] and [[Celts]]. Early on its coastal areas were settled by [[Phoenicians]] who founded Western Europe's most ancient cities [[Cádiz]] and [[Málaga]]. Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the [[Carthaginian Empire]], becoming a major theatre of the [[Punic Wars]] against the expanding [[Roman Empire]]. After an [[Roman conquest of Hispania|arduous conquest]], the peninsula came fully under [[Hispania|Roman rule]]. During the early Middle Ages it came under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] rule, and then much of it was conquered by [[Muslim]] invaders from [[North Africa]]. In a [[Reconquista|process that took centuries]], the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula. The last Muslim state [[Fall of Granada|fell in 1492]], the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A [[Spanish Empire|global empire]] began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for one and a half centuries, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.

Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic conflict in Spain]] led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Spain suffered a devastating [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]] in the 1930s and then came under the rule of an [[Francoist Spain|authoritarian government]], which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually, democracy was [[Spanish transition to democracy|restored]] in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalised world with economic and ecological challenges.

The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the [[Iberians]] and the [[Celts]]. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, from the northeast to the southeast. The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula, from the northwest to the southwest. [[Basque people|Basques]] occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas, the Phoenician-influenced [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] culture flourished in the southwest and the [[Lusitanians]] and [[Vettones]] occupied areas in the central west. Several cities were founded along the coast by [[Phoenicia]]ns, and trading outposts and colonies were established by [[Greek colonies|Greeks]] in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-[[Carthaginians]] expanded inland towards the meseta; however, due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians got settled in the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

The weakening of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]], together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]] entered the peninsula at the invitation of a Roman usurper. These tribes had crossed the [[Rhine]] in early 407 and ravaged [[Gaul]]. The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern [[Portugal]] whereas the Vandals established themselves in southern Spain by 420 before crossing over to North Africa in 429 and [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.

[[File:Corona de (29049230050).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Votive crown]] of [[Reccesuinth]] from the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]]]]
The [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]]. These [[Visigoths]], or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed. [[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.

[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554). [[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Recared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589). The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the Spanish nation. [[Sisebut]] and [[Suintila]] completed the expulsion of the Byzantines from Spain.&lt;ref name=Spain&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermarriage between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans was prohibited, though in practice it could not be entirely prevented and was eventually legalised by Liuvigild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire: Volume 1, Portugal: From Beginnings to 1807 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-71764-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish-Gothic scholars such as [[Braulio of Zaragoza]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] played an important role in keeping the classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greek and Roman culture]].

In the 8th century, nearly all of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] (711–718) by largely [[Moorish]] [[Muslim]] armies from North Africa. These conquests were part of the expansion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.&lt;!--See next section on the Reconquista: citation not needed here--&gt; Legend has it that [[Julian, Count of Ceuta|Count Julian]], the governor of Ceuta, in revenge for the violation of his daughter, [[Florinda la Cava|Florinda]], by King [[Roderic]], invited the Muslims and opened to them the gates of the peninsula.

Under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Christians and [[Jews]] were given the subordinate status of [[dhimmi]]. This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as ''[[People of the Book]]'' but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

Conversion to [[Islam]] proceeded at an increasing pace. The ''[[Muwallad|muladíes]]'' (Muslims of ethnic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/ics/ics5.htm Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages.

The Muslim community in the Iberian Peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions. The [[Berber people]] of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, [[Berber Revolt|clashed with the Arab leadership]] from the [[Middle East]].{{efn|The Berbers soon gave up attempting to settle the harsh lands in the north of the [[Meseta Central]] (Inner Plateau) handed to them by the Arab rulers.}} Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the [[Guadalquivir River]] valley, the coastal plain of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the [[Ebro River]] valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of [[Granada]].&lt;ref name="chap2" /&gt;

Córdoba, the capital of the caliphate since [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]], was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe. Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished. Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa. Some important philosophers at the time were [[Averroes]], [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Maimonides]]. The [[Romanisation (cultural)|Romanised]] cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, giving the region a distinctive culture.&lt;ref name="chap2" /&gt; Outside the cities, where the vast majority lived, the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture introducing new produces which originally came from Asia or the former territories of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moa|first1=Pío|title=Nueva historia de España : de la II Guerra Púnica al siglo XXI|date=2010|publisher=Esfera de los Libros|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-9734-952-9|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.

The ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest) was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] won by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Don Pelayo]] in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] along the northwestern coastal mountains. Shortly after, in 739, Muslim forces were driven from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom.

The [[Kingdom of León]] was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in [[León (Spain)|León]] ([[Cortes of León]]). The [[Kingdom of Castile]], formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from [[feudalism]].

Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]], [[Francia|Frankia]] and pushed out of the very southernmost region of France along the seacoast by the 760s. Later, [[Franks|Frankish]] forces established [[Marca Hispanica|Christian counties]] on the southern side of the Pyrenees.

The [[Transmission of the Classics|Islamic transmission of the classics]] is among the main [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]]. The [[Old Spanish|Castilian]] language—more commonly known (especially later in history and at present) as "Spanish" after becoming the national language and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Spain—evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], as did other [[Romance languages]] of Spain like the [[Old Catalan|Catalan]], [[Astur-Leonese|Asturian]] and [[Galician-Portuguese|Galician]] languages, as well as other Romance languages in Latin Europe. [[Basque language|Basque]], the only non-Romance language in Spain, continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval. The ''[[Glosas Emilianenses]]'' (found at the [[Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla]] and written in Latin, Basque and Romance) hold a great value as one of the first written examples of Iberian Romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|page=90|url=http://erevistas.uca.edu.ar/index.php/LET/article/view/1774|journal=Letras|issn=0326-3363|publisher=[[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina|Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina Santa María de los Buenos Aires]]|volume=2|year=2015|issue=72|title=Literatura hispanorromance primigenia : la glosa conoajutorio del Codex Aemilianensis 60|first=María de los Ángeles|last=Dapueto Reyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break-up of [[Al-Andalus]] into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative. The capture of the strategically central city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Castile in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and [[Seville]] in 1248. The [[County of Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229 [[Majorca]] was conquered, so was [[Valencia]] in 1238. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Marinid]] dynasty of [[Morocco]] invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish North African rule in Iberia and were soon driven out.

From the mid 13th century, literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and Gothic traditions. An important philosopher from this time is [[Ramon Llull]]. [[Abraham Cresques]] was a prominent Jewish cartographer. [[Roman law]] and its institutions were the model for the legislators. The king [[Alfonso X of Castile]] focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past, and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European [[Christendom]]. Alfonso worked for being elected emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and published the [[Siete Partidas]] code. The [[Toledo School of Translators]] is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from [[Classical Arabic]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]].

The 13th century also witnessed the [[Crown of Aragon]], centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to [[Sicily]] and Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 5 The Rise of Aragon-Catalonia |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |access-date=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time the universities of [[University of Palencia|Palencia]] (1212/1263) and [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] (1218/1254) were established.

The Catalans and Aragonese offered themselves to the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]] to [[Catalan campaign in Asia Minor|fight the Turks]]. Having conquered these, they turned their arms against the Byzantines, who treacherously slew their leaders; but for this treachery, the Spaniards, under Bernard of Rocafort and Berenguer of Entenca, exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as "The Catalan Vengeance" and [[Battle of Halmyros|seized]] the [[Frankish Greece|Frankish]] [[Duchy of Athens]] (1311).&lt;ref name=Spain/&gt; The royal line of Aragon became extinct with [[Martin the Humane]], and the [[Compromise of Caspe]] gave the Crown to the [[House of Trastámara]], already reigning in Castile.

It was followed by the conquest of powerful pre-Columbian polities in Central Mexico and the Pacific Coast of South America. [[Miscegenation]] was the rule between the native and the Spanish cultures and people. An expedition sponsored by the Spanish crown completed the first voyage around the world in human history, the [[Timeline of the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation]].

Two big revolts broke out during the early reign of the Habsburg emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]: the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] in the Crown of Castile and [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] in the Crown of Aragon.

[[Habsburg Spain]] was one of the leading world powers throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading [[Spanish Navy|maritime power]]. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two [[Spanish Habsburgs]]—[[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] (1516–1556) and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1556–1598). This period saw the [[Italian Wars]], the [[Schmalkaldic War]], the [[Dutch Revolt]], the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]], clashes with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], intervention in the [[French Wars of Religion]] and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 13 The Spanish Empire|publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |access-date=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the [[Spanish Empire]] expanded to include vast areas in the Americas, islands in the Asia-Pacific area, areas of Italy, cities in Northern Africa, as well as parts of what are now France, Germany, [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|first circumnavigation]] of the world was carried out in 1519–1521. It was the first empire on which it was said that [[the empire on which the sun never sets|the sun never set]]. This was an [[Age of Discovery]], with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new [[trade route]]s across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European [[colonialism]]. Spanish explorers brought back [[precious metal]]s, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Thomas (writer) |title = Rivers of gold: the rise of the Spanish Empire |publisher=George Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=2003 |location=London |pages=passim|isbn=978-0-297-64563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of [[humanism]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the [[School of Salamanca]], which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as [[international law]] and human rights. [[Juan Luis Vives]] was another prominent humanist during this period.

Spain's 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the Ottomans at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] in 1571, and then after the setback of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, in a series of victories against [[England]] in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604]]. However, during the middle decades of the 17th century Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and then England; that by the 1660s it was struggling grimly to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars. The result was a country forced into ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|title=The Seventeenth-Century Decline|access-date=13 August 2008|publisher=The Library of Iberian resources online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921003150/http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|archive-date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle decades of a war- and [[Great Plague of Seville|plague]]-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally. Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg empire]], and help the imperial forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the [[Portuguese Restoration War|separation of Portugal]] and the United Provinces, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 14 Spanish Society and Economics in the Imperial Age |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |access-date=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.

[[File:La familia de Felipe V (Van Loo).jpg|thumb|[[The Family of Philip V (1743)|The family of Philip V]]. During the [[Enlightenment in Spain]] a new royal family reigned, the [[House of Bourbon]].]]
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rinehart |first1=Robert |last2=Seeley |first2=Jo Ann Browning |title=A Country Study: Spain – Spain in Decline |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |access-date=9 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003309/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |archive-date=9 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], was installed. Long united only by the Crown, a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state, abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rinehart |first1=Robert |last2=Seeley |first2=Jo Ann Browning |title=A Country Study: Spain – Bourbon Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |access-date=9 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003309/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |archive-date=9 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy. [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]] ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy. [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon reformers]] created formal disciplined militias across the Atlantic. Spain needed every hand it could take during the seemingly endless wars of the eighteenth century—the Spanish War of Succession or [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–13), the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739–42) which became the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–48), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63) and the [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Anglo-Spanish War]] (1779–83)—and its new disciplined militias served around the Atlantic as needed.

=== Liberalism and nation state ===
{{Main|Mid-19th-century Spain|Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish–American War|Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Second Republic}}
[[File:Rafael Riego.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rafael del Riego]] led the anti-absolutist uprising that started the [[Trienio Liberal]], part of the [[Revolutions of 1820]] in Europe. When absolutists took power again, he was executed.]] 
In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new [[First French Republic|French Republic]] as a member of [[War of the First Coalition|the first Coalition]]. The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]]. The Prime Minister, [[Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace|Manuel Godoy]], then ensured that Spain allied herself with France in the brief [[War of the Third Coalition]] which ended with the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The Spanish king abdicated in favour of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]].

Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a [[puppet monarch]] and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish. The [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|2 May 1808 revolt]] was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bell. "[https://archive.today/20120922013528/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html?page=2&amp;c=y Napoleon's Total War]". TheHistoryNet.com&lt;/ref&gt; These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating [[Peninsular War|war of independence]] against the Napoleonic regime.&lt;ref&gt;(Gates 2001, p.20)&lt;/ref&gt; The most celebrated battles of this war were those of [[Battles of El Bruch|Bruch]], in the highlands of Montserrat, in which the Catalan peasantry routed a French army; [[Battle of Bailén|Bailén]], where [[Francisco Javier Castaños, 1st Duke of Bailén|Castaños]], at the head of the army of Andalusia, defeated [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang|Dupont]]; and the sieges of [[Second Siege of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]] and [[Third Siege of Girona|Girona]], which were worthy of the ancient Spaniards of [[Siege of Saguntum|Saguntum]] and [[Siege of Numantia|Numantia]].&lt;ref name=Spain/&gt;

Napoleon was forced to intervene personally, defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat. However, further military action by Spanish armies, [[guerrilla]]s and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] British-Portuguese forces, combined with Napoleon's disastrous [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from Spain in 1814, and the return of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]].&lt;ref&gt;(Gates 2001, p.467)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaime Alvar Ezquerra|title=Diccionario de historia de España|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4JQIkW1yrsC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2001|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|isbn=978-84-7090-366-3|page=209}} Cortes of Cádiz (1812) was the first parliament of Spain with sovereign power&lt;/ref&gt; It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Independence of Spanish America|last=Rodríguez|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://www.google.es/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=es&amp;q=%22It+met+as+one+body%2C+and+its+members+represented+the+entire+Spanish+world%22&amp;btnG=|quote=It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish world}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, a [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|constitution]] for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, [[Ferdinand VII]] dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens ([[Peninsulars]]) over those born overseas ([[Criollo people|Criollos]]) and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|re-assert control]] proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|army revolts]] followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s, [[Carlism]] (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of the branch issued from [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos María Isidro of Bourbon]], younger brother of Ferdinand VII), fought against the [[Christinos|''cristinos'']] or ''isabelinos'' (supportive of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], daughter of Ferdinand VII) in the [[Carlist Wars]]. ''Isabelline'' forces prevailed, but the conflict between [[Progressive Party (Spain)|''progressives'']] and ''[[Moderate Party (Spain)|moderates]]'' ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]], the latter yielded to a stable monarchic period, the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]], a rigid bipartisan regime fuelled up by the ''[[Turno|turnismo]]'' (the prearranged rotation of government control between liberals and conservatives) and the form of political representation at the countryside (based on [[clientelism]]) known as {{ill|caciquismo (Spain)|es|Caciquismo (España)|lt=''caciquismo''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eX7cXu4N2AUC&amp;pg=PA33|page=33|title=Elecciones y cultura política en España e Italia (1890–1923)|editor-first=Rosa Ana|editor-last=Gutiérrez|editor-first2=Rafael|editor-last2=Zurita|editor-first3=Renato|editor-last3=Camurri|publisher=[[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]|location=Valencia|year=2003|isbn=84-370-5672-1|chapter=Caciquismo y mundo rural durante la Restauración|first=Salvador|last=Cruz Artacho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually&lt;!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--&gt; the United States became involved. The [[Spanish–American War]] was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]] who were analyzing the country.

Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace; Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonisation of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It remained neutral during World War I (see [[Spain in World War I]]). The heavy losses suffered during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in [[Barcelona]], as well as [[Labour movement]] and socialist and anarchist ideas. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] and the [[1870 Barcelona Labour Congress]] are good examples of this. In 1879, [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] is founded. Linked trade union to this party, [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-sindicalist trend of the labour movement in Spain, [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] was founded in 1910 and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] in 1927.

Catalanism and vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in Spain, arose in that period, being the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] formed in 1895 and [[Regionalist League of Catalonia]] in 1901.

Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oligarquía y caciquismo, Colectivismo agrario y otros escritos: (Antología)|last=Costa|first=Joaquín|author-link=Joaquín Costa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tragic Week (Spain)|Tragic Week]] events and repression examples the social instability of the time.

After a period of dictatorship during the governments of Generals [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and [[Dámaso Berenguer]] and Admiral [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas|Aznar-Cabañas]] (1923–1931), the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931 Spanish local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government.

A [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931 Spanish general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Azaña]] supported by republican parties and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalization of the left and the right. The violent acts during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'état led by José Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernize the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralization and [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].

=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===
{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Francoist Spain}}

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military [[Spanish coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'état]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]] (and from [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War#International Brigades|International Brigades]]), and the other controlled by the putschists (the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist or rebel faction]]), most critically supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of [[non-intervention]].  General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Social revolution]] also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were [[Spanish Civil War#Atrocities|many atrocities committed by all sides]]. The [[Spanish Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_corrisedrespondent/2809025.stm Spanish Civil War fighters look back], BBC News, 23 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |title=Relatives of Spaniards who fled Franco granted citizenship |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 December 2008 |access-date=18 January 2014 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074619/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |archive-date=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of [[World War II]], the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country.

[[File:Reemplazo republicano.jpg|thumb|Republican volunteers at [[Teruel]], 1936]]
The regime remained chiefly [[neutrality (international relations)|"neutral"]] from a nominal standpoint in the Second World War (it briefly switched its position to "non-belligerent"), although it was [[Spain in World War II|sympathetic]] to [[Axis Powers|the Axis]] and provided the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]] with [[Blue Division|Spanish volunteers in the Eastern Front]]. The only legal party under Franco's dictatorship was the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS]] (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS]] and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of "[[Movimiento Nacional]]", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s.

After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an [[Spanish miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[Spanish miracle#Industrialization|industrialisation]], a [[Spanish miracle#Rural exodus|mass internal migration]] from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism|mass tourism industry]]. Franco's rule was also characterised by [[Francoist Spain#Authoritarianism|authoritarianism]], [[Francoist Spain#Spanish nationalism|promotion of a unitary national identity]], [[National Catholicism]], and [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|discriminatory language policies]].

On 17 January 1966, [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|a fatal collision]] occurred between a B-52G and a KC-135 Stratotanker over [[Palomares, Almería|Palomares]]. The conventional explosives in two of the [[B28 nuclear bomb|Mk28]]-type [[Teller–Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]]s detonated upon impact with the ground, dispersing [[plutonium]] over nearby farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US to clean up Spanish radioactive site 49 years after plane crash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/us-to-clean-up-spanish-radioactive-site-49-years-after-palomares-plane-crash |work=The Guardian |date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration of democracy ===
{{Main|Spanish transition to democracy|Spanish society after the democratic transition}}
In 1962, a group of politicians involved in the opposition to Franco's regime inside the country and in exile met in the congress of the [[European Movement]] in Munich, where they made a resolution in favour of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|title=El contubernio que preparó la democracia|work=EL PAÍS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405102702/http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|archive-date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movimientoeuropeo.org/area-prensa/actividades/Contubernio-Munich-50-aniversario.php |title=Contubernio de Múnich: 50 años |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021124653/http://www.movimientoeuropeo.org/area-prensa/actividades/Contubernio-Munich-50-aniversario.php |archive-date=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/hemeroteca/20120605/54303390132/contubernio-munich-politica-oposicion-antifranquista-movimiento-europeo.html|title=El contubernio de Munich|work=La Vanguardia|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Franco's death in November 1975, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] succeeded to the position of [[King of Spain]] and [[head of state]] in accordance with the franquist law. With the approval of the new [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] and the [[Spanish transition to democracy|restoration of democracy]], the State [[devolution|devolved]] much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]. The [[Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law]] let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the [[Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria]] or [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]].&lt;!-- The 'founding chairman' of the current leading political party in Spain, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], was [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]] who had been a minister in Franco's government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012.--&gt;

In the Basque Country, moderate [[Basque nationalism]] coexisted with a [[Basque Conflict|radical nationalist movement]] led by the armed organisation [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] until the latter's dissolution in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/former_ep_presidents/president-fontaine/speeches/en/sp0066.htm|title=Speech by Mrs Nicole FONTAINE, President of the European Parliament on the occasion of the presentation of the Sakharov Prize 2000 to Basta ya!|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002164901/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/former_ep_presidents/president-fontaine/speeches/en/sp0066.htm|archive-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but had continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose [[23-F|a military-backed government]]. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King Orders army to crush coup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1981/feb/23/spain.fromthearchive |access-date=19 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=23 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrileña]] and a culture of human rights arose with [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]]. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined [[NATO]], followed by [[1986 Spanish NATO membership referendum|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. The PSOE was replaced in government by the [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of [[Felipe González]] in the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|Dirty war against ETA]]; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.

On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the [[euro]], and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&amp;st=cse|title=Economy reaps benefits of entry to the 'club' : Spain's euro bonanza|work=International Herald Tribune|access-date=9 August 2008|date=11 July 2002|author=Pfanner, Eric|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501090321/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&amp;st=cse|archive-date=1 May 2011}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|title=Spain's economy / Plain sailing no longer|work=The Economist|date=3 May 2007|access-date=9 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613212911/http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|archive-date=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the [[Prestige oil spill]] occurred with big ecological consequences along Spain's Atlantic coastline. In 2003 [[José María Aznar]] supported US president [[George W. Bush]] in the [[Iraq War]], and a strong movement against war rose in Spanish society. On 11 March 2004 a local [[Islamist]] terrorist group inspired by [[Al-Qaeda]] carried out the largest terrorist attack in Spanish history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by [[2004 Madrid train bombings|bombing commuter trains]] in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3509426.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Al-Qaeda 'claims Madrid bombings'|access-date=13 August 2008|date=14 March 2004|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624220502/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3509426.stm|archive-date=24 June 2006}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7070827.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Madrid bombers get long sentences|access-date=13 August 2008|date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], evidence soon emerged indicating Islamist involvement.

{{Main|Geography of Spain}}
[[File:Spain topo.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of Spain]]

At {{convert|505992|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Spain is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|fifty-second largest country]] and [[Area and population of European countries|Europe's fourth largest country]]. It is some {{convert|47000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} smaller than France and {{convert|81000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} larger than the US state of California. Mount [[Teide]] ([[Tenerife]]) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base. Spain is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]], having territory in both [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].

Spain lies between latitudes [[27th parallel north|27°]] and [[44th parallel north|44° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian west|19° W]] and [[5th meridian east|5° E]].

On the west, Spain is bordered by [[Portugal]]; on the south, it is bordered by [[Gibraltar]] (a [[British overseas territory]]) and [[Morocco]], through its [[exclave]]s in North Africa ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], and the peninsula of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez de la Gomera]]). On the northeast, along the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, it is bordered by France and [[Andorra]]. Along the Pyrenees in [[province of Girona|Girona]], a small exclave town called [[Llívia]] is surrounded by France.

=== Islands ===
{{Main|List of islands of Spain}}

Spain also includes the [[Balearic Islands]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Canary Islands]] in the Atlantic Ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], known as {{lang|es|[[plazas de soberanía]]}} ("places of sovereignty", or territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the [[Chafarinas Islands]] and [[Peñón de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]]. The peninsula of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez de la Gomera]] is also regarded as a ''plaza de soberanía''. The isle of [[Alboran Island|Alborán]], located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of [[Almería]], Andalusia. The little [[Pheasant Island]] in the River [[Bidasoa]] is a Spanish-French [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].

There are 11 major islands in Spain, all of them having their own governing bodies ([[Cabildo insular|Cabildos insulares]] in the Canaries, [[Balearic Islands#Administration|Consells insulars]] in Baleares). These islands are specifically mentioned by the Spanish Constitution, when fixing its Senatorial representation (Ibiza and Formentera are grouped, as they together form the [[Pityusic Islands|Pityusic islands]], part of the Balearic archipelago).

[[File:Valley of Ordesa, Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, Spain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] in the [[Pyrenees]], a [[World Heritage Site]]]]

Mainland Spain is a [[mountainous]] country, dominated by high [[plateau]]s and mountain chains. After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cordillera Cantábrica]] (Cantabrian Range), [[Sistema Ibérico]] (Iberian System), [[Sistema Central]] (Central System), [[Montes de Toledo]], [[Sierra Morena]] and the [[Sistema Bético]] (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the {{convert|3478|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Mulhacén]], located in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]], is the highest elevation in the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point in Spain is the [[Teide]], a {{convert|3718|m|ft|adj=on}} active [[volcano]] in the Canary Islands. The [[Meseta Central]] (often translated as "Inner Plateau") is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain.

There are several major [[rivers in Spain]] such as the [[Tagus]] (''Tajo''), [[Ebro]], [[Guadiana River|Guadiana]], [[Douro]] (''Duero''), [[Guadalquivir]], [[Júcar River|Júcar]], [[Segura]], [[Turia River|Turia]] and [[Minho River|Minho]] (''Miño''). [[Alluvial plain]]s are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in [[Andalusia]].

&lt;!--[[File:Official Köppen climate classification of Spain maded by AEMET.png|thumb|right|Official climatic map of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] maded by [[AEMET]]]]--&gt;
Three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and [[orography|orographic]] conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated – (see p.3) |access-date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/weather/56180d1263187925-ultimate-climate-poll-koppen-climate-classification-kottek_et_al_2006.gif World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723083834/http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/weather/56180d1263187925-ultimate-climate-poll-koppen-climate-classification-kottek_et_al_2006.gif |date=23 July 2013 }}, city-data.com, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/K%C3%B6ppen_World_Map_%28retouched_version%29.png Media:Koppen World Map.png]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mediterranean climate]], characterised by warm/hot and dry summers, is dominant in the peninsula. It has two varieties: ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].
** The ''Csa'' zone is associated to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country. The ''Csa'' zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different from each other at a local level, reason for which Köppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.
** The ''Csb'' zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western [[Castile and León|Castile–León]], northeastern [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and northern [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]) and into much rainier areas (notably [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.
* The [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', ''BSh''), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley, which crosses southern [[Navarre]], central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.
* The [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Cantabria]], [[Asturias]], and partly Galicia and Castile–León). Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]] and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (''Cfa'') also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.

Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the [[alpine climate]] in areas with very high altitude, the [[humid subtropical climate]] in areas of northeastern Spain and the [[continental climate]]s (''Dfc'', ''Dfb'' / ''Dsc'', ''Dsb'') in the [[Pyrenees]] as well as parts of the [[Cordillera Cantábrica|Cantabrian Range]], the [[Sistema Central|Central System]], [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]], and a typical [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', ''BWh'') in the zone of Almería, Murcia and eastern [[Canary Islands]]. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} during their coldest month, thus having a [[tropical climate]].

=== Fauna and flora ===

{{main|Wildlife of Spain}}

The [[fauna]] presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and [[Eurasia]], and the great diversity of habitats and [[biotopes]], the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.

The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the terrain, the climate and [[latitude]]. Spain includes different [[phytogeographic]] regions, each with its own floral characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, and [[Biotic component|biotic]] factors. The country had a 2019 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 4.23/10, ranking it 130th globally out of 172 countries.&lt;ref name="FLII-Supplementary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

{{See also|Spanish Constitution of 1978}}

The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. In June 1976, Spain's new King [[Juan Carlos]] dismissed [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and appointed the reformer [[Adolfo Suárez]] as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="From Dictatorship to Democracy"&gt;John Hooper, ''The New Spaniards'', 2001, ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spain's fast-living king turns 70"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7171971.stm Spain's fast-living king turns 70] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106025042/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7171971.stm |date=6 January 2010 }} BBC News Friday, 4 January 2008 Extracted 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[1977 Spanish general election|general election in 1977]] convened the ''[[Constituent Cortes]]'' (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Senado.es |access-date=1 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104013009/http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |archive-date=4 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution – a culmination of the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].

As a result, Spain is now composed of 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] and two [[autonomous communities of Spain#Autonomous cities and "plazas de soberanía"|autonomous cities]] with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish.

The Spanish administration approved the ''Gender Equality Act'' in 2007 aimed at furthering [[gender equality|equality between genders]] in Spanish political and economic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/03/spain-no-turning-back-from-path-to-gender-equality/ |title=SPAIN: No Turning Back from Path to Gender Equality |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=15 March 2007 |access-date=5 May 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419015814/http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/03/spain-no-turning-back-from-path-to-gender-equality/ |archive-date=19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] data as of 1 September 2018, 137 of the 350 members of the Congress were women (39.1%), while in the Senate, there were 101 women out of 266 (39.9%), placing Spain 16th on their list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the [[Lower House|lower]] (or [[Unicameral|single]]) House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in National Parliaments |publisher=Ipu.org |date=28 February 2010 |access-date=1 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archive-date=28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] of Spain in the United Nations [[Human Development Report]] is 0.794, 12th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2007/2008 |page=330 |publisher=Hdr.undp.org |access-date=18 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429033726/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf |archive-date=29 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government ===
[[File:Conmemoración del 40 Aniversario de la Constitución Española 05.jpg|thumb|The [[Congress of Deputies]]]]

Spain is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with a hereditary monarch and a [[bicameral parliament]], the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' (General Courts).&lt;ref name="Shelley2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred M. Shelley|title=Governments around the World: From Democracies to Theocracies: From Democracies to Theocracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wui6CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date= 2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3813-2|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[legislative branch]] is made up of the [[Congress of Deputies]] (''Congreso de los Diputados''), a lower house with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] (''Senado''), an upper house with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote, using a [[limited voting]] method, and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.

The executive branch consists of a [[Council of Ministers of Spain|Council of Ministers]] presided over by the Prime Minister, who is [[Prime Minister of Spain#Royal Nomination, Congressional Confirmation|nominated as candidate]] by the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarch]] after holding consultations with representatives from the different parliamentary groups, voted in by the members of the lower house during an investiture session and then formally appointed by the monarch.

Spain is organisationally structured as a so-called ''Estado de las Autonomías'' ("State of Autonomies"); it is one of the most [[decentralised]] countries in Europe, along with Switzerland, Germany and Belgium;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/18/catalonia.vote/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Catalonians vote for more autonomy|date=18 June 2006|access-date=13 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604012034/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/18/catalonia.vote/index.html|archive-date=4 June 2008}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/57/0,2340,en_2649_201185_34578361_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=Economic Survey: Spain 2005|access-date=13 August 2008|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417005653/http://www.oecd.org/document/57/0,2340,en_2649_201185_34578361_1_1_1_1,00.html|archive-date=17 April 2008}} and {{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/topics/spain?folder=Profile-FactSheet|title=Country Briefings: Spain|access-date=9 August 2008|work=The Economist|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014000013/http://www.economist.com/topics/spain?folder=Profile-FactSheet|archive-date=14 October 2012}} and {{cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/wbiep/decentralization/Swiss%20Expertise/Muralt.pdf|title=Swiss Experience With Decentralized Government|access-date=13 August 2008|publisher=The World Bank|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819191608/http://www1.worldbank.org/wbiep/decentralization/Swiss%20Expertise/Muralt.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments, governments, [[Public Administration of Spain|public administrations]], budgets, and resources. Health and education systems among others are managed by the Spanish communities, and in addition, the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on [[fuero|foral]] provisions. In Catalonia, the Basque Country, Navarre and the Canary Islands, a full-fledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the State police functions (see ''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'', ''[[Ertzaintza]]'', ''[[Policía Foral]]/Foruzaingoa'' and ''[[Policía Canaria]]'').

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Spain}}
[[File:Palau Reial Pedralbes (Barcelona).JPG|thumb|[[Palau Reial de Pedralbes]] in Barcelona, headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].]]
After the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, Spain's [[foreign policy]] priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco years]] and expand [[diplomatic relations]], enter the [[European Union|European Community]], and define security relations with the West.

As a member of [[NATO]] since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.{{vague|date=March 2015}}

Spain has maintained its special relations with [[Hispanic America]] and the [[Philippines]]. Its policy emphasises the concept of an [[Ibero-America]]n community, essentially the renewal of the concept of ''"[[Hispanidad]]"'' or ''"[[Hispanism]]o"'', as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture. It is fundamentally "based on shared values and the recovery of democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia Cantalapiedra, David, and Ramon Pacheco Pardo, ''Contemporary Spanish Foreign Policy'' (Routledge, 2014). Pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal situation concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgar.net/docs/utrech.htm|title=Tratado de Utretch – Gibraltar (Spanish)|access-date=9 August 2008|publisher=mgar.net|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153042/http://www.mgar.net/docs/utrech.htm|archive-date=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that, should the British abandon this post, it would be offered to Spain first.

[[File:Gibraltar 10000m.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view showing the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], the [[isthmus of Gibraltar]] and the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].]]
The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|isthmus]] that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other. While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the "occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of [[International Law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20Título.%20Prefacio.Índice.%20Informe%20(27.02.08).doc |title=La cuestión de Gibraltar |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain |date=January 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529192351/http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20T%C3%ADtulo.%20Prefacio.%C3%8Dndice.%20Informe%20%2827.02.08%29.doc |archive-date=29 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom relies on ''de facto'' arguments of possession by [[prescription (sovereignty transfer)|prescription]] in relation to the isthmus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? |author=Peter Gold |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as there has been "continuous possession [of the isthmus] over a long period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs |year=1999 |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/OT13.pdf |title=Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the Overseas Territories.

Another claim by Spain is about the [[Savage Islands]], part of [[Portugal]]. In clash with the Portuguese position, Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore Spain does not accept any extension of the Portuguese [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands, while acknowledging the ''Selvagens'' having [[territorial waters]] (12 nautical miles). On 5 July 2013, Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|title=Spain's letter to the UN|publisher=UN|date=September 2013|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185334/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 "Spain disputes Portugal islands"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225016/http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 |date=8 September 2013 }} ''[[The Portugal News]]''. Retrieved 9 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain claims the sovereignty over the [[Perejil Island]], a small, uninhabited rocky [[islet]] located in the South shore of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The island lies {{convert|250|m|ft}} just off the coast of Morocco, {{convert|8|km|mi}} from [[Ceuta]] and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.

Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and [[Melilla]] and the ''[[plazas de soberanía]]'' islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]] which was annexed by Spain in 1801 after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal stance has been the territory being ''de iure'' Portuguese territory and ''de facto'' Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=La cuestión de Olivenza, a la luz del Derecho internacional público|last=Fernández Liesa|first=Carlos R.|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Olivenza|year=2004|pages=234–235|journal=Encuentros: Revista luso-española de investigadores en Ciencias humanas y sociales.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Political divisions of Spain}}

The Spanish State is divided into 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country. Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the ''comarques'' (sing. ''comarca'') and the ''vegueries'' (sing. ''vegueria'') both of which have administrative powers; ''comarques'' being aggregations of municipalities, and the ''vegueries'' being aggregations of ''comarques''. The concept of a ''comarca'' exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.

==== Autonomous communities ====
{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
{{See also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}
{{Autonomous regions of Spain|float=right}}

Spain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions of Spain]]".&lt;ref&gt;Article 143 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2&lt;/ref&gt; The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economic traits. This territorial organisation, based on [[devolution]], is known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies".

The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Chapter 3. Autonomous Communities. 147th Article]. ''Spanish Constitution of 1978''. Retrieved 10 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers and comprise
* a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by [[universal suffrage]] according to the system of [[proportional representation]] and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;
* a government council, with executive and administrative functions headed by a president, elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];
* a supreme court, under the supreme court of Spain, which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community.

Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as ''nationalities'', were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |title=Estatut |language=es |access-date=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021746/http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canary Islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html#pre |title=Nuevo Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |access-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120074716/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html |archive-date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Balearic Islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |title=BOCAe32.QXD |language=ca |access-date=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711090828/http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |archive-date=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&amp;tipo=2&amp;ini=1&amp;fin=10&amp;ini_sub=1&amp;fin_sub=1 |title=Estatuto de Autonomía de Aragón |publisher=Narros.congreso.es |access-date=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211225055/http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&amp;tipo=2&amp;ini=1&amp;fin=10&amp;ini_sub=1&amp;fin_sub=1 |archive-date=11 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Beyond fiscal autonomy, the ''nationalities''—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: [[Ertzaintza]], [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Policía Foral]] respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the ''Policía Autónoma Andaluza''&lt;ref name="cartujo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|title=Unidad de Policía de la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía|publisher=Cartujo.org|access-date=23 October 2007|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107145807/http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|archive-date=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Andalusia]] or the [[BESCAM]] in Madrid.

Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the ''nationalities'' and the rest of the regions.

Finally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.

==== Provinces and municipalities ====
{{Main|Provinces of Spain|Municipalities of Spain}}

Autonomous communities are divided into [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are divided into [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]]. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Articles 140 and 141]. Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|1833 territorial division]] by [[Javier de Burgos]], and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

Spain's capitalist [[mixed economy]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|14th largest]] worldwide and the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|4th largest]] in the [[European Union]], as well as the [[Eurozone]]'s 4th largest.

The centre-right government of former prime minister [[José María Aznar]] worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the [[euro]] in 1999. [[Unemployment in Spain|Unemployment]] stood at 17.1% in June 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euro area unemployment rate at 11%|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8121455/3-31072017-AP-EN.pdf/|publisher=[[Eurostat]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731232352/http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8121455/3-31072017-AP-EN.pdf|archive-date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; below Spain's early 1990s unemployment rate of at over 20%.

By the mid-1990s the economy had commenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment rate began to steadily decline. With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999.

Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America. Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States. Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India.&lt;ref name=Economist2009bet&gt;{{cite news |date = 30 April 2009 |access-date = 14 May 2009 |title = A good bet? |newspaper = The Economist |series = Business |place = Madrid |url = http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13579705 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090504012604/http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13579705 |archive-date = 4 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours. The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.

===Automotive industry===
{{Main|Automotive industry in Spain}}
[[File:Factoría de Renault en Valladolid. Junta de Castilla y León. 2018.jpg|thumb|Renault factory in [[Valladolid]]|alt=]]
The automotive industry is one of the largest employers in the country. In 2015 Spain was the 8th largest automobile producer country in the world and the 2nd largest car manufacturer in Europe after Germany.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-makers-pour-money-into-spain-1470613487|title=Car Makers Pour Money into Spain|first=Victor|last=Méndez-Barreira|website=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, the automotive industry was generating 8.7 percent of Spain's [[gross domestic product]], employing about nine percent of the manufacturing industry.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; By 2008 the automobile industry was the 2nd most exported industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investinspain.org/icex/cda/controller/interes/0,5464,5322992_6261564_6278959_0,00.html |title=&gt;&gt; Spain in numbers |publisher=Invest in Spain |access-date=13 March 2013 |archive-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326095116/http://www.investinspain.org/icex/cda/controller/interes/0,5464,5322992_6261564_6278959_0,00.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2015 about 80% of the total production was for export.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

German companies poured €4.8 billion into Spain in 2015, making the country the second-largest destination for German [[foreign direct investment]] behind only the U.S. The lion's share of that investment—€4 billion—went to the country's auto industry.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
{{Main|Agriculture in Spain}}

Crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (''secano''), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (''regadío'') accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in [[Province of Almería|Almería]]—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.

[[File:Viñedos en Briñas.jpg|thumb|A [[vineyard]] in [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]]]

Though only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40 and 45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in [[maize|corn]], [[fruit tree]]s, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, [[legume]]s, [[olive tree]]s, mangos, [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and [[fodder]] grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.

[[Citrus fruit]]s, vegetables, [[cereal grain]]s, [[olive oil]], and wine—Spain's traditional agricultural products—continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and [[dairy product]]s. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did [[sunflower seed oil]] that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]].

=== Tourism ===

In the 19th and 20th centuries, science in Spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment. Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged. The most notable were [[Miguel Servet]], [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], [[Narcís Monturiol]], [[Celedonio Calatayud]], [[Juan de la Cierva]], [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]], [[Margarita Salas]] and [[Severo Ochoa]].

The [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] (CSIC) is the leading public agency dedicated to scientific research in the country. It ranked as the 5th top governmental scientific institution worldwide (and 32nd overall) in the 2018 SCImago Institutions Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php?sector=all|title=Scimago Institution Rankings|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Demographics of Spain}}
{{See also|List of Spanish autonomous communities by population}}
In 2019, the population of Spain officially reached 47&amp;nbsp;million people, as recorded by the ''Padrón municipal'' (Spain's Municipal Register).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&amp;path=%2Ft20/e260&amp;file=inebase&amp;L=1|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística (National Statistics Institute)|title=Population Figures|access-date=13 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524050305/http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&amp;path=%2Ft20%2Fe260&amp;file=inebase&amp;L=1|archive-date=24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's population density, at 91/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal. With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, [[Madrid]], the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain has risen 2 1/2 times since 1900, when it stood at 18.6&amp;nbsp;million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Harrison, David Corkill (2004).

Native [[Spaniards]] make up 88% of the total population of Spain. After the [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|birth rate]] plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=/inebase/temas/t20/e245/p04/a2005/l0/&amp;FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&amp;CGI_DEFAULT=/inebase/temas/cgi.opt&amp;COMANDO=SELECCION&amp;CGI_URL=/inebase/cgi/ |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística |title=Población extranjera por sexo, país de nacionalidad y edad |access-date=13 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325043135/http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=%2Finebase%2Ftemas%2Ft20%2Fe245%2Fp04%2Fa2005%2Fl0%2F&amp;FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&amp;CGI_DEFAULT=%2Finebase%2Ftemas%2Fcgi.opt&amp;COMANDO=SELECCION&amp;CGI_URL=%2Finebase%2Fcgi%2F |archive-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|title=700.000 inmigrantes en la mayor regularización en España|work=EL PAÍS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523100256/https://elpais.com/diario/2005/05/08/portada/1115503207_850215.html|archive-date=23 May 2018|date=8 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian. They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many choose to live their retirement or [[telecommute]].

Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America. Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most [[white Latin American]]s (who make up about one-third of Latin America's population) are of Spanish or Portuguese origin.

{{Main|Spanish people|National and regional identity in Spain}}

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], in its second article, generically recognises contemporary entities—'''[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]'' and regions'—{{efn|name=Nationalities|The term 'nationality' ({{Lang-es|nacionalidad|link=no}}) was chosen carefully in order to avoid the more politically charged term 'nation'.}} within the context of the Spanish nation.

Spain has been described as a ''de facto'' [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/10056|title=Rival nationalisms in a plurinational state: Spain, Catalonia and the Basque Country|publisher=Oxford University Press|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185738/http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/10056|archive-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/555054.pdf|title=España, una nación de naciones|publisher=University of Navarre|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185727/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/555054.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity. In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the [[Basque people|Basques]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Andalusians]] and [[Valencian people|Valencians]],{{failed verification|date=June 2021}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1996/08/24/opinion/840837607_850215.html|title=Nacionalidades históricas|access-date=9 May 2016|work=El País|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428110601/http://elpais.com/diario/1996/08/24/opinion/840837607_850215.html|archive-date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.

It is this last feature of "shared identity" between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal.

=== Minority groups ===
[[File:Mayer recibe la bandera gitana en el Día de las gitanas y gitanos de Madrid 03.jpg|thumb|right|Celebration of the Romani Day on 24 May 2018 in Madrid]]
Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africa. Smaller numbers of immigrants from several [[Sub-Saharan]] countries have recently been settling in Spain. There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern, [[South Asian]] and Chinese origin. The single largest group of immigrants are European; represented by large numbers of Romanians, Britons, [[Germans]], French and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm|title=Immigration statistics|publisher=BBC|access-date=13 August 2008|date=11 December 2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408081743/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm|archive-date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Distribución de la población extranjera en España (2005).png|thumb|Distribution of the foreign population in Spain in 2005 by percentage]]

According to the official Spanish statistics ([[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|INE]]) there were 5.4&amp;nbsp;million foreign residents in Spain in 2020 (11.4%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ine.es/prensa/padron_prensa.htm|title=Instituto Nacional de Estadística.

Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after [[Cyprus]], but by a great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-001/EN/KS-NK-06-001-EN.PDF |publisher=Eurostat |title=Population in Europe in 2005 |access-date=13 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819191607/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-001/EN/KS-NK-06-001-EN.PDF |archive-date=19 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2&amp;nbsp;million in 2008 out of a total population of 46&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workpermit.com/news/2007-10-10/spain/spanish-immigration-budget-increases.htm Spain to increase immigration budget] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830020653/http://workpermit.com/news/2007-10-10/spain/spanish-immigration-budget-increases.htm |date=30 August 2008 }}, 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3527 Spain's Immigration System Runs Amok] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120231934/http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3527 |date=20 November 2008 }}, 17 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/09/spain.gilestremlett |title=Spain grants amnesty to 700,000 migrants |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 May 2005 |access-date=20 July 2009 |first=Giles |last=Tremlett |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829050736/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/09/spain.gilestremlett |archive-date=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.

Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast. In fact, Spain was Europe's largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5&amp;nbsp;million people arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/um?M=%2Ft20%2Fe245%2Fp08%2F&amp;O=pcaxis&amp;N=&amp;L=0 |title=Population series from 1998 |publisher=[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística de España|INE]] Spanish Statistical Institute |access-date=14 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102141040/http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/um?M=%2Ft20%2Fe245%2Fp08%2F&amp;O=pcaxis&amp;N=&amp;L=0 |archive-date=2 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, prior to the onset of the economic crisis, the ''Financial Times'' reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.ibox.bg/news/id_1406161495|publisher=News.bg|title=Europeans Favour Spain for Expat Jobs|access-date=13 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010033728/http://international.ibox.bg/news/id_1406161495|archive-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the government instituted a "Plan of Voluntary Return" which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives, including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planderetornovoluntario.es/index_uno.html Plan de Retorno Voluntario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081322/https://www.planderetornovoluntario.es/index_uno.html |date=18 October 2011 }} Gobierno de España&lt;/ref&gt; The programme had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123275552359911807 Spain's Jobs Crisis Leaves Immigrants Out of Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041236/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123275552359911807 |date=10 July 2017 }}, The Wall Street Journal, 24 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs.

State education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen. The current education system is regulated by the 2006 educational law, LOE (''Ley Orgánica de Educación''), or Fundamental Law for the Education.&lt;ref name=LOE_juridicas&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo2-2006.html ''La Ley Orgánica 2/2006''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525013507/http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo2-2006.html |date=25 May 2011 }}.

[[Roman Catholic]]ism, which has a long history in Spain, remains the dominant religion. Although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class.

The Spanish constitution enshrines [[secularism]] in governance, as well as freedom of religion or belief for all, saying that no religion should have a "state character," while allowing for the state to "cooperate" with religious groups.

There have been four Spanish Popes. [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus I]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]], [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with [[Carmelites]] like [[Teresa of Ávila]], a [[Counter-Reformation|reformist]] nun and [[John of the Cross]], a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became [[Doctors of the Church]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] was co-founded by [[Ignatius of Loyola]], whose [[Spiritual Exercises]] and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, [[Francis Xavier]], was a missionary who reached India and later Japan. In the 1960s, Jesuits [[Pedro Arrupe]] and [[Ignacio Ellacuría]] supported the movement of [[Liberation Theology]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Protestant]] churches have about 1,200,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=estad#1 |title=Federación de Entidades Religiosas Evangélicas de España – FEREDE |publisher=Ferede.org |access-date=4 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083055/http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=estad#1 |archive-date=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 105,000 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

A study made by the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] demonstrated that there were more than 2,100,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain {{As of|2019|lc=y}}, accounting for 4–5% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from the [[Maghreb]] (especially [[Morocco]]) and other African countries. More than 879,000 (42%) of them had Spanish nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Los musulmanes en España superan por primera vez los 2 millones de personas|journal=El Heraldo|year=2020|url=https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2020/02/18/musulmanes-espana-superan-primera-vez-2-millones-personas-1359544.html|date= September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]], [[Sikhs]] and [[Muslims]].
After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]] full citizenship. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Judaism]] was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 [[Jew]]s are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision|url=https://archive.org/details/spanishinquisiti00henr|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|author-link=Henry Kamen|last=Kamen|first=Henry|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spanishinquisiti00henr/page/29 29]–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour of 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled. Descendants of these Sephardic Jews expelled in 1492 are given Spanish nationality if they request it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanz |first=Juan Carlos |title=Spain at last welcomes back the Sephardim |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453467510_159674.html |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=26 May 2018 |location=Tel Aviv |newspaper=[[El País]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Spain}}
Spain is a [[Western world|Western country]]. Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin countries]] of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.

[[File:Bronze statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.jpg|thumb|Bronze statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, at the Plaza de España in Madrid|alt=]]
The earliest recorded examples of vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked, the [[kharja]]s (''jarchas'')

During the [[Reconquista]], the epic poem ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life. The Valencian chivalric romance ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'' written in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] is also remarkable.

Other major plays from the medieval times were ''[[Mester de Juglaría]]'', ''[[Mester de Clerecía]]'', ''[[Coplas por la muerte de su padre]]'' or ''[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (The Book of Good Love).

During the [[Renaissance]] the major plays are ''[[La Celestina]]'' and ''[[El Lazarillo de Tormes]]'', while many religious literature was created with poets as [[Luis de León]], [[San Juan de la Cruz]], [[Santa Teresa de Jesús]], etc.

The [[Baroque]] is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The famous ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de La Mancha]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] or [[Tirso de Molina]].

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] we find names such as [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]], [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] or [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]].

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], [[José Zorrilla]] created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Other writers from this period are [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[José de Espronceda]], [[Rosalía de Castro]] or [[Mariano José de Larra]].

[[File:Miguel Delibes (década de 1960) - 4.tif|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Miguel Delibes]] describes the situation of rural Spain after the [[Rural flight]] in the 1950s.]]
Artists such as [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]], [[Leopoldo Alas]] (Clarín), [[Concepción Arenal]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] and [[Menéndez Pelayo]] created [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] artworks. Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general "Realism", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.

The group that has become known as the [[Generation of 1898]] was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The "Disaster" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ''Regeneracionismo''. For a group of younger writers, among them [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Pío Baroja]], and [[José Martínez Ruiz]] (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.

The Generation of 1914 or ''Novecentismo''. The next supposed "generation" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, [[José Ortega y Gasset]]—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.

[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Mercè Rodoreda]]|alt=]]
Leading voices include the poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], the academics and essayists [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], [[Gregorio Marañón]], [[Manuel Azaña]], [[María Zambrano]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Clara Campoamor]] and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, [[Ramón Pérez de Ayala]], and [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]]. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the [[College of Europe]] and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the [[Liberal International]].

The Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, [[Jorge Guillén]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], [[Dámaso Alonso]]. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ''regeneracionistas'' and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.
[[File:JoseOrtegayGasset.jpg|thumb|120px|[[José Ortega y Gasset]]]]
Spain's two most preeminent writers in the second half of the 20th century were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate [[Camilo José Cela]] and [[Miguel Delibes]] from [[Generation of '36]]. Spain is one of the countries with the most laureates of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and including Latin American Nobel laureates, Spanish language literature ranks among the highest in numbers of laureates. The Spanish writers are: [[José Echegaray]], [[Jacinto Benavente]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]] and [[Camilo José Cela]]. The Portuguese writer [[José Saramago]], also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. Saramago was also well known by his [[Iberism|Iberist]] ideas.

The [[Generation of '50]] are also known as the children of the civil war. [[Rosa Chacel]], [[Gloria Fuertes]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Carmen Martín Gaite]], [[Ana María Matute]], [[Juan Marsé]], [[Blas de Otero]], [[Gabriel Celaya]], [[Antonio Gamoneda]], [[Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio]] or [[Ignacio Aldecoa]].

[[Premio Planeta de Novela]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.

=== Philosophy ===

[[File:Fachada de la Universidad de Salamanca.jpg|thumb|[[School of Salamanca]], where humanist scholar [[Francisco de Vitoria]] developed theories about international law.]]

[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] was a philosopher residing in Spain during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].
During the period of Muslim rule in [[Al-Andalus]], Muslim, Jewish and Christian philosophies flourished, including the works of such philosophers such as [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2011-04-17|title=Averroes and Maimonides: Master Minds of 12th Century Medieval Thought|url=https://simerg.com/literary-readings/averroes-and-maimonides-masterminds-of-12th-century-medieval-thought/|access-date=2021-01-26|website=Simerg – Insights from Around the World|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Andalusia {{!}} History of Philosophy without any gaps|url=https://historyofphilosophy.net/islamic-world/andalusia|access-date=2021-01-26|website=historyofphilosophy.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages [[Ramon Llull]] flourished in Spain.

Humanist [[Luis Vives]] worked in Spain during the [[Renaissance]], as did [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (creator of the [[School of Salamanca]] and scholar on [[international law]]) and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain arrived later and was less strong than in other European countries, but during the 19th century liberal ideas arrived in Spanish society. At the end of the century, socialist and libertarian ideas also flourished, with thinkers such as [[Francisco Pi y Margall]], [[Ricardo Mella]] and [[Francisco Ferrer Guardia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In the first half of the 20th century among the most prominent philosophers were [[Maria Zambrano]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], {{citation needed|date=October 2020}} and [[Miguel de Unamuno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Miguel-de-Unamuno|title=Miguel de Unamuno &amp;#124; Spanish educator, philosopher, and author|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]]]]
Artists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and [[Hispanic America|American]] [[art movement|artistic movements]]. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]], is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque|Spanish Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]], [[Herrerian]] architecture or the [[Isabelline Gothic]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

During the [[Golden Age]] painters working in Spain included [[El Greco]], [[José de Ribera]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] and [[Francisco Zurbarán]]. Also in the Baroque period, [[Diego Velázquez]] created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and ''[[Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Anirudh|title=10 Most Famous Paintings by Diego Velazquez {{!}} Learnodo Newtonic|url=https://learnodo-newtonic.com/diego-velazquez-famous-paintings|access-date=21 November 2020|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sculpture ===

The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. [[Alonso Berruguete]] ([[Valladolid]] School) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolomé Ordóñez]], [[Diego de Siloé]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Damià Forment|Damián Forment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Other notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Roldán]] and his daughter [[Luisa Roldán]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]]. In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], and [[Pablo Serrano]].

=== Cinema ===

[[File:Pedro Almodovar and Penélope Cruz 2.jpg|thumb|[[Pedro Almodóvar]] and [[Penélope Cruz]] in Oviedo]]
Spanish cinema has achieved major international success including [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for recent films such as ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' and ''[[Volver]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Barry|first2=Rikki |last2=Morgan-Tamosunas|author-link2=Rikki Morgan-Tamosunas|title=Contemporary spanish cinema|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporaryspan0000jord|url-access=registration|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker [[Luis Buñuel]] was the first to achieve world recognition, followed by [[Pedro Almodóvar]] in the 1980s ([[La Movida Madrileña]]). [[Mario Camus]] and [[Pilar Miró]] worked together in [[Curro Jiménez]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like [[Segundo de Chomón]], [[Florián Rey]], [[Luis García Berlanga]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Julio Medem]], [[Isabel Coixet]], [[Alejandro Amenábar]], [[Icíar Bollaín]] and brothers [[David Trueba]] and [[Fernando Trueba]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Actresses [[Sara Montiel]] and [[Penélope Cruz]] or actor [[Antonio Banderas]] are among those who have become [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] stars.

International Film Festivals of [[Seminci|Valladolid]] and [[San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastián]] are the oldest and more relevant in Spain.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Spanish architecture}}

Due to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive [[Roman era]] infrastructure, [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic [[Umayyad dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Cruz|title=Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other|url=https://archive.org/details/westernviewsisla00fras|url-access=limited|editor= David R. Blanks  |editor2=Michael Frassetto|location=New York|publisher=Saint Martin's Press|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/westernviewsisla00fras/page/n68 56]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]], which built its famed palace complex in [[Granada]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a [[pre-Romanesque]] style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] streams. There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The [[Mudéjar]] style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in [[Barcelona]], known as [[modernisme]], produced a number of important architects, of which [[Gaudí]] is one. The [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] was led by groups like [[GATEPAC]]. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in [[contemporary architecture]] and [[:Category:Spanish architects|Spanish architects]] like [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Ricardo Bofill]] as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of Spain}}
[[File:Flamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, España, 2015-12-06, DD 17.JPG|thumb|[[Flamenco]] is an Andalusian artistic form that evolved from [[Seguidilla]].]]

Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with [[flamenco]], a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of [[folk music]] abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.

In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as [[Isaac Albéniz]], [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Enrique Granados]] and singers and performers such as [[Plácido Domingo]], [[José Carreras]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Alicia de Larrocha]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Ricardo Viñes]], [[José Iturbi]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Teresa Berganza]]. In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the [[Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra|Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona]], [[Orquesta Nacional de España]] and the [[Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid]]. Major [[opera houses]] include the [[Teatro Real]], the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]], [[Teatro Arriaga]] and the [[El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía]].

Thousands of music fans also travel to Spain each year for internationally recognised summer music festivals [[Sónar]] which often features the top up and coming pop and techno acts, and [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim|Benicàssim]] which tends to feature alternative rock and dance acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/london/festivals/ |title=Music Festivals, UK Festivals and London Festivals |publisher=Spoonfed.co.uk |access-date=1 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028170946/http://www.spoonfed.co.uk/london/festivals/ |archive-date=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both festivals mark Spain as an international music presence and reflect the tastes of young people in the country.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}
[[Vitoria-Gasteiz jazz festival]] is one of the main ones on its genre.

The most popular traditional [[musical instrument]], the guitar, originated in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linguatics.com/guitar.htm |title=The History of the Guitar in Spain |publisher=Linguatics.com |access-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429082016/http://www.linguatics.com/guitar.htm |archive-date=29 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of the north are the traditional bag pipers or ''[[gaita (bagpipe)|gaiteros]]'', mainly in Asturias and Galicia.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Spanish cuisine}}
[[File:01 Paella Valenciana original.jpg|thumb|[[Paella]], a traditional [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] dish&lt;ref name="paella"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/article2277058.ece |title=Spain's perfect paella |date=19 August 2007 |last=Richardson |first=Paul |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=6 August 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604174210/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/article2277058.ece |archive-date=4 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep [[Mediterranean]] roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:

'''''Mediterranean''''' Spain – all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia – heavy use of seafood, such as ''pescaíto frito'' (fried fish); several cold soups like ''[[gazpacho]]''; and many rice-based dishes like ''[[paella]]'' from Valencia&lt;ref name="paella" /&gt; and ''[[arròs negre]]'' (black rice) from Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |title=Spain Gain at Mercat Negre |work=The Village Voice |date=1 December 2009 |last=DiGregorio |first=Sarah |location=New York |access-date=6 August 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208050334/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |archive-date=8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inner''''' Spain – Castile – hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based ''Castilian soup'', along with substantial stews such as ''[[cocido madrileño]]''. Food is traditionally conserved by salting, such as [[Spanish ham]], or immersed in [[olive oil]], such as [[Manchego cheese]].

'''''Atlantic''''' Spain – the whole Northern coast, including [[Asturian cuisine|Asturian]], [[Basque cuisine|Basque]], [[Cantabrian cuisine|Cantabrian]] and [[Galician cuisine]] – vegetable and fish-based stews like ''[[caldo gallego]]'' and ''[[marmitako]]''. Also, the lightly cured ''[[Lacón Gallego|lacón]]'' ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, as in the Basque-style [[cod]], [[albacore]] or [[anchovy]] or the Galician octopus-based ''[[polbo á feira]]'' and shellfish dishes.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport in Spain}}
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Spain with cup.JPG|thumb|200px|Football is the most popular sport in the country. Spain won the [[FIFA World Cup 2010]].]]

While varieties of football have been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. [[Real Madrid C.F.]] and [[FC Barcelona]] are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. [[Spain national football team|The country's national football team]] won the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], and is the first team ever to win three back-to-back major international tournaments.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Basketball]], [[tennis]], cycling, [[team handball|handball]], [[Spain national futsal team|futsal]], [[motorcycling]] and, lately, [[Formula One]] also can boast of Spanish champions. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and [[1992 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]] that were hosted in [[Barcelona]], which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for [[water sports]], [[golf]] and [[skiing]]. In their respective regions, the traditional games of [[Basque pelota]] and [[Valencian pilota]] both are popular.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Public holidays and festivals ===
{{Main|National Day of Spain|Public holidays in Spain|Fiestas of International Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain}}
[[File:Encierro en la calle Mercaderes.jpg|thumb|[[festival of San Fermín]] , [[Pamplona]]]]

Public holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious ([[Roman Catholic]]), national and local observances. Each municipality is allowed to declare a maximum of 14 public holidays per year; up to nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2007_58.htm|title=Bank holidays in Spain|publisher=bank-holidays.com|access-date=13 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918001803/http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2007_58.htm|archive-date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Day of Spain|Spain's National Day]] (''Fiesta Nacional de España'') is celebrated on 12 October, the anniversary of the [[Exploration of North America|Discovery of America]] and commemorate [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] feast, patroness of [[Aragon]] and throughout Spain.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

There are many festivals and festivities in Spain. Some of them are known worldwide, and millions of tourits from all over the world go to Spain annually to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is [[Festival of San Fermín|San Fermín]], in [[Pamplona]]. While its most famous event is the ''encierro'', or the [[running of the bulls]], which happens at 8:00&amp;nbsp;am from 7 July to 14 July, the seven days-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. The events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As the result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.

Other festivals include: [[La Tomatina]] tomato festival in [[Buñol]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the carnivals in the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Falles]] in [[Valencia]] or the [[Holy Week]] in Andalusia and [[Castile and León]].
