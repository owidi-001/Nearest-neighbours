During the centuries that followed the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in 476, several European states viewed themselves as ''[[translatio imperii]]'' ("transfer of rule") of the defunct [[Roman Empire]]: the [[Frankish Empire]] (481–843) and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962–1806) were thereby attempts to resurrect [[Western Roman Empire|Rome in the West]].{{efn|The Frankish Empire has had a symbolic relevance for the building of Europe since the 20th century: [[Charlemagne]] is often regarded as the "Father of Europe" and a similarity between the borders of Charlemagne's Empire and that of the [[European Economic Community]] was made explicit during the 1965 Aachen exhibition sponsored by the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=Joanna|title=Charlemagne: Empire and Society|date=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-7089-1|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kikuchi Yoshio (菊池良生) of&amp;nbsp;[[Meiji University]]&amp;nbsp;suggested that the notion of&amp;nbsp;[[Holy Roman Empire]]&amp;nbsp;as a federal political entity influenced the later structural ideas of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kikuchi (菊池) |first=Yoshio (良生) |title=神聖ローマ帝国 |year=2003 |page=264 |isbn=978-4-06-149673-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=|group=}} This political philosophy of a supra-national rule over the continent, similar to the example of the ancient Roman Empire, resulted in the early Middle Ages in the concept of a ''[[Renovatio imperii Romanorum|renovatio imperii]]'' ("restoration of the empire"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Patrick|last=Corbet|title=Renovatio imperii romanorum|encyclopedia=Oxford Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|editor=Vauchez|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co.|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780227679319.001.0001/acref-9780227679319-e-2403|date=2002|editor-first=André|editor-link=André Vauchez|isbn=978-0-227-67931-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; either in the forms of the ''Reichsidee'' ("imperial idea")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schramm|first=Percy E.|title=Kaiser, Rom und Renovatio; Studien zur Geschichte des römischen Erneuerungsgedankens vom Ende des karolingischen Reiches bis zum Investiturstreit.|date=1957|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|location=Darmstadt|pages=143|language=de|oclc=15021725}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the religiously inspired ''Imperium Christianum'' ("christian empire").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Folz|first=Robert|title=The concept of empire in Western Europe from the fifth to the fourteenth century|date=1969|publisher=Edward Arnold|isbn=978-0-7131-5451-1|location=London|pages=65|oclc=59622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorp|first1=Bouke Van|last2=Renes|first2=Hans|date=2007|title=A European Cultural Identity?

During the [[interwar period]], the consciousness that national markets in Europe were interdependent though confrontational, along with the observation of a larger and growing US market on the other side of the ocean, nourished the urge for the economic integration of the continent.{{sfn|Kaiser|Varsori|2010|p=140}} In 1920, advocating the creation of a European [[economic union]], British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] wrote that "a Free Trade Union should be established ... to impose no protectionist tariffs whatever against the produce of other members of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes, ''Economic Consequences of the Peace'', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Howe, 1920, pp. 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], one of the first to imagine of a modern political union of Europe, founded the [[Paneuropean Union|Pan-Europa Movement]].{{sfn|Rosamond|2000|pp=21–22}} His ideas influenced his contemporaries, among whom was then-[[Prime Minister of France]] [[Aristide Briand]].

It also led directly to the founding of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949, the first great effort to bring the nations of Europe together, initially ten of them. The council focused primarily on values—human rights and democracy—rather than on economic or trade issues, and was always envisaged as a forum where sovereign governments could choose to work together, with no supra-national authority. It raised great hopes of further European integration, and there were fevered debates in the two years that followed as to how this could be achieved.

In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and established a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]. They also signed another pact creating the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for co-operation in developing [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Both treaties came into force in 1958.&lt;ref name="Europa History 45-59"/&gt;

The EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC and they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly.

During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''[[European Communities]]''.&lt;ref name="ENA Merge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html|title=Merging the executives|publisher=CVCE&amp;nbsp;– Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe|access-date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html "Merging the executives"] ''CVCE.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]] [[President of the European Commission|presided over]] the first merged commission ([[Rey Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2004-2009/index_en.htm "Discover the former Presidents: The Rey Commission"], ''Europa'' (web portal).

In 1973, the communities were enlarged to include Denmark (including [[Greenland]], which later [[1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum|left the Communities]] in 1985, following a dispute over fishing rights), Ireland, and the [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="ENA First enlargement"&gt;{{cite web|title=The first enlargement|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_first_enlargement-en-fa871903-53b5-497e-855f-01c9842c7b94.html|access-date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|referendum]].

With further enlargement planned to include the former [[communist state]]s of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]], the [[Copenhagen criteria]] for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993.

In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the [[eurozone]] has increased to encompass 19 countries. The euro currency became the second largest reserve currency in the world.

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the [[Three pillars of the European Union|EU three pillars]] system into a single legal entity provisioned with a [[legal personality]], created a permanent [[president of the European Council]], the first of which was [[Herman Van Rompuy]], and strengthened the position of the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy]].{{sfn|Piris|2010|page=448}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|title=European Parliament announces new President and Foreign Affairs Minister|access-date=1 December 2009|archive-date=15 May 2016|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515055515/http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has no formal connection to any religion. Article 17 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Part_One:_Principles#Article_17|title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations".&lt;ref name="Consolidated Treaties" /&gt;

The preamble to the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe".&lt;ref name="Consolidated Treaties"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:SOM:EN:HTML "Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union"].&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] included proposals to mention [[Christianity]] or a [[god]], or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.&lt;ref name="EUO Merkel God"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-celebrates-its-50th-birthday--with-a-row-about-religion-440976.html |title=EU celebrates 50th birthday-with a row about religion |work=The Independent |location=London |first=Stephen |last=Castle |date=21 March 2007 |access-date=4 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405065450/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-celebrates-its-50th-birthday--with-a-row-about-religion-440976.html |archive-date=5 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in the European Union are divided among members of Catholicism (both [[Latin Church|Roman]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]]), numerous [[Protestant]] denominations ([[Anglicans]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Reformed]] forming the bulk of this category), and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In 2009, the EU had an estimated [[List of countries by Muslim population|Muslim population]] of 13&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="mgmpPRC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim Population |publisher=europa web portal |url=http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Manifestations_EN.pdf|access-date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated [[Jewish population]] of over a million.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish population figures may be unreliable. {{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/demography/demjpop.html |title=World Jewish Population (2002) |access-date=3 May 2007 |author=Sergio DellaPergola |work=American Jewish Year Book |publisher=The Jewish Agency for Israel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041222130930/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/demography/demjpop.html |archive-date=22 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other world religions of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Sikhism]] are also represented in the EU population.

According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2015 by [[Eurobarometer]], [[Christianity]] is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 71.6 per cent of the EU population. [[Catholics]] are the largest Christian group, accounting for 45.3 per cent of the EU population, while [[Protestant]]s make up 11.1 per cent, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] make up 9.6 per cent, and other Christians make up 5.6 per cent.&lt;ref name="EB2015"/&gt;

[[Eurostat]]'s [[Eurobarometer]] opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 per cent of EU citizens believed in a god, 27 per cent in "some sort of spirit or life force", and 18 per cent had no form of belief.&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Special Eurobarometer 225 |title=Social values, Science and Technology |publisher=Europa, web portal |author=Eurostat |author-link=Eurostat |year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |page=9 |access-date=11 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524004644/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.&lt;ref name="About SecE"&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-21-god-europe_x.htm|title=What place for God in Europe|access-date=24 July 2009|date=22 February 2005|first=Peter|last=Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16 per cent) and the Czech Republic (19 per cent).&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"/&gt; The most religious countries were Malta (95 per cent, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90 per cent of citizens professing a belief in their respective god. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale".&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"/&gt;

Through successive [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements]], the European Union has grown from the [[Inner Six|six founding states]] (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to {{EUnum}} members. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]], thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|title=Answers {{ndash}} The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com|access-date=12 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120091030/http://www.answers.com/topic/pooled-sovereignty|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU institutions and other bodies |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm |publisher=Europa |access-date=4 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601191547/http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm |archive-date=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a member, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning [[market economy]]; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.&lt;ref name="Accession Criteria"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria) |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm |access-date=26 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705172736/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm |archive-date=5 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] of the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] provides the basis for a member to [[Withdrawal from the European Union|leave the EU]].

Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] (north-east Europe) to tropical ([[French Guiana]]), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (Northern [[Balkans]] and Central Europe).&lt;ref name="Humid Continental climate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |title=Humid Continental Climate |year=2007 |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |work=The physical environment |access-date=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530170321/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |archive-date=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75 per cent of inhabitants living in [[urban area]]s as of 2006. Cities are largely spread out across the EU with a large grouping in and around the [[Benelux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/eea_report_2006_10/eea_report_10_2006.pdf |title=Urban sprawl in Europe: The ignored challenge, European Environmental Agency |date=2006|access-date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories]] and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] of various member states are also formally part of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Europe's overseas territories: What you need to know |url=https://www.dw.com/en/europes-overseas-territories-what-you-need-to-know/a-46145298 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Organs of the European Union.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Organigram of the political system with the seven institutions of the Union in blue, national / intergovernmental elements in orange]]

The European Union operates through a hybrid system of [[Supranational union|supranational]] and [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] decision-making,&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=European Union|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/196399/European-Union |access-date=3 July 2013 |quote=international organisation comprising 28 European countries and governing common economic, social, and security policies&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web |title=European Union |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |work=The World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/european-union/|access-date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the principles of [[Principle of conferral|conferral]] (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]) and of [[Subsidiarity#European Union law|subsidiarity]] (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). [[European Union law|Laws made by the EU institutions]] are passed in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;According to P.C. Schmitter, Comparative Politics: Its Past, Present and Future (2016), 1 Chinese Political Science Review, 397, at 410, "European Union is the most complex polity in the world".&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).&lt;ref&gt;These legislative instruments are dealt with in more detail [[#Acts|below]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutionally, the EU bears some resemblance to both a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]],&lt;ref&gt;Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004). The European Constitution in the Making. Centre for European Policy Studies. pp. 21–26. {{ISBN|978-92-9079-493-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Michael (2000). Federalism and European union: The building of Europe, 1950–2000. Routledge. p. 49. {{ISBN|0-415-22647-3}}. "Our theoretical analysis suggests that the EC/EU is neither a federation nor a confederation in the classical sense. But it does claim that the European political and economic elites have shaped and moulded the EC/EU into a new form of international organization, namely, a species of "new" confederation."&lt;/ref&gt; but has not formally defined itself as either. (It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the [[Treaty of European Union]] and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]). It is more integrated than a traditional confederation of states because the general level of government widely employs [[qualified majority voting]] in some decision-making among the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-majority/|title=Qualified majority – Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://signon.thomsonreuters.com/?comp=pluk&amp;productid=PLCUK&amp;viewproductid=UKPL&amp;lr=0&amp;culture=en-US&amp;returnto=https%3a%2f%2fuk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com%2fCosi%2fSignOn%3fcomp%3dpluk%26redirectTo%3d%252f9-503-0498%253ftransitionType%253dDefault%2526contextData%253d(sc.Default)%2526firstPage%253dtrue%2526comp%253dpluk%2526bhcp%253d1&amp;tracetoken=0410191706400iocfH6ix9aDAXboKMKljGSEQbVenO3hRbkBiVwSpjK1nPrIZleK0m_ZYArfREaHTp00rbJNn9JJiUMtpuREV-tBpbDUn6jga8Zl9POgeorx-_ajnZ8E3JYaIx_LR8_3ZDgttQ2Na2blkP5wVQ4ab8NCop3kx46Kc2OAzz_TmEl3CC7PuHaHnrnMSp6Iff0Ha6hnq7X8w-OJXGJwNOPAhExqg5qLTz6c5ZWem1fKcj3l-9-h9cvMeVpfodmsngI5XZ8ruL99SM4ZCzGSNyROceid4Z3KboCsVabuZY0E-uiLtwSweJKfAwbVwR05UE0UIdD0SkAXveKEjxj9NIp2XCOCilihh1It2arRlZYHQ0Fc|title=Practical Law UK Signon|website=signon.thomsonreuters.com|access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called ''Kompetenz-kompetenz''); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of [[subsidiarity]] requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.

The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]]: the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Council]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.

EU policy is in general promulgated by [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]], which are then implemented in the [[Sovereignty|domestic legislation]] of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], which are immediately enforceable in all member states. [[Lobbying#European Union|Lobbying]] at EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130558/LDM_BRI(2013)130558_REV1_EN.pdf |title=EU Library Briefing:Lobbying the EU institutions |work=Europarl |access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Council====&lt;!-- Heads of state --&gt;
{{Main|European Council}}

[[File:Charles Michel (49467991288).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[President of the European Council]], [[Charles Michel]]]]
The European Council gives political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the [[president of the European Council]] (presently [[Charles Michel]]), the [[president of the European Commission]] and one representative per [[member state of the European Union|member state]] (either its [[head of state]] or [[head of government]]). The [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy]] (presently [[Josep Borrell]]) also takes part in its meetings. It has been described by some as the union's "supreme political authority".&lt;ref name="How work"&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the EU work|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|access-date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is actively involved in the negotiation of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaty changes]] and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.

The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a "[[head of state|collective head of state]]" and [[ratification|ratifies]] important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aMsWxEnaqrUC&amp;pg=PA146 ''With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective''] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:&lt;br /&gt;''Fourth, the European Council acts a "collective head of state" for the EU.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasks for the president of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,&lt;ref name="Council Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111298.pdf|title=President of the European Council|access-date=24 November 2009|date=24 November 2009|publisher=General Secretariat of the Council of the EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them.

The European Council should not be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]], an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg.

[[File:Ursula von der Leyen (49468709252).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[President of the European Commission]], [[Ursula von der Leyen]]]]
The European Commission acts both as the EU's [[executive (government)|executive arm]], responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, and also the [[Right of initiative (legislative)|legislative initiator]], with the sole power to propose laws for debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers|work=European Parliament|title=Legislative powers|access-date=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of European Parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2013/130619/LDM_BRI(2013)130619_REV2_EN.pdf|work=Library of the European Parliament|title=Parliament's legislative initiative|date=24 October 2013|access-date=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law_en|work=European Commission|title=Planning and proposing law|date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/d5906df5-4f83-4603-85f7-0cabc24b9fe1/28d57ad3-6f5e-4f9c-82a8-be9535febad5 | title=Guardian of the Treaties | work=CVCE Education Unit| publisher = University of Luxembourg | access-date = 8 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates ''de facto'' as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet government]],{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} with 27 [[European Commissioner|European commissioners]] for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.

One of the 27 is the [[president of the European Commission]] (presently [[Ursula von der Leyen]] for 2019{{ndash}}2024), [[President of the European Commission#Appointment|appointed by the European Council]], subject to the Parliament's approval. After the President, the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy, who is ''ex-officio'' a [[Vice-President of the European Commission|vice-president of the European Commission]] and is also chosen by the European Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|Treaty on European Union: Article 17:7]]&lt;/ref&gt; The other 26 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]] in agreement with the nominated president. The 27 commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by vote of the [[European Parliament]].

The Council of the European Union (also called the Council&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''consilium'' is occasionally used when a single identifier is required, as on [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ the Council Web site].&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Council of Ministers", its former title)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/pol/inst/index_en.htm |title=Institutional affairs: Council of the European Union |date=6 January 2010 |work=Europa |publisher=European Commission |quote=It is commonly called the Council of Ministers}}.&lt;/ref&gt; forms one half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a representative from each member state's government and meets in [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed]]. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body. In addition to the legislative functions, members of the council also have [[executive functions|executive]] responsibilities, such as the development of a [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and the coordination of broad economic policies within the Union.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |access-date=25 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703155822/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm |archive-date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the council]] rotates between member states, with each holding it for six months. Beginning on 1 July 2021, the position is held by [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slovenian-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/presidency/presidency-of-the-council-of-the-european-union/ |title=Presidency of the Council of the European Union |publisher=Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union |access-date=6 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the union. Examples of such alliances include the [[Visegrad Group]], [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]], the [[New Hanseatic League]], the [[Weimar Triangle]], the [[Lublin Triangle]], [[EU Med Group]], the [[Craiova Group]] and [[Bucharest Nine]].

====European Parliament====&lt;!-- Legislative lower-house --&gt;
{{Main|European Parliament}}

[[File:David Sassoli 2020 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[President of the European Parliament]], [[David Sassoli]]]]

The European Parliament is one of three [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative institutions]] of the EU, which together with the [[Council of the European Union]] is tasked with amending and approving the European Commission's proposals. 705 [[Member of the European Parliament|members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly [[Elections in the European Union|elected]] by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]] where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wellfire Interactive |url=http://www.fairvote.org/european-parliament-to-be-elected-with-proportional-representation-systems |title=MEPs must be elected on the basis of proportional representation, the threshold must not exceed 5%, and the electoral area may be subdivided in constituencies if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system |publisher=Fairvote.org |access-date=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[ordinary legislative procedure]], the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the [[budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. The parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]]. The [[president of the European Parliament]] (presently [[David Sassoli]]) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The president and [[Vice President of the European Parliament|vice-presidents]] are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: The European Parliament |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm |access-date=25 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624114722/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm |archive-date=24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budget===

{{Main|Budget of the European Union}}

The European Union had an agreed budget of {{Euro|120.7}}&amp;nbsp;billion for the year 2007 and {{Euro|864.3}}&amp;nbsp;billion for the period 2007–2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-06-204_en.htm|title=European Commission – PRESS RELEASES – Press release – Q&amp;A on Interinstitutional Agreement on Budgetary Discipline and Sound Financial Management 2007–2013|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 1.10 per cent and 1.05 per cent of the EU-27's [[Gross national income|GNI]] forecast for the respective periods. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03 per cent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |publisher=Profile Books |place=London |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-86197-102-9 |author=David Smith. |title=Will Europe work?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 budget of {{Euro|141.5}}&amp;nbsp;billion, the largest single expenditure item is "''[[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion &amp; competitiveness]]''" with around 45 per cent of the total budget.&lt;ref name="EUBudget2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Budget in detail 2010 |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |format=PDF |url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm |access-date=20 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815112106/http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm |archive-date=15 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next comes "''[[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]]''" with approximately 31 per cent of the total.&lt;ref name="EUBudget2010"/&gt; "''Rural development, environment and [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]]''" takes up around 11 per cent.&lt;ref name="EUBudget2010"/&gt; "''Administration''" accounts for around 6 per cent.&lt;ref name="EUBudget2010"/&gt; The "''EU as a global partner''" and "''citizenship, freedom, security and justice''" bring up the rear with approximately 6 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.&lt;ref name="EUBudget2010"/&gt;

The [[Court of Auditors]] is legally obliged to provide the parliament and the council (specifically, the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]]) with "a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Section 7, Article 287.{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&amp;from=EN | title = Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors |publisher=Europa (web portal) |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm |access-date=8 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222001147/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm |archive-date=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commission's handling of the budget.

The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level.&lt;ref name="European Court of Auditors"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 annual report|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/AR_2012.aspx|access-date=13 November 2015}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/european-auditors-point-to-errors-but-sign-off-eus-accounts/|title=European auditors point to errors but sign off EU's accounts – some UK media decline to listen to what the auditors say|publisher=Europa (web portal)|access-date=13 November 2015}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]] and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion fund]], were materially affected by error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/5926723.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221211745/http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/5926723.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 February 2011 |title=Annual Report of the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget concerning the financial year 2009, together with the institutions' replies |page=12 |access-date=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was {{Euro|1,863}}&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf|title=Protection of the European Union's financial interests – Fight against fraud – Annual Report 2009 (''vid.'' pp. 6, 15)|publisher=Europa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729063014/http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf|archive-date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2020, members of the union, [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]], blocked approval to the EU's budget at a meeting in the [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (Coreper), citing a proposal that linked funding with adherence to the rule of law. The budget included a [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]] recovery fund of {{Euro|750}}{{nbsp}}billion. The budget may still be approved if Hungary and Poland withdraw their vetos after further negotiations in the council and the [[European Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-and-poland-block-progress-on-e1-8-trillion-package/|title=Hungary and Poland block EU coronavirus recovery package|access-date=16 November 2020|website=Politico|date=16 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54964858|title=EU budget blocked by Hungary and Poland over rule of law issue|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2020|access-date=16 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competences===
Member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/events/2009/index.html|title=Competences and consumers|access-date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative procedure]] is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.

The distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided in the following three categories:

{{EU competences}}

==Legal system and justice==
{{Further|European Union law|Treaties of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
The European Union is based on a series of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of EU law|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228193407/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archive-date=28 February 2008|publisher=European Commission|access-date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="art249"&gt;See Article 288 (ex Article 249 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="Direct Effect"&gt;According to the principle of Direct Effect first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in {{cite court|litigants=Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|reporter=Eur-Lex|court=European Court of Justice|year=1963|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:NOT}} See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has [[legal personality]], with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Philippe |last1=de Schoutheete|last2=Andoura |first2=Sami |title=The Legal Personality of the European Union |journal=Studia Diplomatica |volume=LX |year=2007 |issue=1 |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/9083/01/Legal.Personality.EU-PDS-SA.pdf |access-date=15 November 2010}} Its examples are the ratifications of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] by EU. And Article 47 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principle of [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]], national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="Supremacy"&gt;According to the principle of [[Law of the European Union#Supremacy|Supremacy]] as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: [[Factortame litigation]]: ''Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'', ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265) and ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; ''Raoul George Nicolo'' [1990] 1 CMLR 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[direct effect]] and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman [[Robert Lecourt]]&lt;ref&gt;William Phelan, ''Great Judgments of the European Court of Justice: Rethinking the Landmark Decisions of the Foundational Period'' (Cambridge, 2019).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Justice of the European Union===
[[File:Towers of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) after fifth extension, January 2020.jpg|thumb|The CJEU's seat, the [[Palais de la Cour de Justice]], in [[Luxembourg City]].]]
The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of the European Union is formally called the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] and consists of two courts: the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] and the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF |title=Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and [[Preliminary ruling|cases referred to it]] by the courts of member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court of Justice: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/#competences |publisher=Europa web portal |access-date=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the doctrines of [[direct effect]] and supremacy, many judgments of the Court of Justice are automatically applicable within the internal legal orders of the member states.

The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Court: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/#compet |publisher=Europa web portal |access-date=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and [[European Civil Service|its civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Service Tribunal: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/T5_5230/#compétence |publisher=Europa web portal |access-date=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 256(1) (ex article 225(1)) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental rights===
The treaties declare that the European Union itself is "founded on the values of respect for [[human dignity]], [[liberty|freedom]], democracy, [[equality before the law|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]]&amp;nbsp;... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|Article 2, Treaty on European Union (consolidated 1 December 2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Lisbon Treaty]] gave legal effect to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The charter is a codified catalogue of [[fundamental right]]s against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states."&lt;ref&gt;Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v. Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel; Article 6(2) of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.&lt;ref name="europarl-rights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/2_1_1_en.htm|title=Respect for fundamental rights in the EU – general development|publisher=The [[European Parliament]]|work=European Parliament Fact Sheets|access-date=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Parada Równości 2018 01.jpg|thumb|[[Parada Równości|Warsaw Pride]] 2018. Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights asserts that "any discrimination based on any ground such as [...] sexual orientation shall be prohibited."]]
Signing the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;and is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria.[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm Assembly.coe.int.] This is a political and not a legal requirement for membership. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175941/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta08%2FERES1610.htm |date=26 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the [[Council of Europe]] ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm Article 59.1 of the Convention]), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe]).&lt;/ref&gt; nor had the competence to accede.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on "Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms" [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994V0002:FR:NOT 1996 E.C.R. I-1759] (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.

The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Social Charter]], as well as the [[source of law]] for the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Policy on Death Penalty|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm|work=Europa|publisher=European Union External Action Service|access-date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious [[human rights violations]] and abuses around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://news.bloombergtax.com/international-trade/europe-unveils-new-sanctions-plan-for-human-rights-violations |title= Europe Unveils New Sanctions Plan for Human Rights Violations |access-date= 19 October 2020 |website= Bloomberg Tax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts===
{{see also|European Citizens' Initiative}}
The main legal acts of the European Union come in three forms: [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], and [[Decision (European Union)|decisions]]. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT &lt;nowiki&gt;[1973]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ECR 981].&lt;/ref&gt; and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="art249"/&gt; Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have [[direct effect]] in national law against member states.

Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in [[competition law]], or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|title=How EU takes decisions|access-date=1 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102215021/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archive-date=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Ombudsman===
The [[European Ombudsman]] was established by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. The [[ombudsman]] is elected by the [[European Parliament]] for the length of the parliament's term, and the position is renewable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20191212IPR68912/emily-o-reilly-re-elected-european-ombudsman|title=Emily O'Reilly re-elected European Ombudsman &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; European Parliament|date=18 December 2019|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any EU citizen or entity may appeal to the ombudsman to investigate an EU institution on the grounds of maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/es/areas-of-work|title=European Ombudsman|website=www.ombudsman.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily O'Reilly]] has been the ombudsman since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/es/emily-oreilly|title=European Ombudsman|website=www.ombudsman.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home affairs and migration==
{{Further|Area of freedom, security and justice|Citizenship of the European Union}}

Since the creation of the European Union in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs; initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. Accordingly, the union has legislated in areas such as [[European Arrest Warrant|extradition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; family law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33194_en.htm|title=Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (Brussels II)|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; asylum law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33150_en.htm|title=Minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l10110_en.htm|title=Specific Programme: 'Criminal Justice'|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="art39/141 Rome"&gt;See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="art2(7) Amsterdam"&gt;See Article 2(7) of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 eur-lex.europa.eu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217024604/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on [[sexism|sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[ageism|age discrimination]], and [[racism|racial discrimination]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, pp. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, pp. 16–22).&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecutorial and immigrations controls across the member states: [[Europol]] for co-operation of police forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European police office now in full swing |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurojust]] for co-operation between prosecutors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frontex]] for co-operation between border control authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Frontex?|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/|author=Frontex|publisher=Europa web portal|access-date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU also operates the [[Schengen Information System]]&lt;ref name="Internal borders"/&gt; which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the [[Schengen Agreement]] and the associated cross border crime.

Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the [[EU's common commercial policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm|access-date=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of [[European Political Cooperation]] which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the [[Single European Act]]. EPC was renamed as the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].&lt;ref name="EPC"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708111806/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date= 8 July 2007 |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm |title=European political co-operation (EPC) |access-date=3 September 2007 |publisher=Europa web portal |author=The European commission |work=Europa Glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.&lt;ref name="art11 Union"&gt;Article 21 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon), on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]].&lt;ref name="BBC Iraq statement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|work =BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 January 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|access-date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy]] who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The high representative heads up the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS), a unique EU department&lt;ref name="23Oct"&gt;Rettman, Andrew (23 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28878 EU states envisage new foreign policy giant], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt; that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European External Action Service gives Europe voice on world stage|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Meldungen/2010/101201-EAD.html|publisher=German Foreign Ministry|access-date=4 June 2013|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and [[diplomatic corps]] for the European Union.&lt;ref name="Europa EEAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=European External Action Service|publisher=Europa web portal|year=2010|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/background/index_en.htm|access-date=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=John|date=August 2008|title=Enlargement, reform and the European Commission.

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the [[European Council]] agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the [[EU Battlegroup]]s initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500&amp;nbsp;personnel.&lt;ref name="Council Capabilities"&gt;{{cite web|title=EU battlegroups |publisher=Europa web portal|author=Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/090720-Factsheet-Battlegroups_EN.pdf|date=July 2009|access-date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian aid===
{{Further|Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations}}

The [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department]], or "ECHO", provides [[humanitarian aid]] from the EU to [[developing country|developing countries]]. In 2012, its budget amounted to {{Euro|874}}{{nbsp}}million, 51 per cent of the budget went to Africa and 20 per cent to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20 per cent to the Middle East and Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ECHO's finances | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130718150202/http://ec.europa.eu/echo/funding/finances_en.htm | archive-date = 18 July 2013 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/echo/funding/finances_en.htm | website = ec.europa.eu | publisher = Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, [[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70 per cent) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the [[European Development Fund]] (30 per cent).&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;Mikaela Gavas 2010.

The European Union uses foreign relations instruments like the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a [[member state of the European Union]], or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.
[[File:Membreupm.png|thumb|right|[[Union for the Mediterranean]] meeting in Barcelona.]]
International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the [[Paris Agreement]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas – people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] – in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity.

EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the council, the European Parliament and the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european-consensus/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141039/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/development-policies/european-consensus/index_en.htm |archive-date=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is applied from the principles of [[Capability approach]] and [[Rights-based approach to development]].

Partnership and cooperation agreements are bilateral agreements with non-member nations.&lt;ref name="pca"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vh7gkuhng0wh|title=Partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) – EU monitor|website=www.eumonitor.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
The European Union is the largest exporter in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html |title=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2008 the largest importer of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/anrep_e/world_trade_report09_e.pdf| title= World trade report 2009|publisher=WTO information website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU position in world trade|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/|publisher=European Commission|access-date=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as [[tariff]]s and [[border control]]s. In the [[eurozone]], trade is helped by not having any currency differences to deal with amongst most members.&lt;ref name="Se-jeong"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/07/139_48696.html|title=EU-Korea FTA Will Be a Long Process: Greek Ambassador|last=Se-jeong|first=Kim|date=19 July 2009|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|access-date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Association Agreement]] does something similar for a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries.

===Internal market===
{{Main|European Single Market|Digital Single Market|European consumer law}}

Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a [[single market]], and a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its member states. The single market involves [[Internal market|the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU]],&lt;ref name="Europa Single Market"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Single Market |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |access-date=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001122551/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |archive-date= 1 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the customs union involves the application of a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or [[import quota]]s, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] participate in the single market but not in the customs union.&lt;ref name="EEA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/eea/ |title=The European Economic Area (EEA) |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |access-date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.&lt;ref name="Europa Single Market G"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for goods |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm |access-date=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621214532/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm |archive-date=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.&lt;ref name="Europa Single Market C"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm |access-date=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518000627/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm |archive-date=18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the drive towards [[economic and monetary union]] the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.

The free movement of persons means that [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.&lt;ref name="Europa Single Market P"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm |author=European Commission |access-date=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613212310/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm |archive-date=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60 per cent to 70 per cent of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the [[Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006]] which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.&lt;ref name="Europa Single Market S"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Services |publisher=Europa |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |author=European Commission |access-date=27 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610133514/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |archive-date=10 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

The creation of a [[European Currency Unit|European single currency]] became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] if they wanted to join the [[Currency union|monetary union]]. The states wanting to participate had first to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]].

In 1999, the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with [[History of the euro|eleven member states]] joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when [[euro banknotes|euro notes]] and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Almunia says 'undesirable' to act on Sweden's euro refusal |first1=Teresa |last1=Kuchler |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22733 |access-date=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;{{cite web|title=ERM II |publisher=Danish Finance Ministry |date=20 March 2009 |url=http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |access-date=26 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503183816/http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |archive-date=3 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|access-date=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls [[monetary policy]] in that area with an agenda to maintain [[price stability]]. It is at the centre of the [[European System of Central Banks]], which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]], who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states.&lt;ref name="ECB org"&gt;{{cite web|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|access-date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European System of Financial Supervision]] is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the [[European Banking Authority]], the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]. To complement this framework, there is also a [[European Systemic Risk Board]] under the responsibility of the central bank. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/?aid=30866|title=Europe seals deal on financial supervision|work=euobserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.

The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.&lt;ref name="Energy Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: EU energy plans |publisher=BBC |date=9 March 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm |access-date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the [[internal market]], encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia&lt;ref name="oies"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff|url=http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG25-KazakhstansgasExportMarketsandExportRoutes-ShamilYenikeyeff-2008.pdf|title=Kazakhstan's Gas: Export Markets and Export Routes|publisher=[[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]]|date=November 2008|access-date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing [[renewable energy commercialisation]]; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.&lt;ref name="Energy Q&amp;A"/&gt;

[[Rail transport in Europe]] is being synchronised with the [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS), an initiative to greatly enhance safety, increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in Europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitised mostly wireless versions and by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Paper on Transport|publisher=Euractiv|date=22 September 2004|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628|access-date=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Highways in Poland|Polish road network]] was upgraded such as the [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 autostrada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUR 650 million for the Polish Road Network|url=http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|access-date=25 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160259/http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|archive-date=19 January 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]] is another EU infrastructure project. Galileo is a proposed [[Satellite navigation]] system, to be built by the EU and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated [[Global Positioning System]], but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system.&lt;ref name="Barrot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrot|first=Jacques|title=Jacques Barrot Home Page, Commission vice president for transport|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/index_en.htm|access-date=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture and fisheries===
{{Main|Common Agricultural Policy}}
[[File:RO BZ Pietroasele vineyard.jpg|thumb|Vineyards in Romania; EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], the largest [[Budget of the European Union|budgetary]] expenditure.]]

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one of the long lasting policies of the European Community.&lt;ref name="stead"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|editor=Robert Whaples|title=Common Agricultural Policy|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=22 June 2007|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/common-agricultural-policy/|access-date=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Article 39 (ex Article 33) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131106072048/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AC%3A2010%3A083%3A0047%3A0200%3AEN%3APDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60 per cent of the then [[European Economic Community|European Community]]'s annual budget, and {{As of|2013|lc=y}} accounts for around 34 per cent.&lt;ref name="EU_CAP"&gt;{{cite web
|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129003403/http://europa.eu/pol/agr/index_en.htm |archive-date=29 November 2011 |url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/index_en.htm|title=Agriculture: Meeting the needs of farmers and consumers|date=26 August 2011|publisher=European Commission|quote=the common agricultural policy is the most integrated of all EU policies and consequently takes a large share of the EU budget. Nevertheless, its portion of the EU budget has dropped from a peak of nearly 70% in the 1970s to 34% over the 2007–2013 period.|work=Europa: Gateway to the European Union|access-date=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy's [[Incomes policy|price controls]] and market interventions led to considerable [[overproduction]]. These were [[Buffer stock scheme|intervention stores]] of products bought up by the community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the community and world prices) to export their products outside the community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the [[Third World|developing world]].&lt;ref name="Guardian CAP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1|access-date=30 August 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.&lt;ref name="Guardian CAP"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels.&lt;ref name="stead"/&gt; One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.&lt;ref name="EC CAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Europa|access-date=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===

The EU operates a [[European Union competition law|competition policy]] intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commissioner for Competition|European commissioner for competition]] (presently [[Margrethe Vestager]]) is one of the most powerful positions in the commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} For example, in 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States ([[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]]) which had already been approved by their national authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Europa web portal|title=The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell|date=3 July 2001|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/939|access-date=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another high-profile case [[European Union Microsoft competition case|against Microsoft]], resulted in the commission fining [[Microsoft]] over {{Euro|777}}&amp;nbsp;million following nine years of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gow|first=David|work=The Guardian |title=Microsoft caves in to European Commission|date=22 October 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/22/microsoft.microsoft|access-date=12 November 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour market===
The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent in September 2018.&lt;ref name="unemployment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teilm020&amp;tableSelection=1&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat – Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The euro area unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent.&lt;ref name="unemployment" /&gt; Among the member states, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3 per cent), Germany and Poland (both 3.4 per cent), and the highest in Spain (14.9 per cent) and Greece (19.0 in July 2018).&lt;ref name="unemployment" /&gt;

The European Union has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers rights and preventing social and environmental dumping. To this end it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the [[Working Time Directive]] and the [[Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011|Environmental Impact Assessment Directive]].

The EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states. Social security main legislation is found in the Equal Treatment in Occupational Social Security Directive 86/378, the Equal Treatment in Social Security Directive 79/7/EEC, the Social Security Regulation 1408/71/EC and 883/2004/EC and the Directive 2005/36/EC

The [[European Social Charter]] is the main body that recognizes the social rights of European citizens.

A [[European unemployment insurance]] has been proposed among others by the commissioner of Jobs [[Nicolas Schmit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/10114908/10/19/Asi-es-el-seguro-europeo-contra-el-paro-que-propone-el-futuro-comisario-de-Empleo-de-la-UE.html|title=Así es el seguro europeo contra el paro que propone el futuro comisario de Empleo de la UE – elEconomista.es|website=www.eleconomista.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; A European Directive about Minimum Wage has also been discussed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/proposed-eu-directive-on-minimum-wages-meets-with-sharply-mixed-reaction|title=Proposed EU directive on minimum wage brews controversy from all sides|date=3 December 2020|website=Expats.cz|last=Johnston|first=Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019 there has been a European commissioner for equality and the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] has existed since 2007.

In 2020, the first ever European Union Strategy on LGBTIQ equality was approved under [[Helena Dalli]] mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2068|title=Union of Equality: The Commission presents its first-ever strategy on LGBTIQ equality in the EU|website=[[European Commission]]|date=12 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing, youth, childhood, Functional diversity or elderly care are supportive competencies of the European Union and can be financed by the European Social Fund.

===Environment and climate===

[[File:European Union biogeography countries.svg|thumb|upright=1|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of the continental European Union, according to the [[European Environment Agency|European Environmental Agency]]]]

In 1957, when the European Economic Community was founded, it had no environmental policy.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and biotechnology.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} According to the [[Institute for European Environmental Policy]], environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.&lt;ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012"&gt;Institute for European Environmental Policy (2012) Manual of European Environmental Policy, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

European policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} [[Trade barrier]]s and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S.P. and Corcelle, G. (1989) The Environmental Policy of the European Communities, Graham &amp; Trotman, London&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.&lt;ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012"/&gt;

Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:l28027|title=EUR-Lex – l28027 – EN – EUR-Lex|publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.{{sfn|Jordan|Adelle|2012}} EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.&lt;ref name="European Environmental Policy 2012"/&gt;

Mitigating [[climate change]] is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20 per cent of the energy used across the EU must be [[renewable energy|renewable]], and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref name="EUO energy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1|title=EU sets 20% target for carbon cuts|access-date=29 February 2008|work=The Guardian |first=Jessica|last=Aldred|location=London|date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has adopted an [[Emissions trading|emissions trading system]] to incorporate [[carbon emissions]] into the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en|title=EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)|date=23 November 2016|website=Climate Action – European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Green Capital]] is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create [[smart city]].

In the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 elections to the European Parliament]], the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the rise of post materialist values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berman |first1=Sheri | author-link=Sheri Berman |title=Populists, greens and the new map of European politics |url=https://www.socialeurope.eu/populists-greens-new-political-map |website=Social Europe |access-date=21 June 2019|date=3 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in the European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018 – 2019. Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/21/eu-summit-deadlock-over-top-jobs-and-climate-discord |title = EU summit deadlock over top jobs and climate discord|date = 21 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[Erasmus Programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987.

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport policies of the European Union}}
[[Association football]] is by far the most popular sport in the European Union by the number of registered players. The other sports with the most participants in clubs are tennis, basketball, swimming, athletics, golf, gymnastics, equestrian sports, handball, volleyball and sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. van Bottenburg|author2=B.

Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]] that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.&lt;ref name="BBC Boseman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fordyce |first=Tom |title=10&amp;nbsp;years since Bosman|work=BBC News |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|access-date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[flag of Europe]] consists of a [[Circle of stars|circle of]] 12 golden stars on a blue background. Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the [[European Communities]], the predecessors of the present European Union, in 1986.
