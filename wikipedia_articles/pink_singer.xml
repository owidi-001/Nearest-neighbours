'''Alecia Beth Moore''' (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as '''Pink''' (stylized as '''{{nowrap|P!nk}}'''), is an American singer and songwriter. She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, [[LaFace Records]] saw potential in Pink and offered her a solo recording contract. Her [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]]-influenced debut studio album ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'' (2000) was certified [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]] in the United States and spawned two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten songs: "[[There You Go]]" and "[[Most Girls (Pink song)|Most Girls]]". She gained further recognition with the collaborative single "[[Lady Marmalade#Moulin Rouge! version|Lady Marmalade]]" from the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to [[pop rock]] with her second studio album ''[[Missundaztood]]'' (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs "[[Get the Party Started]]", "[[Don't Let Me Get Me]]", and "[[Just Like a Pill]]".

While Pink's third studio album, ''[[Try This]]'' (2003), sold significantly less than her previous work, it earned her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' (2006) and ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008), which spawned the top-ten entries "[[Who Knew]]" and "[[U + Ur Hand]]", as well as the number-one single "[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]". Pink's sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), was her first [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] number-one album and spawned her fourth US number-one single, "[[Just Give Me a Reason]]". In 2014, Pink recorded a collaborative album, ''[[Rose Ave. (album)|Rose Ave.]]'', with Canadian musician [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]] under a [[folk music]] duo named [[You+Me]]. Her next studio albums, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017) and ''[[Hurts 2B Human]]'' (2019), both debuted at atop the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, with the former becoming the world's third best-selling album of the year.

Pink was also the second most-played female solo artist in the United Kingdom during the 2000s decade, behind only [[Madonna]]. [[VH1]] ranked her at number ten on their list of the [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Music]], while ''Billboard'' awarded her the [[Billboard Women in Music|Woman of the Year]] award in 2013. At the 63rd annual [[BMI Award|BMI Pop Awards]], she received the BMI President's Award for "her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/2015_bmi_pop_awards|title = P!nk Receives President's Award at 63rd Annual BMI Pop Awards|work = BMI.com|access-date = August 9, 2015|date = May 13, 2015|publisher = Broadcast Music Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, "Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome."&lt;ref name="MTV Driven"&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/62882/episode_about.jhtml Driven: Pink] ''[[VH1]]''.

==Career==
===1995–1998: Career beginnings===
Pink began performing in [[Philadelphia]] clubs when she was about 14 years old. She adopted her stagename, "Pink", around this time. She had that nickname for quite some time by that point, and initially it had been "a mean thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Quote_of_the_Day_Pink_on_how_she_got_her_name_/1099188 |date=December 21, 2001 |title= Pink on how she got her name |work= Hollywood.com |access-date=October 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502002127/http://www.hollywood.com/news/Quote_of_the_Day_Pink_on_how_she_got_her_name_/1099188|archive-date=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took that name from the character "Mr. Pink" in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/artistsls/p/pink.htm |title = Pink Biography – Profile of pop singer Pink |work= Top40.about.com |date= September 8, 1979 |access-date=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 16, Pink and two other teenage girls, Sharon Flanagan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Note: Stephanie Galligan is named as "Sharon Flanagan" in certainsources|url= http://8tracks.com/explore/songs/Choice+No+Second|website=8tracks.com|access-date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chrissy Conway]], formed the R&amp;B group Choice. A copy of their first song, "Key to My Heart", was sent to [[LaFace Records]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where [[L.A. Reid]] overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. After that, he signed them to a record deal. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to Atlanta and recorded an album, which was never released, but "Key to My Heart" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film ''[[Kazaam]]''. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: go solo or go home. Choice disbanded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/pink-562098|title= Pink|website= Biography.com| access-date= October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999–2002: ''Can't Take Me Home'' and ''Missundaztood''===
After Choice disbanded, Pink signed a recording contract with LaFace Records and began working on her debut solo album with producers such as [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], [[Kandi Burruss]] and [[Tricky Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelavalizard.com/2012/09/music-minute-421/ |title=Music Minute: Pink's Low Debut! |website=The Lava Lizard |access-date=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930014330/http://thelavalizard.com/2012/09/music-minute-421/ |archive-date=September 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut single, "[[There You Go]]", was released in February 2000 and became her first top-ten hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, where it peaked at number seven.&lt;ref name="billboardsingles"&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=p!nk|chart=Hot 100}}|title=Raise Your Glass: Pink|work=Billboard|access-date=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the song also charted inside the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="chartarchive28252"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Disillusion|title=The Official Charts Company – Disillusion by Badly Drawn Boy Search|date=May 6, 2013|website=officialcharts.com|publisher=The Official Charts Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Pink's debut album, ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'', was released to commercial success.

On August 21, 2018, Pink stopped her concert in Brisbane for a grieving fan. A girl named Leah lost her mother one month prior to the concert, and she and her family hung up signs all around the concert, saying "My name is Leah – I'm 14 years old. I lost my beautiful Mum last month. I would LOVE a hug... Please!". The signs grabbed the attention of Pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 21, 2018 |url=https://www.mamamia.com.au/pink-brisbane-concert/ |title=The beautiful moment Pink stopped her Aussie concert to comfort a grieving teen fan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It inspires people... This is a prolific pop artist who is sometimes famous and successful, sometimes obscure, who nonetheless keeps making her own kind of music."&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

James Montgomery of [[MTV]] describes her as "a fabulously fearless pop artist" who can "out-sing almost anyone out there. She can out-crazy [[Lady Gaga|Gaga]] or [[Lily Allen|Lily]]. She's the total pop-star package, everything you'd want in a singer/entertainer/icon. And still, she remains oddly off the radar. Such is the price of busting borders".&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said: "She essentially invented the whole modern wave of Pop Diva Domination: You can draw a straight line from "Get This Party Started" to Katy Perry, Kesha, pre-messianic Lady Gaga, and post-weird Rihanna."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franich|first=Darren|title=Who should judge 'American Idol'?|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/04/26/american-idol-new-judges-panel/2/|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Glamour Magazine]]'' wrote: "When Pennsylvania-born Alecia Moore debuted in 2000, pop was dominated by long-locked blonds like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and [[Jessica Simpson]].

Following her performance at the [[American Music Awards of 2012]], LZ Granderson of [[CNN]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"... our culture's biggest sin may well be the auto-tuned syrup we've allowed to dominate the pop charts. All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the [[Black Eyed Peas]] and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift [...] But thank God for Pink. [...]  While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, [[Britney Spears]] can't sing, and [[Lauryn Hill]] sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year career by being something that is incredibly rare these days—an artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Granderson|first=LZ|title=Pink, a true pop artist|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/20/opinion/granderson-pink-music|work=CNN|access-date=March 9, 2013|date=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
British soul singer [[Adele]] considers Pink's performance at [[Brixton Academy]] in London as one of "the most defining moments" in her life, saying "It was the ''[[Missundaztood]]'' record, so I was about 13 or 14.

Pink met professional [[motocross]] racer [[Carey Hart]] at the 2001 [[X Games]] in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] motocross race; she was "assisting" in his race and wrote "Will You Marry Me? I'm serious!" on a pit board. He initially did not notice and continued on for another lap. When he did notice later, he veered off the track to accept right then. She then made him finish the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://society.ezinemark.com/pinks-most-amazing-rockin-moments-7736ccedb94a.html|title=Pink's Most Amazing Rockin' Moments|access-date=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709000733/http://society.ezinemark.com/pinks-most-amazing-rockin-moments-7736ccedb94a.html|archive-date=July 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sFKhYEsIcU |title=Pink &amp; Carey (2006)|work=YouTube |access-date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in [[Costa Rica]] on January 7, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1145831,00.html "Pink Marries Boyfriend in Costa Rica"], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', January 7, 2006.
