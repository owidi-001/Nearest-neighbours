&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''stroke''' is a [[disease|medical condition]] in which poor [[cerebral circulation|blood flow]] to the [[brain]] causes [[cell death]].&lt;ref name=HLB2014W/&gt; There are two main types of stroke: [[brain ischemia|ischemic]], due to lack of blood flow, and [[intracranial hemorrhage|hemorrhagic]], due to [[bleeding]].&lt;ref name=HLB2014W/&gt; Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.&lt;ref name=HLB2014W&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Stroke?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/stroke|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov/|access-date=26 February 2015|date=March 26, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218230259/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/stroke/|archive-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an [[hemiplegia|inability to move or feel]] on one side of the body, [[receptive aphasia|problems understanding]] or [[expressive aphasia|speaking]], [[dizziness]], or [[Homonymous hemianopsia|loss of vision to one side]].&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=HLB2014S/&gt; Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred.&lt;ref name=HLB2014S/&gt; If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA), also called a  mini-stroke.&lt;ref name=HLB2014S&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Stroke?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/stroke/signs|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=27 February 2015|date=March 26, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227083736/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/stroke/signs|archive-date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[subarachnoid hemorrhage|hemorrhagic stroke]] may also be associated with a [[thunderclap headache|severe headache]].&lt;ref name=HLB2014S/&gt; The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent.&lt;ref name=HLB2014W/&gt; Long-term complications may include [[pneumonia]] and [[Urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]].&lt;ref name=HLB2014S/&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:Ischemic Stroke.svg|thumb|There are two main categories of strokes. Ischemic (top), typically caused by a blood clot in an artery (1a) resulting in brain death to the affected area (2a). Hemorrhagic (bottom), caused by blood leaking into or around the brain from a ruptured blood vessel (1b) allowing blood to pool in the affected area (2b) thus increasing the pressure on the brain.]]
[[File:MCA-Stroke-Brain-Human-2.JPG|thumb|A slice of brain from the autopsy of a person who had an acute [[middle cerebral artery|middle cerebral artery (MCA)]] stroke]]
Strokes can be classified into two major categories: [[ischemia|ischemic]] and [[bleeding|hemorrhagic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/preventing_stroke.htm|title=Brain Basics: Preventing Stroke|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|access-date=2009-10-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008203200/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/preventing_stroke.htm|archive-date=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ischemic strokes are caused by [[Perfusion#Malperfusion|interruption of the blood supply]] to the brain, while hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a [[blood vessel]] or an [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation|abnormal vascular structure]]. About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as "hemorrhagic transformation." It is unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic strokes.&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt;

===Definition===
In the 1970s the [[World Health Organization]] defined stroke as a "neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organisation|title=Cerebrovascular Disorders (Offset Publications) |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year= 1978|isbn=978-92-4-170043-6 |oclc= 4757533}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the word "stroke" is centuries old. This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from [[transient ischemic attack]], which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt; With the availability of treatments that can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as brain attack and acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (modeled after [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[acute coronary syndrome]], respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kidwell CS, Warach S | title = Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome: diagnostic criteria | journal = Stroke | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = 2995–8 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14605325 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000098902.69855.A9 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ischemic===
{{Main|Cerebral infarction|Brain ischemia}}

In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:

# [[Thrombosis]] (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally)
# [[Embolism]] (obstruction due to an [[embolus]] from elsewhere in the body),&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt;
# Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shuaib A, Hachinski VC | title = Mechanisms and management of stroke in the elderly | journal = CMAJ | volume = 145 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–43 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1878825 | pmc = 1335826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]].&lt;ref name=Stam2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stam J | title = Thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 17 | pages = 1791–8 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15858188 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra042354 | url = http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/thrombosis-of-the-cerebral-veins-and-sinuses(86f1380e-2fad-4435-8086-29c69dec3300).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stroke without an obvious explanation is termed [[idiopathic disease|cryptogenic]] (of unknown origin); this constitutes 30–40% of all ischemic strokes.&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guercini&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guercini F, Acciarresi M, Agnelli G, Paciaroni M | title = Cryptogenic stroke: time to determine aetiology | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 549–54 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18208534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02903.x | s2cid = 20211745 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as [[total anterior circulation infarct]] (TACI), [[partial anterior circulation infarct]] (PACI), [[lacunar infarct]] (LACI) or [[posterior circulation infarct]] (POCI).

===Hemorrhagic===
{{Main|Intracerebral hemorrhage|Subarachnoid hemorrhage}}
[[File:Parachemableedwithedema.png|thumb|[[CT scan]] of an intraparenchymal bleed (bottom arrow) with surrounding edema (top arrow)]]
There are two main types of hemorrhagic stroke:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anonymous|title=Hemorrhagic stroke|url=http://www.stroke.org/understand-stroke/what-stroke/hemorrhagic-stroke|publisher=National Stroke Association|access-date=30 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627175524/http://www.stroke.org/understand-stroke/what-stroke/hemorrhagic-stroke|archive-date=27 June 2016|date=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anonymous|title=Types of Stroke|url=https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/types_of_stroke.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|publisher=Centers of Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=30 June 2016|date=6 December 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627061518/http://www.cdc.gov/stroke/types_of_stroke.htm|archive-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intracerebral hemorrhage]], which is basically bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] (bleeding within the brain tissue) or [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] (bleeding within the brain's [[ventricular system]]).
* [[Subarachnoid hemorrhage]], which is basically bleeding that occurs outside of the brain tissue but still within the skull, and precisely between the [[arachnoid mater]] and [[pia mater]] (the delicate ''innermost'' layer of the three layers of the [[meninges]] that surround the brain).
The above two main types of hemorrhagic stroke are also two different forms of [[intracranial hemorrhage]], which is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the [[cranial vault]]; but the other forms of intracranial hemorrhage, such as [[epidural hematoma]] (bleeding between the skull and the [[dura mater]], which is the thick ''outermost'' layer of the meninges that surround the brain) and [[subdural hematoma]] (bleeding in the [[subdural space]]), are not considered "hemorrhagic strokes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Shahi Salman R, Labovitz DL, Stapf C | title = Spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage | journal = BMJ | volume = 339 | issue = jul24 1 | pages = b2586 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19633038 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b2586 | s2cid = 206891608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemorrhagic strokes may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as [[cerebral amyloid angiopathy]], [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation]] and an [[intracranial aneurysm]], which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In addition to neurological impairment, hemorrhagic strokes usually cause specific symptoms (for instance, subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes a severe [[headache]] known as a [[thunderclap headache]]) or reveal evidence of a previous [[head injury]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms.  For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with a [[headache]], apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Early recognition===
Various systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke. Different findings are able to predict the presence or absence of stroke to different degrees. Sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift (i.e., if a person, when asked to raise both arms, involuntarily lets one arm drift downward) and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke, increasing the likelihood by 5.5 when at least one of these is present.  Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is decreased (– [[likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]] of 0.39).&lt;ref name="pmid15900010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldstein LB, Simel DL | title = Is this patient having a stroke? | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 19 | pages = 2391–402 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15900010 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.19.2391 | s2cid = 20408776 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1ffbcf0c742c62d63ac0d490d716bf9b2fe52352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting.
[[File:CDC video about stroke emergency treatment.ogg|thumb|A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] public service announcement on emergency medical treatment after or during a stroke from 2021.]]
A mnemonic to remember the warning signs of stroke is [[FAST (stroke)|FAST]] (facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call emergency services),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harbison J, Massey A, Barnett L, Hodge D, Ford GA | title = Rapid ambulance protocol for acute stroke | journal = The Lancet | volume = 353 | issue = 9168 | pages = 1935 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10371574 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00966-6 | s2cid = 36692451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as advocated by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)]] and the [[Stroke Association]], the [[American Stroke Association]], the [[National Stroke Association]] (US), the [[Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kidwell CS, Saver JL, Schubert GB, Eckstein M, Starkman S | title = Design and retrospective analysis of the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) | journal = Prehospital Emergency Care | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 267–73 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9799012 | doi = 10.1080/10903129808958878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cincinnati Stroke Scale|Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale]] (CPSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kothari RU, Pancioli A, Liu T, Brott T, Broderick J | title = Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale: reproducibility and validity | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 373–8 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10092713 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(99)70299-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.&lt;ref name=NICECG68&gt;{{NICE|68|Stroke|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAST is less reliable in the recognition of posterior circulation strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merwick Á, Werring D | title = Posterior circulation ischaemic stroke | journal = BMJ | volume = 348 | issue = may19 33 | pages = g3175 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24842277 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g3175 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people referred to the [[emergency room]], early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination.&lt;ref name=NICECG68/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nor AM, Davis J, Sen B, Shipsey D, Louw SJ, Dyker AG, Davis M, Ford GA | display-authors = 6 | title = The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument | journal = The Lancet.

===Subtypes===
If the area of the brain affected includes one of the three prominent [[Neural pathway|central nervous system pathways]]—the [[spinothalamic tract]], [[corticospinal tract]], and the [[dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway]], symptoms may include:
* [[hemiplegia]] and [[central facial palsy|muscle weakness of the face]]
* numbness
* reduction in sensory or vibratory sensation
* initial [[flaccidity]] (reduced muscle tone), replaced by [[spasticity]] (increased muscle tone), [[hyperreflexia|excessive reflexes]], and obligatory synergies.&lt;ref name=OSul07_719&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Susan.B | title = Physical Rehabilitation | chapter = Stroke | volume = 5 |editor= O'Sullivan, S.B. |editor2=Schmitz, T.J. | publisher = F.A. Davis Company | year = 2007 | location = Philadelphia | page = 719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body (unilateral).  Depending on the part of the brain affected,  the defect in the brain is ''usually'' on the [[contralateral|opposite side]] of the body.  However, since these pathways also travel in the [[spinal cord]] and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily indicate a stroke. In addition to the above CNS pathways, the ''[[brainstem]]'' gives rise to most of the twelve [[cranial nerves]]. A [[brainstem stroke syndrome|brainstem stroke]] affecting the brainstem and brain, therefore, can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision (total or partial)
* drooping of eyelid ([[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]) and weakness of [[Extraocular muscles|ocular muscles]]
* decreased reflexes: gag, swallow, pupil reactivity to light
* decreased sensation and muscle weakness of the face
* [[Balance disorder|balance problems]] and [[nystagmus]]
* altered breathing and heart rate
* weakness in [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] with inability to turn head to one side
* weakness in tongue (inability to stick out the tongue or move it from side to side)

If the ''[[cerebral cortex]]'' is involved, the CNS pathways can again be affected, but also can produce the following symptoms:
* [[aphasia]] (difficulty with verbal expression, auditory comprehension, [[Alexia (condition)|reading]] and [[Agraphia|writing]];  [[Broca's area|Broca's]] or [[Wernicke's area]] typically involved)
* [[dysarthria]] ([[motor speech disorders|motor speech disorder]] resulting from neurological injury)
* [[apraxia]] (altered voluntary movements)
* [[visual field]] defect
* memory deficits (involvement of [[temporal lobe]])
* [[hemineglect]] (involvement of [[parietal lobe]])
* disorganized thinking, confusion, [[hypersexual]] gestures (with involvement of frontal lobe)
* [[anosognosia|lack of insight]] of his or her, usually stroke-related, disability

If the ''[[cerebellum]]'' is involved, [[Ataxia#Cerebellar|ataxia]] might be present and this includes:
* altered walking [[Gait abnormality|gait]]
* altered [[motor coordination|movement coordination]]
* [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and or disequilibrium

===Associated symptoms===
[[Unconsciousness|Loss of consciousness]], headache, and vomiting usually occur more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased [[intracranial pressure]] from the leaking blood compressing the brain.

If symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke.

==Causes==

===Thrombotic stroke===
[[File:Blausen 0836 Stroke.png|thumb|Illustration of an embolic stroke, showing a blockage lodged in a blood vessel.]]
In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18120.htm|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|work=MedlinePlus|title=Thrombus|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701151141/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18120.htm|archive-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (blood clot) usually forms around [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower than that of a hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an [[embolus]]. Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke:
* ''Large vessel disease'' involves the [[Common carotid artery|common]] and [[internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]], the [[vertebral artery]], and the [[Circle of Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strokecenter.org/professionals/brain-anatomy/blood-vessels-of-the-brain/|publisher=The Internet Stroke Center|title=Circle of Willis|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205102902/http://www.strokecenter.org/professionals/brain-anatomy/blood-vessels-of-the-brain/|archive-date=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases that may form [[thrombi]] in the large vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, [[vasoconstriction]] (tightening of the artery), [[Aortic dissection|aortic]], [[carotid artery dissection|carotid]] or [[vertebral artery dissection]], various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall ([[Takayasu arteritis]], [[giant cell arteritis]], [[vasculitis]]), noninflammatory vasculopathy, [[Moyamoya disease]] and [[fibromuscular dysplasia]].
* ''[[Small vessel disease]]'' involves the smaller arteries inside the brain: branches of the [[circle of Willis]], middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and [[basilar artery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aneurysm/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=[[National Health Service|NHS]] Choices|title=Brain anaurysm – Introduction|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208185638/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aneurysm/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archive-date=2016-02-08|date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): [[lipohyalinosis]] (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel as a result of high blood pressure and aging) and [[fibrinoid degeneration]] (a stroke involving these vessels is known as a [[lacunar stroke]]) and microatheroma (small atherosclerotic plaques).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher CM | title = The arterial lesions underlying lacunes | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = December 1968 | pmid = 5708546 | doi = 10.1007/BF00685305 | s2cid = 6942826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sickle-cell disease|Sickle-cell anemia]], which can cause [[blood cell]]s to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead to stroke. A stroke is the second leading cause of death in people under 20 with sickle-cell anemia.&lt;ref name="NINDS1999"/&gt; [[Air pollution]] may also increase stroke risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah AS, Lee KK, McAllister DA, Hunter A, Nair H, Whiteley W, Langrish JP, Newby DE, Mills NL | display-authors = 6 | title = Short term exposure to air pollution and stroke: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 350 | issue = mar23 11 | pages = h1295 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25810496 | pmc = 4373601 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.h1295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embolic stroke===
An embolic stroke refers to an [[arterial embolism]] (a blockage of an artery) by an [[embolus]], a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including [[fat embolism|fat]] (e.g., from [[bone marrow]] in a [[Bone fracture|broken bone]]), air, [[cancer]] cells or clumps of [[bacteria]] (usually from infectious [[endocarditis]]).&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;

Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, the source of the embolus must be identified. Because the embolic blockage is sudden in onset, symptoms usually are maximal at the start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.

Emboli most commonly arise from the [[heart]] (especially in [[atrial fibrillation]]) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In [[paradoxical embolism]], a [[deep vein thrombosis]] embolizes through an [[atrial septal defect|atrial]] or [[ventricular septal defect]] in the heart into the brain.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite book|first= Vinay | last = Kumar | name-list-style = vanc |title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, Professional Edition.|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4377-0792-2|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes of stroke related to the heart can be distinguished between high and low-risk:&lt;ref name="ay"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ay H, Furie KL, Singhal A, Smith WS, Sorensen AG, Koroshetz WJ | title = An evidence-based causative classification system for acute ischemic stroke | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 688–97 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16240340 | doi = 10.1002/ana.20617 | s2cid = 28798146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High risk: atrial fibrillation and [[paroxysmal atrial fibrillation]], [[Rheumatic fever|rheumatic disease]] of the [[mitral valve|mitral]] or [[aortic valve]] disease, [[artificial heart valve]]s, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, [[sick sinus syndrome]], sustained [[atrial flutter]], recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with [[ejection fraction]] &lt;28 percent, symptomatic [[congestive heart failure]] with ejection fraction &lt;30 percent, [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], [[Libman-Sacks endocarditis]], [[Marantic endocarditis]], [[infective endocarditis]], [[papillary fibroelastoma]], [[atrial myxoma|left atrial myxoma]] and [[coronary artery bypass graft]] (CABG) surgery.
* Low risk/potential: calcification of the annulus (ring) of the mitral valve, patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal aneurysm, atrial septal aneurysm ''with'' patent foramen ovale, left ventricular aneurysm without thrombus, isolated left atrial "smoke" on [[echocardiography]] (no [[mitral stenosis]] or atrial fibrillation), complex atheroma in the [[ascending aorta]] or proximal arch.

Among those who have a complete blockage of one of the carotid arteries, the risk of stroke on that side is about one percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hackam DG | title = Prognosis of Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Occlusion: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Stroke | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 1253–7 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27073237 | doi = 10.1161/strokeaha.116.012760 | s2cid = 3669224 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special form of embolic stroke is the [[embolic stroke of undetermined source]] (ESUS). This subset of cryptogenic stroke is defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. About one out of six ischemic strokes could be classified as ESUS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart RG, Catanese L, Perera KS, Ntaios G, Connolly SJ | title = Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source: A Systematic Review and Clinical Update | journal = Stroke | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 867–872 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28265016 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.016414 | s2cid = 3679562 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebral hypoperfusion===
[[Shock (circulatory)|Cerebral hypoperfusion]] is the reduction of blood flow to all parts of the brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to [[heart failure]] from [[cardiac arrest]] or arrhythmias, or from reduced [[cardiac output]] as a result of [[myocardial infarction]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pericardial effusion]], or bleeding.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxemia]] (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable "watershed" areas—border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A [[watershed stroke]] refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.

===Venous thrombosis===
[[Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]] leads to stroke due to locally increased venous pressure, which exceeds the pressure generated by the arteries. Infarcts are more likely to undergo hemorrhagic transformation (leaking of blood into the damaged area) than other types of ischemic stroke.&lt;ref name=Stam2005/&gt;

===Intracerebral hemorrhage===
It generally occurs in small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hypertension|journal=Journal of Hypertension|volume=14|issue=3|pages=S23–S27|date=October 1996|last1=Strandgaard|first1=Svend|doi=10.1097/00004872-199610003-00005|pmid=9120662|s2cid=11817729}}&lt;/ref&gt; intracranial vascular malformations (including [[cavernous angioma]]s or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s), cerebral [[amyloid angiopathy]], or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred.&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt; Other potential causes are trauma, [[Hemophilia|bleeding disorders]], [[amyloid angiopathy]], [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]] (e.g., amphetamines or [[cocaine]]). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the [[ventricular system]], [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a [[mortality rate]] of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (which technically may also be classified as a type of stroke&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt;).

===Other===
Other causes may include spasm of an artery. This may occur due to [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrigan|first1=Mark R.|last2=Deveikis|first2=John P.| name-list-style = vanc |title=Handbook of Cerebrovascular Disease and Neurointerventional Technique|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-61779-945-7|page=692|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUh1JA82zCMC&amp;pg=PA692|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109020750/https://books.google.com/books?id=aUh1JA82zCMC&amp;pg=PA692|archive-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silent stroke===
A [[silent stroke]] is a stroke that does not have any outward symptoms, and people are typically unaware they have had a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still damages the brain and places the person at increased risk for both [[transient ischemic attack]] and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have had a major stroke are also at risk of having silent strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miwa K, Hoshi T, Hougaku H, Tanaka M, Furukado S, Abe Y, Okazaki S, Sakaguchi M, Sakoda S, Kitagawa K | display-authors = 6 | title = Silent cerebral infarction is associated with incident stroke and TIA independent of carotid intima-media thickness | journal = Internal Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 817–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20453400 | doi = 10.2169/internalmedicine.49.3211 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these strokes were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or [[hemorrhage]]s.

==Pathophysiology==

===Ischemic===

There is slight edema and loss of normal architecture in the surrounding [[neuropil]].]]
Ischemic stroke occurs because of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the [[ischemic cascade]].&lt;ref name=Deb&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deb P, Sharma S, Hassan KM | title = Pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute ischemic stroke: An overview with emphasis on therapeutic significance beyond thrombolysis | journal = Pathophysiology | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–218 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20074922 | doi = 10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds{{Citation needed|reason=A reference that shows this opens possibilities for further research, and, as it stands, it is not verifiable.|date=October 2016}}, and after approximately three hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading to the death of the tissue, i.e., [[infarction]]. (This is why fibrinolytics such as [[alteplase]] are given only until three hours since the onset of the stroke.) Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small [[emboli]] through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Richard S. Snell|title= Clinical neuroanatomy, 6. ed |publisher=  Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia|pages= 478–85|isbn= 978-963-226-293-2 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts to using [[anaerobic metabolism]] within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) but releases a by-product called [[lactic acid]]. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area is referred to as the "ischemic [[penumbra (medicine)|penumbra]]".&lt;ref&gt;Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook on Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

As oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of [[high energy phosphate]] compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy-dependent processes (such as ion pumping) necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. A major cause of neuronal injury is the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The concentration of glutamate outside the cells of the nervous system is normally kept low by so-called uptake carriers, which are powered by the concentration gradients of ions (mainly Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) across the cell membrane. However, stroke cuts off the supply of oxygen and glucose which powers the ion pumps maintaining these gradients. As a result, the transmembrane ion gradients run down, and glutamate transporters reverse their direction, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Glutamate acts on receptors in nerve cells (especially NMDA receptors), producing an influx of calcium which activates enzymes that digest the cells' proteins, lipids, and nuclear material. Calcium influx can also lead to the failure of [[mitochondria]], which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]].&lt;ref name="PMID8761323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kristián T, Siesjö BK | title = Calcium-related damage in ischemia | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 59 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 357–67 | date = 1996 | pmid = 8761323 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(96)00314-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ischemia also induces production of [[Radical (chemistry)|oxygen free radicals]] and other [[reactive oxygen species]]. These react with and damage a number of cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium is particularly important. In fact, many antioxidant neuroprotectants such as [[uric acid]] and [[NXY-059]] work at the level of the endothelium and not in the brain ''per se''. Free radicals also directly initiate elements of the programmed cell death cascade by means of [[redox signaling]].&lt;ref name="PMID11149664"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan PH | title = Reactive oxygen radicals in signaling and damage in the ischemic brain | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–14 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11149664 | doi = 10.1097/00004647-200101000-00002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes are the same for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the ''ischemic cascade''. However, brain tissue is especially vulnerable to ischemia since it has little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on [[aerobic metabolism]], unlike most other organs.

In addition to damaging effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction can result in loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, [[Hyaluronan|hyaluronic acid]], and other elements of [[connective tissue]]. Other proteases also contribute to this process. The loss of vascular structural integrity results in a breakdown of the protective [[blood brain barrier]] that contributes to [[cerebral edema]], which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Hemorrhagic===
Hemorrhagic strokes are classified based on their underlying pathology. Some causes of hemorrhagic stroke are [[Hypertensive|hypertensive hemorrhage]], ruptured [[aneurysm]], ruptured [[AV fistula]], transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug-induced [[bleeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Longo |first1=Dan L. |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |year=2012 |edition=18th |page=370 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-174889-6 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding [[hematoma]] or hematomas. In addition, the pressure may lead to a loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting [[infarction]], and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and [[vasculature]].&lt;ref name="NINDS1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J | title = Preclinical and clinical research on inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–77 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20713126 | pmc = 2991407 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inflammation]] contributes to the [[secondary brain injury]] after hemorrhage.&lt;ref name="Wang 2010"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the [[NIHSS]]), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or [[MRI scan]]s, [[Doppler ultrasound]], and [[arteriography]]. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with assistance from the imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used [[blood test]] for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke.&lt;ref name="hill2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill MD | title = Diagnostic biomarkers for stroke: a stroke neurologist's perspective | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 51 | issue = 11 | pages = 2001–2 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16244286 | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2005.056382 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In deceased people, an [[autopsy of stroke]] may help establishing the time between stroke onset and death.

===Physical examination===
A [[physical examination]], including taking a [[medical history]] of the symptoms and a neurological status, helps giving an evaluation of the location and severity of a stroke. It can give a standard score on e.g., the [[NIH stroke scale]].

===Imaging===
For diagnosing ischemic (blockage) stroke in the emergency setting:&lt;ref name="pmid17258669"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalela JA, Kidwell CS, Nentwich LM, Luby M, Butman JA, Demchuk AM, Hill MD, Patronas N, Latour L, Warach S | display-authors = 6 | title = Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in emergency assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke: a prospective comparison | journal = The Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9558 | pages = 293–8 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17258669 | pmc = 1859855 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60151-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: sensitivity= 89%
: specificity= 100%
* MRI scan

For detecting chronic hemorrhages, MRI scan is more sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid15494579"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kidwell CS, Chalela JA, Saver JL, Starkman S, Hill MD, Demchuk AM, Butman JA, Patronas N, Alger JR, Latour LL, Luby ML, Baird AE, Leary MC, Tremwel M, Ovbiagele B, Fredieu A, Suzuki S, Villablanca JP, Davis S, Dunn B, Todd JW, Ezzeddine MA, Haymore J, Lynch JK, Davis L, Warach S | display-authors = 6 | title = Comparison of MRI and CT for detection of acute intracerebral hemorrhage | journal = JAMA | volume = 292 | issue = 15 | pages = 1823–30 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15494579 | doi = 10.1001/jama.292.15.1823 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the assessment of stable stroke, nuclear medicine scans SPECT and PET/CT may be helpful. SPECT documents cerebral blood flow and PET with FDG isotope the metabolic activity of the neurons.

CT scans may not detect an ischemic stroke, especially if it is small, of recent onset, or in the brainstem or cerebellum areas. A CT scan is more to ''rule out'' certain stroke mimics and detect bleeding.&lt;ref name=AFP2009/&gt;

===Underlying cause===
[[File:Left MCA Stroke.png|thumb|12-lead ECG of a patient with a stroke, showing large deeply inverted [[T wave|T-waves]]. Various ECG changes may occur in people with strokes and other brain disorders.]]
When a stroke has been diagnosed, various other studies may be performed to determine the underlying cause. With the current treatment and diagnosis options available, it is of particular importance to determine whether there is a peripheral source of emboli. Test selection may vary since the cause of stroke varies with age, [[comorbidity]] and the clinical presentation. The following are commonly used techniques:
* an [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound/doppler study]] of the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]] (to detect [[carotid stenosis]]) or dissection of the precerebral arteries;
* an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) and [[echocardiogram]] (to identify [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]] and resultant clots in the heart which may spread to the brain vessels through the bloodstream);
* a [[Holter monitor]] study to identify intermittent [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]];
* an [[angiogram]] of the cerebral vasculature (if a bleed is thought to have originated from an [[aneurysm]] or [[arteriovenous malformation]]);
* blood tests to determine if [[hypercholesterolemia|blood cholesterol is high]], if there is an abnormal [[bleeding diathesis|tendency to bleed]], and if some rarer processes such as [[homocysteinuria|homocystinuria]] might be involved.

For hemorrhagic strokes, a [[Computed tomography angiography|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRI scan with intravascular contrast]] may be able to identify abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive [[cerebral angiography]] could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations.&lt;ref name=Wilson2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson D, Adams ME, Robertson F, Murphy M, Werring DJ | title = Investigating intracerebral haemorrhage | journal = BMJ | volume = 350 | issue = may20 10 | pages = h2484 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994363 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.h2484 | s2cid = 26908106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis|venous thrombosis]], CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.&lt;ref name=Wilson2015/&gt;

===Misdiagnosis===

Among people with ischemic strokes, misdiagnosis occurs 2 to 26% of the time.&lt;ref name=Bak2018/&gt; A "stroke chameleon" (SC) is stroke which is diagnosed as something else.&lt;ref name=Bak2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakradze E, Liberman AL | title = Diagnostic Error in Stroke-Reasons and Proposed Solutions | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 11 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29441421 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-018-0712-3 | s2cid = 3335617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stroke chameleons, Dupre et. al, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupre CM, Libman R, Dupre SI, Katz JM, Rybinnik I, Kwiatkowski T | title = Stroke chameleons | journal = Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 374–8 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 23954604 | doi = 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2013.07.015 | orig-year = Available online 15 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People not having a stroke may also be misdiagnosed as a stroke. Giving thrombolytics (clot-busting) in such cases causes intracerebral bleeding 1 to 2% of the time, which is less than that of people with strokes. This unnecessary treatment adds to health care costs. Even so, the AHA/ASA guidelines state that starting intravenous tPA in possible mimics is preferred to delaying treatment for additional testing.&lt;ref name=Bak2018/&gt;

Women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders are more often misdiagnosed for a condition other than stroke when in fact having a stroke. In addition, adults under 44 years-of-age are seven times more likely to have a stroke missed than are adults over 75 years-of-age. This is especially the case for younger people with posterior circulation infarcts.&lt;ref name=Bak2018/&gt; Some medical centers have used hyperacute MRI in experimental studies for persons initially thought to have a low likelihood of stroke. And in some of these persons, strokes have been found which were then treated with thrombolytic medication.&lt;ref name=Bak2018/&gt;

==Prevention==
Given the disease burden of strokes, [[Prevention (medical)|prevention]] is an important [[public health]] concern.&lt;ref name="pmid12234233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Straus SE, Majumdar SR, McAlister FA | title = New evidence for stroke prevention: scientific review | journal = JAMA | volume = 288 | issue = 11 | pages = 1388–95 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12234233 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.11.1388 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary prevention]] is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the [[number needed to treat]] to prevent one stroke per year).&lt;ref name="pmid12234233"/&gt; Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke.&lt;ref name="PreventionGuidelines"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldstein LB, Adams R, Alberts MJ, Appel LJ, Brass LM, Bushnell CD, Culebras A, Degraba TJ, Gorelick PB, Guyton JR, Hart RG, Howard G, Kelly-Hayes M, Nixon JV, Sacco RL | display-authors = 6 | title = Primary prevention of ischemic stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Stroke Council: cosponsored by the Atherosclerotic Peripheral Vascular Disease Interdisciplinary Working Group; Cardiovascular Nursing Council; Clinical Cardiology Council; Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism Council; and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group: the American Academy of Neurology affirms the value of this guideline | journal = Stroke | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 1583–633 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16675728 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000223048.70103.F1 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Information for Consumers (Drugs) - Use of Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Heart Attack and Stroke|url = https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm390574.htm|website = www.fda.gov|access-date = 2015-11-16| author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063135/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm390574.htm|archive-date = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people who have had a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke.&lt;ref name="AP01"&gt;NPS Prescribing Practice Review 44: Antiplatelets and anticoagulants in stroke prevention (2009).

====Endovascular treatment====
Mechanical removal of the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke, called [[Thrombectomy|mechanical thrombectomy]], is a potential treatment for occlusion of a large artery, such as the [[middle cerebral artery]]. In 2015, one review demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this procedure if performed within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sardar P, Chatterjee S, Giri J, Kundu A, Tandar A, Sen P, Nairooz R, Huston J, Ryan JJ, Bashir R, Parikh SA, White CJ, Meyers PM, Mukherjee D, Majersik JJ, Gray WA | display-authors = 6 | title = Endovascular therapy for acute ischaemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 35 | pages = 2373–80 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26071599 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehv270 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saver JL, Goyal M, van der Lugt A, Menon BK, Majoie CB, Dippel DW, Campbell BC, Nogueira RG, Demchuk AM, Tomasello A, Cardona P, Devlin TG, Frei DF, du Mesnil de Rochemont R, Berkhemer OA, Jovin TG, Siddiqui AH, van Zwam WH, Davis SM, Castaño C, Sapkota BL, Fransen PS, Molina C, van Oostenbrugge RJ, Chamorro Á, Lingsma H, Silver FL, Donnan GA, Shuaib A, Brown S, Stouch B, Mitchell PJ, Davalos A, Roos YB, Hill MD | display-authors = 6 | title = Time to Treatment With Endovascular Thrombectomy and Outcomes From Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 316 | issue = 12 | pages = 1279–88 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27673305 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.13647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not change the risk of death, but reduced disability compared to the use of intravenous thrombolysis which is generally used in people evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goyal M, Menon BK, van Zwam WH, Dippel DW, Mitchell PJ, Demchuk AM, Dávalos A, Majoie CB, van der Lugt A, de Miquel MA, Donnan GA, Roos YB, Bonafe A, Jahan R, Diener HC, van den Berg LA, Levy EI, Berkhemer OA, Pereira VM, Rempel J, Millán M, Davis SM, Roy D, Thornton J, Román LS, Ribó M, Beumer D, Stouch B, Brown S, Campbell BC, van Oostenbrugge RJ, Saver JL, Hill MD, Jovin TG | display-authors = 6 | title = Endovascular thrombectomy after large-vessel ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from five randomised trials | journal = The Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10029 | pages = 1723–31 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26898852 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(16)00163-x | s2cid = 34799180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mistry EA, Mistry AM, Nakawah MO, Chitale RV, James RF, Volpi JJ, Fusco MR | title = Mechanical Thrombectomy Outcomes With and Without Intravenous Thrombolysis in Stroke Patients: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Stroke | volume = 48 | issue = 9 | pages = 2450–2456 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28747462 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.017320 | s2cid = 3751956 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain cases may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powers WJ, Rabinstein AA, Ackerson T, Adeoye OM, Bambakidis NC, Becker K, Biller J, Brown M, Demaerschalk BM, Hoh B, Jauch EC, Kidwell CS, Leslie-Mazwi TM, Ovbiagele B, Scott PA, Sheth KN, Southerland AM, Summers DV, Tirschwell DL | display-authors = 6 | title = 2018 Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association | journal = Stroke | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = e46–e110 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29367334 | doi = 10.1161/STR.0000000000000158 | s2cid = 4972922 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Craniectomy ====
Strokes affecting large portions of the brain can cause significant brain swelling with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in strokes affecting brain tissue dependent upon the middle cerebral artery for blood supply and is also called "malignant cerebral infarction" because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require [[hemicraniectomy]], the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some people &amp;ndash; who would otherwise have died &amp;ndash; survive with disability.&lt;ref name="pmid21190097"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simard JM, Sahuquillo J, Sheth KN, Kahle KT, Walcott BP | title = Managing malignant cerebral infarction | journal = Current Treatment Options in Neurology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–29 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21190097 | pmc = 3243953 | doi = 10.1007/s11940-010-0110-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemorrhagic stroke===
People with [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] require supportive care, including blood pressure control if required. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A proportion may benefit from [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vespa PM, Martin N, Zuccarello M, Awad I, Hanley DF | title = Surgical trials in intracerebral hemorrhage | journal = Stroke | volume = 44 | issue = 6 Suppl 1 | pages = S79-82 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23709739 | pmc = 6778724 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.001494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], early treatment for underlying cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of further hemorrhages. Depending on the site of the aneurysm this may be by [[craniotomy|surgery that involves opening the skull]] or [[Interventional neuroradiology|endovascularly]] (through the blood vessels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steiner T, Juvela S, Unterberg A, Jung C, Forsting M, Rinkel G | title = European Stroke Organization guidelines for the management of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid haemorrhage | journal = Cerebrovascular Diseases | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–112 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23406828 | doi = 10.1159/000346087 | s2cid = 3526670 | url = https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/10138/197740/1/aneurysm_treatment_recommendations_ESO.pdf | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stroke unit===
Ideally, people who have had a stroke are admitted to a "stroke unit", a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to a stroke unit have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke.&lt;ref name=Donnan2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Langhorne|first1=Peter|last2=Ramachandra|first2=Samantha|last3=Stroke Unit Trialists' Collaboration|date=23 April 2020|title=Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care for stroke: network meta-analysis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD000197|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000197.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=7197653|pmid=32324916}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nursing care]] is fundamental in maintaining [[Skin|skin care]], feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring [[vital signs]] such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=David J.|date=May 2014|title=Nursing practice in stroke rehabilitation: systematic review and meta-ethnography|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=23|issue=9–10|pages=1201–1226|doi=10.1111/jocn.12334|issn=1365-2702|pmid=24102924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
[[Stroke rehabilitation]] is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications, and educate family members to play a supporting role. Stroke rehabilitation should begin almost immediately with a multidisciplinary approach. The rehabilitation team may involve physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, [[neurologist]]s, [[clinical pharmacist]]s, nursing staff, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Speech-language pathology|speech-language pathologist]]s, and [[orthotist]]s. Some teams may also include [[psychologists]] and [[social work]]ers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests [[post stroke depression]]. Validated instruments such as the [[Barthel scale]] may be used to assess the likelihood of a person who has had a stroke being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Laura|last2=Gajree|first2=Shelley|last3=Langhorne|first3=Peter|last4=Stott|first4=David J.|last5=Quinn|first5=Terence J.|date=February 2013|title=Reliability (inter-rater agreement) of the Barthel Index for assessment of stroke survivors: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Stroke|volume=44|issue=2|pages=462–468|doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.112.678615|issn=1524-4628|pmid=23299497|s2cid=9499113|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Stroke rehabilitation]] should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the "window" considered officially by [[U.S. state]] rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement.{{Medical citation needed|date=August 2020}} However, some people have reported that they continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking.{{Medical citation needed|date=August 2020}} Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the daily routine for people who have had a stroke. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most people will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.

==== Physical and occupational therapy ====
Physical and occupational therapy have overlapping areas of expertise; however, physical therapy focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with people who have had a stroke to improve awareness and use of the [[hemiplegic]] side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and people's goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote [[motor learning]] involves [[constraint-induced movement therapy]]. Through continuous practice the person relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Sullivan|2007|pp=471, 484, 737, 740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical therapy is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke.&lt;ref name="CD001920"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollock A, Baer G, Campbell P, Choo PL, Forster A, Morris J, Pomeroy VM, Langhorne P | display-authors = 6 | title = Physical rehabilitation approaches for the recovery of function and mobility following stroke | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD001920 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24756870 | pmc = 6465059 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001920.pub3 | editor-last = Cochrane Stroke Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational therapy is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, [[Alexia (condition)|reading]] and [[agraphia|writing]], and toileting. Approaches to helping people with urinary incontinence include physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals, however, it is not clear how effective these approaches are at improving urinary incontinence following a stroke.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Lois H.|last2=Coupe|first2=Jacqueline|last3=Cross|first3=Lucy D.|last4=Tan|first4=Aidan L.|last5=Watkins|first5=Caroline L.|date=February 2019|title=Interventions for treating urinary incontinence after stroke in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2019|issue=2|pages=CD004462|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004462.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6355973|pmid=30706461}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various different positions.&lt;ref name="OSul07_719" /&gt; Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb.&lt;ref name="OSul07_719" /&gt; After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint.&lt;ref name="OSul07_719" /&gt; Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates.&lt;ref name="OSul07_719" /&gt; [[Sensory stimulation therapy#Coactivation|Electrical stimulation]] to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.&lt;ref name="OSul07_719" /&gt; Physical therapy is sometimes suggested for people who experience sexual dysfunction following a stroke.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Hezekiah|last2=Sansom|first2=Joshua|last3=Brown-Major|first3=Anita|last4=Anderson|first4=Paul|last5=Ng|first5=Louisa|date=2020-05-01|title=Interventions for sexual dysfunction following stroke|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2020|issue=5|pages=CD011189|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011189.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=7197697|pmid=32356377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be benefit in high intensity and high doses over a longer period, but these higher intensity doses may not be acceptable to everyone.&lt;ref name="CD001920" /&gt; 

People who have had a stroke may have particular problems, such as [[dysphagia]], which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause [[aspiration pneumonia]]. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]] (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely. Swallowing therapy has mixed results as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bath|first1=Philip M.|last2=Lee|first2=Han Sean|last3=Everton|first3=Lisa F.|date=30 October 2018|title=Swallowing therapy for dysphagia in acute and subacute stroke|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD000323|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000323.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6516809|pmid=30376602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Orthotics#Ankle–foot orthosis (AFO)|Devices]] ====

The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further.

The ability to walk independently in their community, indoors or outdoors, is important following stroke. Although no negative effects have been reported, it is unclear if outcomes can improve with these walking programs when compared to usual treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Barclay RE, Stevenson TJ, Poluha W, Ripat J, Nett C, Srikesavan CS|date=March 2015|title=Interventions for improving community ambulation in individuals with stroke|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=Art.

Some current and future therapy methods include the use of [[virtual reality]] and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating people to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not.&lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Lange B, Flynn S, Rizzo A |title=Initial usability assessment of off-the-shelf video game consoles for clinical game-based motor rehabilitation|journal=Physical Therapy Reviews|year=2009|volume=14|issue=5|pages=355–62|doi=10.1179/108331909X12488667117258 |s2cid=14767181|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/08f64086b0bb04f9e2f40c80eb245287fdb77d8b}}&lt;/ref&gt; While virtual reality and interactive video gaming are not more effective than conventional therapy for improving upper limb function, when used in conjunction with usual care these approaches may improve upper limb function and ADL function.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are inadequate data on the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation and quality of life.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laver KE, Lange B, George S, Deutsch JE, Saposnik G, Crotty M | title = Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD008349 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29156493 | pmc = 6485957 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008349.pub4 | editor-last = Cochrane Stroke Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these off-the-shelf devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.&lt;ref name="Lange" /&gt;

=== Orthotics ===
[[File:Gehen mit Orthese nach Schlaganfall 220.jpg|thumb|Walking with an [[Orthotics#Definition of the orthotic functions in the case of paralysis after a stroke|orthosis after a stroke]]]]
Clinical studies confirm the importance of [[Orthotics|orthoses]] in stroke rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=Falso|date=2017|title=How does a Personalized Rehabilitative Model influence the Functional Response of Different Ankle Foot Orthoses in a Cohort of Patients Affected by Neurological Gait Pattern?|journal=Journal of Novel Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation|volume=1|issue=2|pages=072–092|doi=10.29328/journal.jnpr.1001010|issn=2573-6264|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bowers R|date=2004|title=Report of a Consensus Conference on the Orthotic Management of Stroke Patients, Non-Articulated Ankle-Foot Ortheses|url=https://pure.strath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/35599006/Consensus_Conference_On_The_Orthotic_Management_Of_Stroke_Patients_Netherlands_2003.pdf|journal=International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics|pages=87–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Condie|first1=Elizabeth|url=https://musculoskeletalkey.com/lower-limb-orthoses-for-persons-who-have-had-a-stroke/|title=Lower limb orthoses for persons who have had a stroke|last2=Bowers|first2=Robert James|publisher=John D.

With the help of an orthosis, physiological standing and walking can be learned again, and late health consequences caused by a wrong gait pattern can be prevented. A treatment with an orthosis can therefore be used to support the therapy. 

=== Self-management ===
A stroke can affect the ability to live independently and with quality.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; --&gt; Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; --&gt; These programs are tailored to the target audience, and led by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; --&gt; A 2016 review reported that these programs improve the quality of life after stroke, without negative effects.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; --&gt; People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fryer CE, Luker JA, McDonnell MN, Hillier SL | title = Self management programmes for quality of life in people with stroke | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = Art.

==Prognosis==
Disability affects 75% of stroke survivors enough to decrease their ability to work.&lt;ref name="Coffey2000"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Coffey | first1 = C.

Stroke can affect people physically, mentally, emotionally, or a combination of the three. The results of stroke vary widely depending on size and location of the lesion.&lt;ref name="Stanford2005"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Hospital &amp; Clinics |title=Cardiovascular Diseases: Effects of Stroke |url= http://www.stanfordhospital.com/healthLib/atoz/cardiac/effects.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210050456/http://www.stanfordhospital.com/healthLib/atoz/cardiac/effects.html |archive-date=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Physical effects ===
Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, [[pressure sore]]s, [[pneumonia]], [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[apraxia]] (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out [[activities of daily living|daily activities]], appetite loss, [[aphasia|speech loss]], [[vision loss]] and [[pain]]. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, [[coma]] or death can result. Up to 10% of people following a stroke develop [[seizure]]s, most commonly in the week subsequent to the event; the severity of the stroke increases the likelihood of a seizure.&lt;ref name="Reith1997"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reith J, Jørgensen HS, Nakayama H, Raaschou HO, Olsen TS|date=August 1997|title=Seizures in acute stroke: predictors and prognostic significance.

=== Emotional and mental effects ===
Emotional and mental dysfunctions correspond to areas in the brain that have been damaged. Emotional problems following a stroke can be due to direct damage to emotional centers in the brain or from frustration and difficulty adapting to new limitations. Post-stroke emotional difficulties include [[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s, [[flat affect]] (failure to express emotions), [[mania]], [[apathy]] and [[psychosis]]. Other difficulties may include a decreased ability to communicate emotions through facial expression, body language and voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editors|first1=Tom A. Schweizer, R.

Disruption in self-identity, relationships with others, and emotional well-being can lead to social consequences after stroke due to the lack of ability to communicate. Many people who experience communication impairments after a stroke find it more difficult to cope with the social issues rather than physical impairments. Broader aspects of care must address the emotional impact speech impairment has on those who experience difficulties with speech after a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackenzie|first1=Catherine|title=Dysarthria in stroke: A narrative review of its description and the outcome of intervention|journal=International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|volume=13|issue=2|date=2011|pages=125–36|doi=10.3109/17549507.2011.524940|pmid=21480809|s2cid=39377646|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/28413/1/Mackenzie---IJSLP---penultimate1.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who experience a stroke are at risk of [[paralysis]] which could result in a self disturbed body image which may also lead to other social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ackley|first1=Betty|last2=Ladwig|first2=Gail B.|last3=Kelley|first3=Helen | name-list-style = vanc |title=Nursing diagnosis handbook: an evidence-based guide to planning care|date=2010|publisher=Mosby|location=Maryland Heights, MO.|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

30 to 50% of stroke survivors suffer post-stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, [[Sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]], lowered [[self-esteem]] and withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Senelick1994"&gt;{{cite book | author=Senelick Richard C., Rossi, Peter W., Dougherty, Karla | title=Living with Stroke: A Guide for Families | year=1994 | publisher=Contemporary Books, Chicago | isbn=978-0-8092-2607-8 | oclc=40856888 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/livingwithstroke00sene }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Clinical depression|Depression]] can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with social and family support, [[psychotherapy]] and, in severe cases, [[antidepressant]]s.

[[Emotional lability]], another consequence of stroke, causes the person to switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying with little or no provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the person's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes the affected person to laugh and cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion.&lt;ref name="Coffey2000"/&gt; Some people show the opposite of what they feel, for example crying when they are happy.&lt;ref name="Villarosa1993"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Villarosa | first1 = Linda | last2 = Singleton | first2 = Lafayette | last3 = Johnson | first3 = Kirk A. | name-list-style = vanc | title = The Black health library guide to stroke | publisher = Henry Holt and Co | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8050-2289-6 | oclc = 26929500 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/blackhealthlibra00sing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional lability occurs in about 20% of those who have had a stroke.

 --&gt; The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's [[blood type]]. Having had a stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future strokes.

Men are 25% more likely to suffer strokes than women,&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="NINDS1999"/&gt; yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarosa1993"/&gt; Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="NINDS1999"/&gt; Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, [[menopause]], and the treatment thereof ([[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|HRT]]).

==History==
[[File:Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hippocrates]] first described the sudden paralysis that is often associated with stroke.]]

Episodes of stroke and familial stroke have been reported from the 2nd millennium BC onward in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashrafian H | title = Familial stroke 2700 years ago | journal = Stroke | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = e187; author reply e188 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20185778 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.109.573170 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] (460 to 370 BC) was first to describe the phenomenon of sudden [[paralysis]] that is often associated with [[ischemia]]. [[Apoplexy]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "struck down with violence", first appeared in Hippocratic writings to describe this phenomenon.&lt;!--
The Hippocratic dictum that "It is impossible to cure a severe attack of apoplexy and difficult to cure a mild one"

The word ''stroke'' was used as a synonym for apoplectic [[seizure]] as early as 1599,&lt;ref&gt;R. Barnhart, ed. ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term.  The term ''apoplectic stroke'' is an archaic, nonspecific term, for a cerebrovascular accident accompanied by haemorrhage or haemorrhagic stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apoplectic Stroke |url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/apoplectic+stroke |website=TheFreeDictionary.com |access-date=13 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] was described as having an ''apoplectic stroke'' that deprived him of his speech shortly before his death in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brecht, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. tr. James L. Schaaf, Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985–93, 3:369–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, in his ''Apoplexia'', [[Johann Jakob Wepfer|Johann Jacob Wepfer]] (1620–1695) identified the cause of [[hemorrhagic]] stroke when he suggested that people who had [[died]] of apoplexy had bleeding in their brains.&lt;ref name="NINDS1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stroke1996-Thompson"/&gt;
Wepfer also identified the main [[arteries]] supplying the brain, the [[vertebral]] and [[carotid]] arteries, and identified the cause of a type of [[ischemic]] stroke known as a [[cerebral infarction]] when he suggested that [[apoplexy]] might be caused by a blockage to those vessels.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="NINDS1999"/&gt; [[Rudolf Virchow]] first described the mechanism of [[thromboembolism]] as a major factor.&lt;ref name="pmid4914683"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiller F | title = Concepts of stroke before and after Virchow | journal = Medical History | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–31 | date = April 1970 | pmid = 4914683 | pmc = 1034034 | doi = 10.1017/S0025727300015325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cerebrovascular accident'' was introduced in 1927, reflecting a "growing awareness and acceptance of vascular theories and (...) recognition of the consequences of a sudden disruption in the vascular supply of the brain".&lt;ref name="FingerBoller2010"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Stanley | last1 = Finger | first2 = François | last2 = Boller | first3 = Kenneth L. | last3 = Tyler | name-list-style = vanc |title=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bggTAQAAMAAJ|access-date=1 October 2013|year=2010|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-444-52009-8|page=401|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012220445/http://books.google.com/books?id=bggTAQAAMAAJ|archive-date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use is now discouraged by a number of neurology textbooks, reasoning that the connotation of fortuitousness carried by the word ''accident'' insufficiently highlights the modifiability of the underlying risk factors.&lt;ref name="Scadding2011"&gt;{{cite book| first = John W. | last = Scadding | name-list-style = vanc |title=Clinical Neurology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdkIPE-xpYYC&amp;pg=PA488|access-date=1 October 2013|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-340-99070-4|page=488|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012213853/http://books.google.com/books?id=PdkIPE-xpYYC&amp;pg=PA488|archive-date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SirvenMalamut2008"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Joseph I. | last1 = Sirven | first2 = Barbara L. | last2 = Malamut | name-list-style = vanc |title=Clinical Neurology of the Older Adult|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1tL8C9ryMQC&amp;pg=PA243|access-date=1 October 2013|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6947-1|page=243|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012213727/http://books.google.com/books?id=c1tL8C9ryMQC&amp;pg=PA243|archive-date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaufmanMilstein2012"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = David Myland | last1 = Kaufman | first2 = Mark J | last2 = Milstein | name-list-style = vanc |title=Kaufman's Clinical Neurology for Psychiatrists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fXzaAT_pwkC&amp;pg=PT892|access-date=1 October 2013|date=5 December 2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4557-4004-8|page=892|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012220403/http://books.google.com/books?id=7fXzaAT_pwkC&amp;pg=PT892|archive-date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cerebrovascular insult'' may be used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Mosby&gt;{{cite book|title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
