'''Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter''' ({{IPAc-en|b|iː|ˈ|j|ɒ|n|s|eɪ}} {{respell|bee|YON|say}}; {{nee|'''Knowles'''}}; born September 4, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2009/12/23/beyonce_knowles_name_change/|title=Beyoncé Knowles' name change|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=December 23, 2009|access-date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Born and raised in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of [[Destiny's Child]], one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups of all time]]. Their hiatus saw the release of her first solo album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003), which featured the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles "[[Crazy in Love]]" and "[[Baby Boy (Beyoncé song)|Baby Boy]]".

Following the 2006 disbandment of Destiny's Child, she released her second solo album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'', which contained hit singles "[[Irreplaceable]]" and "[[Beautiful Liar]]". Beyoncé also starred in multiple films such as ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (2006), ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006), ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'' (2019). Her marriage to Jay-Z and her portrayal of [[Etta James]] in ''[[Cadillac Records]]'' (2008) influenced her third album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008), which earned a record-setting [[Grammy Award records#Most Grammys won by a female artist in one night|six Grammy Awards]] in 2010. It spawned the successful singles "[[If I Were a Boy]]", "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]", and "[[Halo (Beyoncé song)|Halo]]".

After splitting from her manager and father [[Mathew Knowles]] in 2010, Beyoncé released her musically diverse fourth album ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' in 2011. She later achieved universal acclaim for her sonically experimental visual albums, ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' (2013) and ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' (2016), the latter of which was the world's best-selling album of 2016 and the most acclaimed album of her career, exploring themes of [[infidelity]] and [[womanism]]. In 2018, she released ''[[Everything Is Love]]'', a collaborative album with her husband, [[Jay-Z]], as [[the Carters]]. As a featured artist, Beyoncé topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 with the remixes of "[[Perfect (Ed Sheeran song)#Perfect Duet|Perfect]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] in 2017 and "[[Savage (song)#Beyoncé remix|Savage]]" by [[Megan Thee Stallion]] in 2020. The same year, she released the [[musical film]] and [[visual album]] ''[[Black Is King]]'' to widespread acclaim.

Beyoncé has long received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer&lt;ref name="Kritselis"/&gt; or for which her contributions were marginal.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; In a cover story for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 2005, she claimed to have "written" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.&lt;ref name="Kritselis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kritselis|first=Alex|date=May 4, 2014|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/the-sunday-independent/20140504/282235188670231|title=Beyonce is great, but... she steals from other artists|newspaper=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|access-date=August 24, 2020|via=PressReader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child hit "Bootylicious",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theboombox.com/beyonce-bootylicious/|title=Beyonce Accused of Stealing Credit for 'Bootylicious'|website=[[The Boombox]]|access-date=August 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provoked the song's producer [[Rob Fusari]] to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. As Fusari tells ''Billboard'', "[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Marks|first=Craig|date=February 24, 2010|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959293/producer-rob-fusari-dishes-on-lady-gaga-beyonce|title=Producer Rob Fusari Dishes on Lady Gaga, Beyoncé|magazine=Billboard|access-date=August 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview for ''Entertainment Weekly'' in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé "had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Inside the making of Destiny's Child's 'Bootylicious' 15 years later|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/05/20/destinys-child-bootylicious-15th-anniversary/|access-date=August 24, 2020|website=EW.com|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] ruled out Beyoncé as a songwriter on "Listen" (from ''Dreamgirls'') for its Oscar nomination in the Best Original Song category. Responding to a then-new three-writer limit, the Academy deemed her contribution the least significant for inclusion.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; In 2009, Ryan Tedder's original demo for "Halo" leaked on the Internet, revealing an identical resemblance to Beyoncé's recording, for which she received a writing credit. When interviewed by ''The Guardian'', Tedder explained that Beyoncé had edited the bridge of the song vocally and thus earned the credit, although he vaguely questioned the ethics of her possible "demand" for a writing credit in other instances.&lt;ref name="Kritselis"/&gt; Tedder elaborated when speaking to Gigwise that “She does stuff on any given song that, when you go from the demo to the final version, takes it to another level that you never would have thought of as the writer. For instance, on ‘Halo,’ that bridge on her version is completely different to my original one. Basically, she came in, ditched that, edited it, did her vocal thing on it, and now it's become one of my favorite parts of the song. The whole melody, she wrote it spontaneously in the studio. So her credit on that song stems from that.” &lt;ref name="WMag"&gt;{{cite web|date=June 19, 2018|url=https://wmagazine.com/story/beyonce-writes-her-own-songs/|title=Beyoncé Is "100 Percent Involved" in Writing Her Own Songs Say Everything Is Love Producers Cool &amp; Dre|website=[[W Magazine]]|access-date=August 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the popular industry songwriter [[Linda Perry]] responded to a question about Beyoncé receiving a co-writing credit for changing one lyric to a song: "Well haha um that's not songwriting but some of these artists believe if it wasn't for them your song would never get out there so they take a cut just because they are who they are. But everyone knows the real truth about Beyoncé. She is talented but in a completely different way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Lindsey|date=July 16, 2014|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/linda-perry-comments-on-beyonces-songwriting.html|title=Linda Perry Is Not Impressed with Beyoncé's 'Songwriting'|website=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|access-date=August 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's remarks were echoed by [[Frank Ocean]], who acknowledged the trend of recording artists forcing writing credits while jokingly suggesting Beyoncé had an exceptional status.&lt;ref name="Kritselis"/&gt;

Reflecting on the controversy, ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' columnist Alexis Kritselis wrote in 2014, "It seems as though our love for all things Beyoncé has blinded us to the very real claims of theft and plagiarism that have plagued her career for years", and that, "because of her power and influence in the music industry, it may be hard for some songwriters to 'just say no' to Beyoncé."&lt;ref name="Kritselis"/&gt; While reporting on her controversial writing record, pop culture critics such as [[Roger Friedman]] and ''[[The Daily Beast]]''{{'}}s Kevin Fallon said the trend has redefined popular conceptions of songwriting, with Fallon saying, "the village of authors and composers that populate ''Lemonade'', [Kanye West']s ''[[Life of Pablo]]'', [Rihanna's] ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]'', or [Drake's] ''[[Views (album)|Views]]''&amp;nbsp;– all of which are still reflective of an artist's voice and vision ... speaks to the truth of the way the industry's top artists create their music today: by committee."&lt;ref name="Fallon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=April 13, 2017|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/does-beyonce-write-her-own-music-and-does-it-really-matter|title=Does Beyoncé Write Her Own Music?

Murphy of ''Vanity Fair'' suggests Beyoncé is among the major artists like [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Billie Holiday]] who are "celebrated [not] because [they] write such good parts, but because [they] create them out of the words that are given".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Murphy|first=James S.|date=April 25, 2016|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/04/beyonce-songwriters|title=Here's Why Criticizing Beyoncé for Working with Songwriters Is Ignorant|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|access-date=August 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, ''Everything Is Love'' producers [[Cool &amp; Dre]] stated that Beyoncé is "100 percent involved" in writing her own songs, with Dre saying that "She put her mind to the music and did her thing. If she had a melody idea, she came up with the words. If we had the words, she came up with the melody. She’s a beast," when speaking on the writing process of ''Everything Is Love''.&lt;ref name="WMag"/&gt; [[Ne-Yo]], when asked about his collaborative writing experience with Beyoncé on "Irreplaceable," said that they both wrote “two damn totally different songs [...] So, yeah, I gave her writer’s credit. Because that counts. That’s writing.... She put her spin on it.”&lt;ref name="WMag"/&gt; As for Drake: “‘Pound Cake’ happened while I was writing for Beyoncé or working with Beyoncé, not writing for, working with. I hate saying writing for ’cause she’s a phenomenal writer. She has bars on bars.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2013/09/26/drake-says-beyonce-has-bars-reveals-plans-for-singing-album/|title=Drake Says Beyoncé Has 'Bars,' Reveals Plans for Singing Album|website=Rap-Up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The-Dream]] revealed: "We did a whole Fela album that didn’t go up. It was right before we did 4. We did a whole different sounding thing, about twenty songs. She said she wanted to do something that sounds like Fela. That’s why there’s so much of that sound in the “End of Time.” There's always multiple albums being made. Most of the time we’re just being creative, period.

[[File:Beyonce MTV EMA 2009.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Beyoncé performing during the [[2009 MTV Europe Music Awards]]]]

In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on ''B'Day'') which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For The Record: Quick News On Beyoncé, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Taylor Hicks, JC Chasez, Beth Orton, Slayer &amp; More|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533901/beyonce-seeks-allgirl-band.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=June 8, 2006|access-date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for "Irreplaceable" and "Green Light".&lt;ref name="Vineyard1" /&gt; The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... World Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016).

Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]'' placed her at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wieselman|first=Jarett|title=The Five Best Singer/Dancers|url=http://pagesix.com/2011/03/04/the-five-best-singerdancers/|work=[[New York Post]]|date=March 4, 2011|access-date=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barbara Ellen of ''The Guardian'' Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellen|first=Barbara|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/24/beyonce|title=She's a woman of two-halves|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528123108/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/may/24/beyonce|archive-date=May 28, 2009|location=London|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Alice Jones of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote she "takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Alice|title=Beyoncé, 02 Arena, London: Diva who answers the call of booty|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/beyonc-02-arena-london-1691069.html|work=The Independent|date=May 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528232659/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/beyonc-02-arena-london-1691069.html|archive-date=May 28, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ex-President of [[Def Jam]] [[L.A.

Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including [[Melina Matsoukas]], [[Jonas Åkerlund]], and [[Jake Nava]]. [[Bill Condon]], director of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', stated that the ''Lemonade'' visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, "You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie ''Lemonade'', this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/beauty-and-the-beast-la-la-land-musical/|title=How La La Land Helped Live-Action Beauty and the Beast Remake|date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alter ego===
Described as being "sexy, seductive and provocative" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the [[alter ego]] "Sasha Fierce" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha as being "too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy", stating, "I'm not like her in real life at all."&lt;ref name="Depression" /&gt; Sasha was conceived during the making of "Crazy in Love", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, ''I Am... Sasha Fierce''. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]'' magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crosley|first=Hillary|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632774/beyonce-killed-sasha-fierce.jhtml|title=Beyoncé Says She 'Killed' Sasha Fierce|publisher=MTV News|date=February 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604063547/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632774/beyonce-killed-sasha-fierce.jhtml|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her ''Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live'' shows later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/05/25/beyonce-prepares-for-revel-concerts-part-2/|title=Beyoncé Prepares for Revel Concerts (Part 2)|magazine=Rap-Up|date=May 25, 2012|access-date=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beyhive is the name given to Beyoncé's fan base. Fans were previously titled "The Beyontourage", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage). The name Bey Hive derives from the word [[beehive]], purposely misspelled to resemble her first name, and was penned by fans after petitions on the online [[social networking service]] [[Twitter]] and online news reports during competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonceonline.com/us/news/video-premiere-i-was-here-live-roseland|title=Video Premiere: 'I Was Here (Live At Roseland)'|publisher=Beyonceonline.com|date=November 16, 2011|access-date=June 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503015331/http://www.beyonceonline.com/us/news/video-premiere-i-was-here-live-roseland|archive-date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine said that Beyoncé's look was "far from the glamorous [[Sasha Fierce]]" and that it was "a return to her African roots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-criticized-for-blackface-photo-shoot-20110224|title=Beyoncé Criticized for 'Blackface' Photo Shoot|website=Rolling Stone|date=February 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227070817/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-criticized-for-blackface-photo-shoot-20110224|archive-date=February 27, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the [[music streaming]] service [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]. The service specializes in [[Lossless compression|lossless]] audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband [[Jay-Z]] acquired the parent company of Tidal, [[Aspiro]], in the first quarter of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/business/media/jay-z-buys-the-music-streaming-firm-aspiro.html|title=Jay-Z Buys the Music Streaming Firm, Aspiro|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2015|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as [[Kanye West]], [[Rihanna]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6509498/jay-z-tidal-launch-artist-stakeholders|title=It's Official: Jay-Z's Historic Tidal Launches With 16 Artist Stakeholders|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Andrew|last=Flanagan|date=March 30, 2015|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/business/media/jay-z-reveals-plans-for-tidal-a-streaming-music-service.html|title=Jay-Z Reveals Plans for Tidal, a Streaming Music Service|work=The New York Times|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=March 30, 2015|access-date=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company [[Peloton (exercise equipment company)|Peloton]]. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in [[historically black colleges and universities]], providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé's 2019 [[Homecoming (2019 film)|''Homecoming'' film]] and [[Homecoming: The Live Album|live album]] after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: "When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9481127/beyonce-peloton-partnership-hbcu-homecoming|title=Beyoncé Teams With Peloton for Multi-Year Partnership Benefiting Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peloton Rises on Partnership With Beyonce for Workout Series |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/peloton-surges-after-fitness-partnership-with-beyonce |website=Bloomberg.com |language=en |date=November 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
