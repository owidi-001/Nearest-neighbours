He was elected to the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/28885901/tiger-woods-inducted-world-golf-hall-fame-2021 |title=Tiger Woods to be inducted into World Golf Hall of Fame in 2021 |publisher=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=March 11, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in 1996 at the age of 20. By the end of April 1997, he won three [[PGA Tour]] events in addition to his first major, the [[1997 Masters Tournament|1997 Masters]], which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance. He reached [[List of World Number One male golfers|number one]] in the [[Official World Golf Ranking|world rankings]] for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 consecutive weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 consecutive weeks). During this time, he won 13 of golf's major championships.

The next decade of Woods' career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries. He took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 in an attempt to resolve marital issues with his wife [[Elin Nordegren|Elin]] at the time. Woods admitted to multiple infidelities, and the couple eventually divorced.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; He fell to number 58 in the world rankings in November 2011 before ascending again to the number-one ranking between March 2013 and May 2014.&lt;ref name=Westwood&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/9143219.stm |work=BBC News |title=Westwood becomes world number one |date=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chevron/&gt; However, injuries led him to undergo four [[Discectomy|back surgeries]] between 2014 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pga.com/news/pga-tour/complete-list-tiger-woods-injuries|title=Complete list of Tiger Woods' injuries|publisher=PGA Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods competed in only one tournament between August 2015 and January 2018, and he dropped off the list of the world's top 1,000 golfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2018/08/01/tiger-woods-favorite-firestone-wgc-bridgestone/880461002/| title=With game on point, Tiger Woods is in perfect place to win again at Firestone| date= August 1, 2018| newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reid |first=Philip |title=For the new Tiger Woods, second place is far from first loser |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/golf/for-the-new-tiger-woods-second-place-is-far-from-first-loser-1.3595018 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |location=Dublin |date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return to regular competition, Woods made steady progress to the top of the game, winning his first tournament in five years at the [[Tour Championship]] in September 2018 and his first major in 11 years at the [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019 Masters]].

Woods has held numerous golf records. He has been the number one player in the world for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer in history. He has been awarded [[PGA Player of the Year]] a record 11 times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/b/2009/10/20/woods-wins-pga-player-of-the-year-award.htm|title=Woods Clinches PGA Player of the Year Award|last1= Kelley|first1=Brent|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=About.com: Golf|access-date=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has won the [[Vardon Trophy|Byron Nelson Award]] for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times. Woods has the record of leading the [[PGA Tour#Money winners and most wins leaders|money list]] in ten different seasons. He has won 15 professional [[Men's major golf championships|major golf championships]] (trailing only [[Jack Nicklaus]], who leads with 18) and 82 [[PGA Tour]] events (tied for first all time with [[Sam Snead]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Tiger|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/3295562/|access-date=June 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603083350/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/3295562/|archive-date=June 3, 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins.
Woods is the fifth (after [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Ben Hogan]], [[Gary Player]] and Jack Nicklaus) player to achieve the career [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]], and the youngest to do so. He is also the second golfer (after Nicklaus) to achieve a career Grand Slam three times. 

Woods has won 18 [[World Golf Championships]]. He was also part of the American winning team for the [[1999 Ryder Cup]]. In May 2019, Woods was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Donald Trump, the fourth golfer to receive the honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-tiger-woods-medal-of-freedom.html |title='I've Battled,' Tiger Woods Says as He Accepts Presidential Medal of Freedom |date=May 6, 2019 |last=Rogers |first=Katie |access-date=May 8, 2019 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2021, Woods was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after a single-car collision and underwent emergency surgery to repair compound fractures sustained in each leg in addition to a shattered ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/tiger-woods-car-crash-california/index.html |title=Tiger Woods injured in car crash |date=February 23, 2021 |access-date=February 23, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods' first name, Eldrick, was chosen by his mother because it began with "E" (for Earl) and ended with "K" (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend, South Vietnamese Colonel Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tiger's dad gave us all some lessons to remember |work=Golf Digest |last=Callahan |first=Tom |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2431953 |date=May 9, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and amateur golf career==
Woods grew up in [[Orange County, California]]. He was a child prodigy who was introduced to golf before the age of two by his athletic father Earl Woods. Earl was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer who also was one of the earliest African-American college [[baseball]] players at [[Kansas State University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Training a Tiger: Raising a Winner in Golf and in Life'', by [[Earl Woods]] and Pete McDaniel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a member of the military and had playing privileges at the Navy golf course beside the [[Joint Forces Training Base - Los Alamitos|Joint Forces Training Base]] in [[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]], which allowed Tiger to play there. Tiger also played at the par 3 Heartwell golf course in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], as well as some of the [[Golf course#Municipal|municipals]] in Long Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golf.com/courses-and-travel/play-golf-where-tiger-became-tiger |title=Play Golf Where Tiger Became Tiger |website=Golf Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Woods putted against comedian [[Bob Hope]] in a television appearance on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course.

Woods' father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years, with Earl trying his best. He lost to Woods every time from then on.&lt;ref&gt;

When Woods was 13 years old, he played in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major national junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro [[John Daly (golfer)|John Daly]], who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat him by only one stroke.&lt;ref&gt;''Training A Tiger: A Father's Guide to Raising a Winner in Both Golf and Life'', by [[Earl Woods]] with Pete McDaniel, 1997, Harper Collins, New York, {{ISBN|0-06-270178-9}}, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young teenager, Woods first met [[Jack Nicklaus]] in Los Angeles at the [[Bel-Air Country Club]], when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack Nicklaus: Memories and Mementos from Golf's Golden Bear'', by Jack Nicklaus with David Shedloski, 2007, Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, New York, {{ISBN|1-58479-564-6}}, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.&lt;ref name="callahan1"/&gt;

Woods was 15 years old and a student at [[Western High School (Anaheim, California)|Western High School]] in Anaheim when he became the youngest [[U.S. Junior Amateur]] champion; this was a record that stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010.&lt;ref name="USJA91"&gt;{{cite web|title = 1991 U.S. Junior Amateur|publisher=U.S. Junior Amateur|url = http://www.usjunioram.org/2002/history/champions/1991.html|access-date =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named 1991's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the tournament's first two-time winner. He also competed in his first PGA Tour event, the [[Nissan Los Angeles Open]] (he missed the 36-hole cut), and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.&lt;ref name="USJA92"&gt;{{cite web|title = 1992 U.S. Junior Amateur|publisher=U.S. Junior Amateur|url = http://www.usjunioram.org/2002/history/champions/1992.html|access-date =May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMG"&gt;{{cite web|title = Tiger Woods|publisher=IMG Speakers|url = http://www.imgspeakers.com/speakers/tiger_woods.aspx|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070429145830/http://www.imgspeakers.com/speakers/tiger_woods.aspx|archive-date = April 29, 2007|access-date =June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods graduated from Western High School at age 18 in 1994 and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" among the graduating class. He starred for the high school's golf team under coach Don Crosby.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wicked Game: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and the Story of Modern Golf'', by Howard Sounes, 2004, William Morrow, New York, {{ISBN|0-06-051386-1}}, information listed on inset photos between pages 168 and 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods learned to manage his [[stuttering]] as a boy.&lt;ref&gt;

==College golf career==
Woods was heavily recruited by college golf powers. He chose [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford University]], the 1994 [[NCAA]] champions. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship and won his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational, that September.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanford Men's Golf Team Tiger Woods |publisher=Stanford Men's Golf Team |date=April 8, 2003 |url=http://www.stanfordmensgolf.com/stanford_greats/tigerwoods.htm |access-date=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected a major in economics and was nicknamed "[[Steve Urkel|Urkel]]" by college teammate [[Notah Begay III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosaforte |first=Tim |title=Tiger Woods: The Makings of a Champion |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1997 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312964375/page/84 84, 101] |isbn=0-312-96437-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312964375/page/84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the [[Newport Country Club]] in [[Rhode Island]]&lt;ref name="Sounes, p. 277"/&gt; and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports).&lt;ref name="PAC10"&gt;{{cite web|title = PAC-10 Men's Golf|publisher=PAC-10 Conference|url = http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/pac10/sports/c-golf/auto_pdf/m-golf-records.pdf|access-date =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ages"&gt;{{cite web| title = Tiger Woods through the Ages...|publisher=Geocities|url = http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/2396/tigerwatch.html| access-date =May 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730221824/http://geocities.com/Colosseum/2396/tigerwatch.html|archive-date=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 19, Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major, the [[1995 Masters Tournament|1995 Masters]], and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut; two years later, he won the tournament by 12 strokes. At age 20 in 1996, he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA individual golf championship]].&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiger Woods Captures 1996 NCAA Individual Title |publisher=Stanford University |url=http://gostanford.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/archive/stan-m-golf-96woodsncaa.html |access-date=May 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029151406/http://gostanford.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/archive/stan-m-golf-96woodsncaa.html |archive-date=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In winning the silver medal as leading amateur at [[The Open Championship]], he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281.&lt;ref name="Open1996"&gt;Rosaforte 1997, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; He left college after two years in order to turn professional in the golf industry.

In 2000, Woods won six consecutive events on the PGA Tour, which was the longest winning streak since [[Ben Hogan]] did it in 1948. One of these was the [[2000 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what ''Sports Illustrated'' called "the greatest performance in golf history", in which Woods won the tournament by a record 15-stroke margin and earned a check for $800,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Open and Shut |first=John |last=Garrity |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/golf/specials/tiger/2005/06/09/tiger.2000usopen/index.html |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=June 26, 2000 |access-date=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]].&lt;ref name="10Years3"&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Years of Tiger Woods Part 3 |work=Golf Digest |first=Ron |last=Sirak |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/features/tigerwoods/index?part=3 |access-date=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history.

When Woods won the [[2001 Masters Tournament|2001 Masters]], he became the only player to win four consecutive major professional golf titles, although not in the same calendar year.

Woods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the [[2009 Presidents Cup]], but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he did not do so.&lt;ref&gt;

In August, Woods hired [[Sean Foley (golf instructor)|Sean Foley]] as Haney's replacement. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.

In 2011, Woods' performance continued to suffer; this took its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the [[2011 Masters Tournament|2011 Masters]], where he tied for fourth place.&lt;ref&gt;

Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the [[Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship]] and the [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]]) where he started off well but struggled on the final rounds. Following the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]], where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7608618/nick-watney-ousts-tiger-woods-match-play-championship-second-round |title=Nick Watney eliminates Tiger Woods |first=Farrell |last=Evans |date=February 24, 2012 |publisher=ESPN |access-date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the [[Honda Classic]], with the lowest final-round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], his first win on the PGA Tour since the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]] in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the [[Memorial Tournament]] in June, tying [[Jack Nicklaus]] in second place for most PGA Tour victories;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklytimesofindia.com/sports-news/tiger-wins-memorial-to-match-nicklaus-on-73-wins/ |title=Tiger wins Memorial to match Nicklaus on 73 wins |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=June 4, 2012 |access-date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the [[AT&amp;T National]], to trail only [[Sam Snead]], who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/18668946 |title=Tiger Woods wins AT&amp;T to pass Jack Nicklaus record |work=BBC Sport |date=July 2, 2012 |access-date=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2013 brought a return of Woods' dominating play. In January, he won the [[Farmers Insurance Open]] by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he won the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8890930/tiger-takes-torrey-record-7th-time-farmers-insurance-open-golf |title=Tiger takes Torrey for 75th tour win |date=January 29, 2013 |first=Farrell |last=Evans |publisher=ESPN |access-date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he won the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]], also for the seventh time, giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9037944/tiger-woods-wins-wgc-cadillac-championship-76th-pga-tour-victory |title=Tiger Woods prevails at Doral |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=March 10, 2013 |access-date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, he won the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], winning the event for a record-tying 8th time.

During the [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013 Masters]], Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a post-round interview with [[ESPN]] that he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his third shot bounced off the pin and into the water. After further [[Trial by television in golf tournaments|review of television footage]], Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Tiger Woods facing disqualification at Masters? |url=http://www.cbssports.com/golf/blog/eye-on-golf/22059739/is-tiger-woods-facing-disqualification-at-masters |work=CBS Sports |access-date=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won [[The Players Championship]] in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he got to four wins in any season of his professional career.

[[File:Tiger Woods 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Woods practicing in a bunker prior to the start of the 2014 [[Quicken Loans National]]]]
Woods had a poor showing at the [[2013 U.S. Open (golf)|2013 U.S. Open]] as a result of an elbow injury that he sustained at [[The Players Championship]]. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner [[Justin Rose]]. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the [[Greenbrier Classic]] and his own [[AT&amp;T National]], he returned at the [[2013 Open Championship|Open Championship]] at [[Muirfield]]. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind [[Lee Westwood]], he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner [[Phil Mickelson]]. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the [[2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational|WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]], recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second-round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven-stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. But at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club, Woods never was in contention, making 2013 his fifth full season where he did not win a major; he was in contention in only two of the four majors in 2013.

After a slow start to 2014, Woods sustained an injury during the final round of the [[Honda Classic]] and was unable to finish the tournament. He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods walks off at Honda Classic |magazine=bunkered |date=March 3, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-walks-off-at-honda-classic |access-date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently competed in the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]] but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] at the end of March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods a doubt for the Masters |magazine=bunkered |date=March 19, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-a-doubt-for-the-masters |access-date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after undergoing [[microdiscectomy|back surgery]], he announced on April 1 that he would miss the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] for the first time since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods out of the Masters |magazine=bunkered |date=April 1, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-out-of-the-masters |access-date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods returned at the [[Quicken Loans National]] in June, however he said that his expectations for the week were low. He struggled with nearly every aspect of his game and missed the cut. He next played at [[The Open Championship]], contested at Hoylake, where Woods won eight years prior. Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and eventually finished 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the [[2014 PGA Championship]] where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. Woods said there was currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2014/08/25/tiger-woods-sean-foley-coach-split/14561331/ |title=Tiger Woods splits with swing coach Sean Foley |newspaper=USA Today |date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the [[Farmers Insurance Open]] after another back injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/tiger-woods-withdraws-farmers-insurance-open |title=Tiger Withdraws From the Farmers Insurance Open With Bad Back |work=Golf Magazine |first=Gary |last=Van Sickle |date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and he would take a break from golf until his back healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/news/2015/02/11/108976880/his-back-feeling-better-tiger-plans-to-work-on-his-game-and-play-again-soon/ |title=His back feeling better, Tiger plans to work on his game and play again soon |date=February 11, 2015 |publisher=tigerwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for the [[2015 Masters Tournament|Masters]], finishing in a tie for 17th.

===Tiger-proofing===
Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf industry analysts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of [[Knight Ridder]] asked in a column, "Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).&lt;ref name="Bad"&gt;{{cite news |title=Woods bad for golf? There's an unplayable lie |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |last=Lyon |first=Bill |date=August 16, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.

A related effect was measured by [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a "superstar" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030936/http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf |date=April 17, 2012 }}, Job Market Paper, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, in a strategy that became known as "Tiger-proofing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harig |first1=Bob |title='Tiger-proofing' Augusta took a toll on all |url=https://www.espn.com/golf/masters11/columns/story?columnist=harig_bob&amp;page=110329-RTTMasters |publisher=ESPN |access-date=April 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.&lt;ref name="Open2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Woods Press Conference:The Open Championship |publisher=TigerWoods.com |agency=ASAP Sports |date=July 12, 2005 |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&amp;iNewsID=199184&amp;categoryID=&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;cat=0 |access-date=May 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316104728/http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&amp;iNewsID=199184&amp;categoryID=&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;cat=0 |archive-date=March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career achievements==

Woods has won 82 official [[PGA Tour]] events, including 15 [[Men's major golf championships|majors]]. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as "the greatest closer in history".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web |title=Tiger is greatest closer ever |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14002254/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521213603/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14002254/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 21, 2007 |first=Mike |last=Celizic |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=July 24, 2006 |access-date=August 12, 2007 }}

Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He is one of five players (along with [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Ben Hogan]], [[Gary Player]], and [[Jack Nicklaus]]) to have won all four major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farrell |first=Andy |title=Woods moves majestically to grand slam |work=The Independent |date=July 24, 2000 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/woods-moves-majestically-to-grand-slam-708668.html |access-date=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods is the only player to have consecutively won all four major championships open to professionals, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.

When Woods first joined the [[PGA Tour]] in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf,&lt;ref&gt;

Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years{{when|date=May 2017}} he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.&lt;ref name="linkageinc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Case Study: Tiger Woods |publisher=Linkage Incorporated |url=http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015151438/http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx |archive-date=October 15, 2006 |access-date=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web |title=When Par isn't good enough |website=APMP.org |url=http://www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx |access-date=May 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081846/http://www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx |archive-date=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiger Woods Up Close And Personal |publisher=[[CBS News]] |first=Ed |last=Bradley |date=September 3, 2006 |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/23/60minutes/main1433767_page5.shtml |access-date=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach [[Butch Harmon]]. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods's full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better [[kinesiology]].

The [[TGR Foundation]] was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl as the Tiger Woods Foundation with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children.&lt;ref&gt;

===Tiger Woods Design===
In November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, [[Tiger Woods Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Soltau |first=Mark |title=Tiger Woods' next step: Design golf courses |publisher=ESPN |date=November 6, 2006 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2651591 |access-date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in [[Dubai]] as part of a 25.3-million-square-foot development, [[The Tiger Woods Dubai]].&lt;ref name=dubai&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolfensberger |first=Marc |title=Tiger Woods Will Design First Golf Course in Dubai |publisher=Bloomberg |date=December 3, 2006 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aNvm0ZjXUZ3M |access-date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009.&lt;ref name=dubai/&gt; As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, ''The New York Times'' reported that the project had been shelved permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fattah |first=Zainab |title=Tiger Woods's Dubai Golf Resort Will Be Completed, Builder Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=February 1, 2010 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3KSfSvghqjA |access-date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sullivan&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Paul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/business/03tiger.html|title=For Tiger Woods, a Golf Course Design Business Is in the Rough |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 2, 2011 |access-date=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-holding-dissolves-tiger-woods-partnership-508322.html |date=July 9, 2013 |first=Shane |last=McGinley |title=Dubai Holding 'dissolves' Tiger Woods partnership |website=arabianbusiness.com |publisher=[[ITP Publishing Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiger to design his first U.S. course |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2974491 |access-date =August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt; A third course, in [[Punta Brava Golf Club|Punta Brava]], [[Mexico]], was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an [[environmental impact study]].&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Louis |first1=Brian |last2=Taub |first2=Daniel |title=Tiger Woods and Flagship to Build Mexico Golf Resort |publisher=Bloomberg |date=October 7, 2008 |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ao2vcPf3MUek&amp;refer=us |access-date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;

These projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors that include overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout the global economy (particularly the [[United States housing bubble|U.S. crash in home prices]]), and the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;

===Writings===
Woods wrote a golf instruction column for ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine from 1997 to February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New deal includes instruction, Web pieces |agency=Associated Press |date=May 8, 2002 |publisher=ESPN |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/story?id=1380039 |access-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, ''How I Play Golf'', which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2001-10-09-tiger-woods.htm |title=Tiger Woods joins the club of golf book authors |access-date=June 20, 2008 |last=Snider |first=Mike |date=October 9, 2001 |newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, he published a memoir, ''The 1997 Masters: My Story'', co-authored by [[Lorne Rubenstein]], which focuses on his first Masters win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Stachura |first=Mike |title=Tiger Woods' new book is a vivid but cautious reflection on his landmark win |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/tiger-woods-new-book-is-a-vivid-but-cautious-reflection-on-his-landmark-win |magazine=Golf Digest |date=March 14, 2017 |access-date=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2019, Woods announced he would be writing a memoir book titled ''Back''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://golf.com/news/tiger-woods-book-memoir-titled-back/ |title='This book is my definitive story': Tiger Woods working on release of memoir 'Back' |website=Golf Magazine |date=October 15, 2019 |last=Berhow |first=Josh |access-date=January 6, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships and children ===
In November 2003, Woods became engaged to [[Elin Nordegren]], a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration [[Barbro Holmberg]] and radio journalist [[Thomas Nordegren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 4, 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/12/03/elin.five.things.to.know/index.html?iref=mpstoryview

Woods and Nordegren's first child was a daughter born in 2007, whom they named Sam Alexis Woods.

=== Infidelity scandal and fallout ===

In November 2009, the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' published a story claiming that Woods had an [[extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] with New York City nightclub manager [[Rachel Uchitel]], who denied the claim.&lt;ref name=Apology&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/golf-woods-idUSGEE5B11VL20091202 |title=Tiger Woods admits "transgressions," apologizes |date=December 2, 2009 |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=January 23, 2012 |archive-date=April 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414012656/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/02/golf-woods-idUSGEE5B11VL20091202 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on November 27, Woods was driving from his Florida mansion in his [[Cadillac Escalade]] SUV when he collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges near his home.&lt;ref name=UsaT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/pga/2009-12-02-woods-crash-damage_N.htm |title=Woods crash did $3,200 damage to hydrant, tree |last=DiMeglio |first=Steve |date=December 3, 2009 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving.&lt;ref name=UsaT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/tiger-injured-in-latenight-car-accident-1830059.html |title=Tiger injured in late-night car accident |newspaper=The Independent |date=November 28, 2009 |access-date=January 23, 2012 |first=James |last=Corrigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following intense media speculation about the cause of the accident, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a "private matter" and crediting his wife for helping him from the car.&lt;ref&gt;
