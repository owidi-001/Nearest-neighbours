A former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|world No. 1]] in both singles and doubles, Williams is generally regarded as one of the all-time greats of women's tennis and, along with younger sister [[Serena Williams]], is credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael Kimmelman|title=How Power Has Transformed Women's Tennis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29Tennis-t.html?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1350759-the-williams-sisters-and-the-rise-of-the-womens-power-game|title=The Williams Sisters and the Rise of the Women's Power Game|first=JA|last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Karen Crouse|title=Williams Sisters Write Their Own Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/sports/tennis/31williams.html?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams has been ranked world No. 1 by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] for a total of 19 weeks (11 in singles and 8 in doubles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/press-center|title=Press Center|website=Women's Tennis Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first reached the No. 1 ranking in singles on February 25, 2002, becoming the first African American woman to do so in the [[Open Era]], and the second all time since [[Althea Gibson]]. She became the world No. 1 in doubles for the first time on June 7, 2010, alongside Serena, after the pair won their fourth consecutive Grand Slam doubles crown. Williams's seven [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles are tied for 12th on the all-time list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/stats/tennisrecords.php|title=Tennis records|publisher= Tennis X|access-date=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 8th on the Open Era list, more than any other active female player except her sister. She has reached 16 Grand Slam finals, most recently at Wimbledon in 2017. Her five Wimbledon singles titles tie her with two other women for eighth place on the all-time list. She is No. 4 on the Open Era List, behind the nine titles of [[Martina Navratilova]] and the seven of [[Serena Williams]] and [[Steffi Graf]]. From the [[2000 Wimbledon Championships]] to the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]], Williams won four of the six Grand Slam singles tournaments. At the [[2021 Wimbledon Championships]], Williams extended her record as the all-time leader, male or female, in Grand Slams played, with 90.&lt;ref&gt;https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/6/29/22555908/venus-williams-90th-wimbledon-win-in-90th-career-major&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tennisnow.com/News/2017/January/10-Stats-to-get-you-primed-for-the-2017-Australian.aspx|title = 10 Stats to get you primed for the 2017 Australian Open|access-date =January 18, 2017|publisher=Tennis Now|date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her run to the 2017 Wimbledon singles final, she broke the record for longest time between first and most recent grand slam singles finals appearances. Williams was twice the season prize money leader in 2001 and 2017, and currently ranks second behind Serena in career prize money earned with over $41.8 million. She has also won 14 Grand Slam Women's doubles titles, all with Serena Williams; the pair is unbeaten in Grand Slam doubles finals.&lt;sup&gt;[[Serena Williams#cite note-20|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Williams also has two Mixed Doubles titles. Her combined total of 23 Grand Slam titles across all disciplines is tied with [[Steffi Graf]] for the fourth-most by a women's player in the Open Era behind [[Martina Navratilova]], Serena, and [[Martina Hingis]].

Williams has won four [[Olympic gold medals]], one in singles and three in women's doubles with her sister, along with a silver medal in mixed doubles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/tennis/news/story?id=3539310|title = Williams sisters net gold in doubles, beating off Spaniards in final|access-date =April 22, 2009|publisher=ESPN|date=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; tying her with [[Kathleen McKane Godfree]] for the most Olympic medals won by a male or female tennis player in history. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Williams became only the second player to win Olympic gold medals in both singles and doubles at one Olympic Games, after [[Helen Wills Moody]] at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] (she was followed by her sister in 2012). After winning silver in mixed doubles with [[Rajeev Ram]] at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Williams became the first tennis player to win a medal at four Olympic games, as well as the first player in the Open Era to win an Olympic medal in all three events (singles, doubles, mixed). She and Serena are also the only tennis players in history with four Olympic gold medals, as well as the only ones to win Olympic gold in the same event on three occasions. She along with her sister Serena are the only Open Era female tennis players to win Olympic Gold in both singles and doubles category.

With 49 WTA singles titles, Williams trails only her sister Serena Williams among active players on the WTA Tour with most singles titles. Along with her 22 WTA doubles titles and two mixed doubles titles, Venus' combined total of 73 WTA titles is also second among active players behind Serena. Her 35-match winning streak from the 2000 Wimbledon Championships to the 2000 [[Generali Ladies Linz]] tournament final is the longest since January 1, 2000. She is also one of only two active WTA players to have reached the finals of all four Grand Slams, along with sister Serena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Chris|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Ranking-the-top-10-women-s-tennis-players-of-all?urn=ten-256242|title=Ranking the top-10 women's tennis players of all time – Busted Racquet – Tennis – Yahoo!

==Early life==
[[File:Venus and Serena 1993.jpg|thumb|Williams sisters at a [[Pam Shriver]] event in Baltimore, 1993]]
Williams was born in [[Lynwood, California]], to [[Richard Williams (tennis coach)|Richard Williams]] and [[Oracene Price]].&lt;ref&gt;Caple, Jim, [http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/13524355/back-compton-love-their-venus-serena "Back in Compton, 'They Love Their Venus and Serena'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227153314/http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/13524355/back-compton-love-their-venus-serena |date=December 27, 2015 }}, ''ESPN W''. August 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Her talents were apparent at the age of seven when a professional local tennis player named Tony Chesta spotted Williams and quickly identified her potential in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/venusserenawilli0000edmo|url-access=registration|title=Venus and Serena Williams: A Biography|last=Edmondson|first=Jacqueline|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313331657|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Williams family moved from [[Compton, California]], to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], when she was ten, so that she and her sister Serena could attend the tennis academy of [[Rick Macci]], who took notice of the sisters and who would provide additional coaching. He did not always agree with Williams's father but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|title = Venus, Serena reflect as they prepare for Fed Cup|publisher = blackathlete.net|access-date = April 22, 2009|first = Michelle|last = Kaufman|date = April 22, 2007|archive-date = July 8, 2012|archive-url = https://archive.today/20120708024727/http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was eleven, since he wanted them to take it slowly and focus on schoolwork. Another motivation was racial, as he had allegedly heard parents of other players disparage the Williams sisters during tournaments.&lt;ref name="Newsweek1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/122703/page/1 |title=Venus And Serena Against The World |first1=Marc |last1=Peyser |first2=Allison |last2=Samuels |date=August 24, 1998 |work=Newsweek |access-date=April 19, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Williams held a 63–0 record on the [[United States Tennis Association]] junior tour and was ranked No. 1&amp;nbsp;among the under-12 players in Southern California.&lt;ref name="Venus and Serena Williams by Lydia Pyle"&gt;Lydia Pyle, 2005, ''Venus and Serena Williams'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy, and from then on took over all coaching at their home.

==Playing style==
Williams is an aggressive player, with an all-court game. Due to her assertive playing style, she typically accumulates large numbers of both winners and unforced errors. She possesses powerful groundstrokes on both sides, and is capable of hitting both her forehand and backhand flat, and with topspin. She is also adept at hitting her backhand with slice, to slow down rallies and disrupt pace within rallies. Her serve is powerful, allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match. At the peak of her career, her first serve would average 113&amp;nbsp;mph (182&amp;nbsp;km/h), and would frequently peak at 124&amp;nbsp;mph (199&amp;nbsp;km/h); her serve has slowed since then, averaging 107&amp;nbsp;mph (172&amp;nbsp;km/h), and peaking at 117&amp;nbsp;mph (189&amp;nbsp;km/h). She possesses effective kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, preventing opponents from scoring free points. Up to 2014, Williams held the record for the fastest serve on the WTA Tour, recorded at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]], at 129&amp;nbsp;mph (208&amp;nbsp;km/h). Williams likes to approach the net, and finish points quickly. Her height, at 1.85m, provides her with a long arm span, allowing her to reach any ball whilst positioned at the net. She has a complete repertoire of shots to perform at the net, allowing her to hit deft volleys with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/sports/tennis/wimbledon-volley-serve.html|title=The Volley, Once a Huge Part of the Game, Is in Decline|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 2019|access-date=June 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to her all-court game, Williams is able to hit winners from any position on the court. While being an exceptional tactical player who possesses remarkable problem-solving skills, Williams also plays with sheer power and aggression. Williams relies on defense infrequently, rarely hitting drop shots and lobs, as her exceptional speed and court coverage allow her to hit with assertive power and strength from frequently defensive positions. Further strengths include her detailed and intricate footwork, and supreme athleticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/triumph-and-disaster-and-the-inspiring-late-career-play-of-venus-williams|title=Triumph and Disaster, and the Inspiring Late Career Play of Venus Williams|work=[[The New Yorker]]|last1=Marzorati|first1=Gerald|date=30 June 2017|access-date=20 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams has been noted for her elegant style of play, and she prefers to play on fast grass, hard, and carpet courts.

==Professional career==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2012}}

===1994–96: Professional debut===
Williams turned professional on October 31, 1994, at the age of fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Laurie Lanzen |last2=Abbey |first2=Cherie |title=Biography Today: Profiles of People of Interest to Young Readers |journal=Biography Today (1994 Annual Cumulation) : Profiles of People of Interest to Young Readers |date=1999 |publisher=Biography Today |location=Detroit, MI |issn=1058-2347 |pages=130–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second round of her first professional tournament, the [[Bank of the West Classic]] in Oakland, Williams was up a set and a service break against world No. 2 [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] before losing the match. No. 2 [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]], went on to win the Title defeating [[Martina Navratilova]]. That was the only tournament Williams played in 1994.

In 1995, Williams played three more events as a wild card, falling in the first round of the [[East West Bank Classic|tournament in Los Angeles]] and the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|tournament in Toronto]] but reaching the quarterfinals of the tournament in Oakland, defeating No. 18 [[Amy Frazier]] in the second round for her first win over a top 20 ranked player before losing to [[Magdalena Maleeva]].

Williams played five events in 1996, falling in the first round four times but reaching the third round in Los Angeles, before losing to No. 1 [[Steffi Graf]].

===1997–99: Early success===
====1997: Debut Grand Slam singles final====
Williams played 15 tour events in 1997, including five [[Tier I]] tournaments. She reached the quarterfinals in three of the Tier I events – the [[Pacific Life Open|State Farm Evert Cup]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], the [[Zürich Open|European Indoor Championships]] in Zürich, and the [[Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow. In Indian Wells in March, Williams defeated No. 9 [[Iva Majoli]] in the third round for her first win over a player ranked in the top 10. She then lost in the quarterfinals to No. 8 [[Lindsay Davenport]] in a third set tiebreak. Her ranking broke into the top 100 on April 14, 1997. She made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the French Open, reaching the second round before losing to [[Nathalie Tauziat]]. She then lost in the first round of Wimbledon to [[Magdalena Grzybowska]]. During her debut at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], she lost the final to [[Martina Hingis]] after defeating [[Irina Spîrlea]] in a semifinal which saw Spîrlea and Williams collide during a changeover when neither would yield as they passed the umpire's chair. [[Richard Williams (tennis coach)|Richard Williams]], her father, later claimed that this incident was racially motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.com/siforwomen/2000/sportswoman/venus_envy/|title=Venus Envy|publisher=Sportsillustrated.com|access-date=October 6, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714201259/http://sportsillustrated.com/siforwomen/2000/sportswoman/venus_envy/|archive-date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman since [[Pam Shriver]] in 1978 to reach a [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] singles final on her first attempt and was the first unseeded US Open women's singles finalist since 1958. On September 8, 1997, her ranking broke into the top 50 for the first time. She ended the year ranked No. 22

==== 1998: 1st WTA singles title, entering the top 10 and first Grand Slam doubles titles ====
In her debut at the [[1998 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Williams defeated younger sister Serena Williams in the second round, which was the sisters' first professional meeting. Williams eventually lost in the quarterfinals to No. 3 Davenport.

At the [[2008 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Williams was playing some of her best tennis since dominating the circuit in 2003, However, she was defeated in two tiebreaks by Serena Williams (the eventual tournament winner) in a close quarterfinal match, after Williams had led 5–3 in both sets.

At the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]] in October, Williams defeated a player ranked in the top three for the first time that season by defeating No. 3 [[Dinara Safina]] to reach her third semifinal of the year. There, she lost to Janković. A fortnight later, Williams won the [[Zurich Open]], defeating Ivanovic in the semifinals before defeating Pennetta in the final to claim her second title of the year and secure a position in the year-ending [[2008 WTA Tour Championships]] in [[Doha|Doha, Qatar]]. There, Williams defeated No. 2 Safina, No. 3 Serena Williams and No. 5 Dementieva in the preliminary round-robin stage. In the semifinals, Williams defeated No. 1 Janković before winning the year-ending tournament for the first time by defeating [[Vera Zvonareva]] in the final. She ended the year ranked No. 6 with three titles and a winning percentage of 78 percent.

====2009: Wimbledon runner-up and 4 consecutive Grand Slam doubles titles====
As the sixth seed at the [[2009 Australian Open]], Williams lost in the second round to [[Carla Suárez Navarro]] after holding a match point in the third set. However, she teamed up with her sister Serena to win the women's doubles title at the event, their eighth Grand Slam doubles title together. Williams rebounded in singles play in February at the Premier 5 (formerly Tier I) [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], defeating defending champion and No. 4 Dementieva in the quarterfinals and No. 1 Serena Williams in the semifinals on a third set tiebreak. The latter win meant that Williams led the head-to-head in career matches with her sister for the first time since 2002. Williams went on to defeat [[Virginie Razzano]] in the final. This win meant Williams was ranked in the top five for the first time since 2003, while it also marked her 40th professional singles title, only the twelfth player in the open era to achieve the feat.&lt;ref name="2009 Memphis win"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=3015|title=Williams Beats Razzano for 40th Career Singles Title}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams won another title the following week at the [[Abierto Mexicano Telcel]] in [[Acapulco, Mexico]], defeating Pennetta in the final. This was her first title on clay since 2005.

On European clay, Williams reached the semifinals in Rome before losing to No. 1 Safina. This run meant Williams was ranked in the top three for the first time since 2003. Seeded third at the [[2009 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], Williams lost to [[Ágnes Szávay]] in the third round, the third consecutive year she had exited at that stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/8073573.stm|title=Venus crashes out of French Open|date=May 29, 2009|work=BBC Sport |access-date=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was seeded third at [[2009 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]]. She advanced to her eighth Wimbledon final, at which point she had won 34 straight sets (held since Wimbledon 2007). In the final, however, she lost the first set tie-break, and from then on lost in two sets to sister Serena. The Williams sisters teamed up to win the doubles title at the tournament for the fourth time.

In [[2009 Bank of the West Classic|Stanford]], Williams defeated [[Maria Sharapova]] and [[Elena Dementieva]] to advance to the finals, where she would lose to [[Marion Bartoli]]. Teaming with her sister, she played doubles and won the title, defeating [[Monica Niculescu]] and [[Yung-Jan Chan]].
[[File:Venus at us open 2009-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Williams lost to the eventual champion, Kim Clijsters, at the US Open.]]
At the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]], as the third seed, Williams made it to the fourth round before losing to [[Kim Clijsters]] in three sets. Williams then teamed up with Serena Williams to play doubles at the open, where they won the title over defending champions and No. 1s in doubles, [[Cara Black]] and [[Liezel Huber]], claiming their third grand slam doubles title in 2009.

Williams's last tournament in 2009 was the year-ending [[2009 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]], where she was the defending champion in singles. She was in the maroon group which includes her sister Serena Williams, along with [[Elena Dementieva]] and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]]. She lost her first match against Dementieva, and her second match against her sister Serena- both in straight sets, after taking the first set. In her third and final RR match, Williams defeated [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]]. Because of Dementieva's loss to Kuznetsova in their round robin match, Williams advanced to the semifinal of the championships. In her semifinal match, she defeated [[Jelena Janković]] of Serbia to advance to her second consecutive final in the tournament. In the final, she lost to her sister Serena. In doubles, Williams teamed with her sister as the second seeds. However, they lost to [[Nuria Llagostera Vives]] and [[María José Martínez Sánchez]] in the semifinal. Their doubles record at the end of the year stood at 24–2.

Williams finished 2009 ranked No. 6 in singles (with a winning percentage of 70 percent) and No. 3 in doubles with Serena Williams, in spite of them playing only six events together that year.

====2010: No. 2 singles ranking and No. 1 doubles ranking====
Williams played at the [[2010 Australian Open|Australian Open]] as the sixth seed. She defeated 17th-seeded [[Francesca Schiavone]] in the fourth round. She was two points from defeating 16th-seeded [[Li Na]] in the quarterfinals before losing in three sets. In doubles, she teamed with her sister Serena to successfully defend their title, defeating the top-ranked team of [[Cara Black]] and [[Liezel Huber]] in the final. She went onto the [[clay courts|clay]] at the [[2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel|Abierto Mexico Telcel]] in Acapulco, where she was the defending champion. She reached the semifinals after recovering from a 1–5 third set deficit to [[Laura Pous Tió]] in the quarterfinals. In the final, she defeated first-time finalist [[Polona Hercog]] from Slovenia. This was her 43rd career title, the most among active female players.

Her next tournament was the Premier Mandatory [[2010 Sony Ericsson Open|Sony Ericsson Open]] in Key Biscayne, where she was seeded third. She defeated No. 9 [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] in the quarterfinals and No. 13 [[Marion Bartoli]] in the semifinals to reach her third straight WTA tour final and fourth Sony Ericsson Open final. She was defeated by [[Kim Clijsters]] in the final in just 58 minutes, ending her 15-match winning streak. By reaching the final, her ranking improved to No. 4 and she crossed the $26&amp;nbsp;million mark in career prize money, the only player besides Serena Williams to do so.

The knee injury that hampered her during the final of the Sony Ericsson Open forced her to skip the [[Fed Cup]] tie against Russia and the [[2010 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart. Williams returned to the tour at the Premier 5 [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome. She suffered the worst defeat of her career in the quarterfinals, losing to No. 4 [[Jelena Janković]] 6–0, 6–1. Despite this loss, Williams's ranking improved to No. 3 on May 10.

[[File:Venus Williams Madrid Open.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams at the 2010 Madrid Open]]
Her next tournament was the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Open]], a Premier Mandatory tournament. She lost to [[Aravane Rezaï]] in the final. In doubles, she teamed with her sister Serena to win the title.

On May 17, her ranking improved to No. 2, behind only Serena. This was the fourth time that the Williams sisters have occupied the top two spots, and the first time since May 2003.

Her next tournament was the [[2010 French Open|French Open]], where she played both singles and doubles despite her knee injury. Seeded second in singles, she advanced past the third round at this tournament for the first time since 2006 before losing to [[Nadia Petrova]] in the round of 16. She also played doubles with Serena as the top seeds. Their defeat of Huber and [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] in the semifinals increased their doubles ranking to No. 1. They then defeated 12th seeded [[Květa Peschke]] and [[Katarina Srebotnik]] in the final to win their fourth consecutive Grand Slam women's doubles title. By virtue of reaching the No. 1-ranking in doubles on June 7, 2010, Venus and Serena became just the 6th and 7th women to reach the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles following in the footsteps of Martina Navratilova, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, and Kim Clijsters.

Her next tournament was the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], where she had reached the final the previous three years. Despite her knee injury, she made it to the quarterfinals, where she lost to [[Tsvetana Pironkova]]. Pironkova was ranked No. 82 and had never gone past the second round of a Grand Slam event. As a result, Williams dropped to No. 4. She was the defending champion in doubles with her sister Serena, having won the tournament in the previous two years. However, they lost this time in the quarterfinals to [[Elena Vesnina]] and [[Vera Zvonareva]].

Williams then missed all tournaments in the [[2010 US Open Series|US Open Series]] because of a left knee injury but still participated at the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the third seed. She won three matches to move into the fourth round. Williams became one of only two women in 2010 (along with [[Caroline Wozniacki]]) to reach at least the fourth round at all four Grand Slam singles tournaments. Williams then defeated Pe'er and French Open champion Schiavone en route to her eighth US Open semifinal, against defending champion Clijsters. Williams won the first set of their match and recovered from 5–2 down in the second set but ultimately double-faulted on a key point near the end of the match and lost in three sets. Because of Serena's withdrawal from the US Open, Williams did not participate at the doubles event, where she was the defending champion.

The recovery of her left knee took longer than expected and it forced her to miss the rest of 2010, including the year-ending [[2010 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] and [[2010 Fed Cup|Fed Cup final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/venus_williams_out_for_the_remainder_of_2010_will_miss_fed_cup_final/ |title=Venus Williams out for the remainder of 2010; Will miss Fed Cup Final, Pro Tennis – News |publisher=USTA |date=October 6, 2010 |access-date=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams ended the year ranked fifth in singles, the first time she ended a year in the top five since 2002, while playing only nine tournaments. She finished the year ranked eleventh in doubles.

===2011–13: Injuries and illness===
====2011: Sjögrens Syndrome diagnosis====
[[File:Venus Williams 2011.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Williams during her first round match at the 2011 US Open]]
Williams began the year at the final edition of [[Hong Kong Tennis Classic]] exhibition event. She lost both her singles matches against [[Vera Zvonareva]] and [[Li Na]], but she helped Team America to win the silver group. At the [[Australian Open]], Williams retired in the second game of her third round match against [[Andrea Petkovic]] after sustaining a hip muscle injury in her second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/21/venus-williams-injury-withdraws-australian-open_n_812021.html |title=Venus Williams Injury: Tennis Star Withdraws From Australian Open |work=Huffington Post |access-date=May 17, 2011 |date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Williams's first retirement during a match in a Grand Slam tournament since 1994 and thus ended her record of most Grand Slam matches without ever retiring, with 250 consecutive matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/20110121/venus-retires-petkovic-moves-through_2256076_2272879 |title=Venus Retires, Petkovic Moves Through |publisher=Wtatennis.com |date=January 21, 2011 |access-date=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also her first retirement from a match since [[East West Bank Classic|LA Women's Tennis Championships]] in Los Angeles in 2004, ending her 294 consecutive matches without retiring. The injury forced Williams to pull out of the Fed Cup quarterfinal against Belgium, the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], and the Mexican Open, where she was the two-time defending champion in both tournaments. She subsequently withdrew from the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] causing her ranking to drop to number fifteen. She also missed the clay court season which caused her ranking to drop to number twenty-nine. Her absence from the [[2011 French Open|French Open]] marked the first Grand Slam tournament since the [[2003 US Open (tennis)|2003 US Open]] where neither of the Williams sisters were competing.

Williams then made her first appearance since the Australian Open in [[2011 Aegon International|Eastbourne]]. Unseeded, she lost for the first time in eleven meetings to [[Daniela Hantuchová]] in the quarterfinals. She was seeded 23rd at the [[2011 Wimbledon Championships]]. She played for nearly three hours in her second round match against Japanese veteran [[Kimiko Date-Krumm]], winning in three tough sets. She then defeated Spaniard [[María José Martínez Sánchez]] in the third round, but was defeated by Bulgarian 32nd seed [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] in the fourth round.

Originally scheduled to participate in the [[2011 Rogers Cup]] in [[Toronto]] and the [[2011 Western &amp; Southern Open]] in [[Cincinnati]], Williams withdrew due to viral illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Venus-Williams-Out-Again-For-The-Western---Souther.aspx |title=Venus Williams Out Again For The Western &amp; Southern Open |work=tennisnow.com |year=2011 |access-date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next scheduled tournament was the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Lauren|title=Venus Williams Out Again For The Western &amp; Southern Open|url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Venus-Williams-Out-Again-For-The-Western---Souther.aspx|publisher=Tennis Now|access-date=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unseeded at the US Open, Williams defeated [[Vesna Dolonts]] in the first round.

As a result, her ranking dropped to one-hundred and five.

Williams did not play for the rest of the year at a competitive level; she appeared in three exhibitions tournaments in November and early December. She played against sister Serena in Colombia, which she won in straight sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news?slug=ap-colombia-williamssisters|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201014524/http://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news?slug=ap-colombia-williamssisters|title=Venus defeats Serena in exhibition in Colombia|archivedate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week later, the sisters appeared in Milan, Italy to play exhibition against Italian duo [[Francesca Schiavone]] and [[Flavia Pennetta]].

==Rivalries==
===Venus vs. Serena Williams===
{{Main|Williams sisters rivalry}}Williams has played younger sister [[Serena Williams|Serena]] in 31 professional matches since 1998. Overall, Venus has won 12 of those matches and Serena Williams has won 19. They have met in 15 Grand Slam tournaments, with Venus Williams winning five matches to her sister Serena's ten. They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Venus winning twice. Of the six occasions where they met in an earlier round, the victor has gone on to win the championship four times (Venus once, in the [[2000 Wimbledon Championships]]).

Beginning with the [[2002 French Open]], they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals, which was the first time in the [[Tennis open era|open era]] that the same two players had contested four consecutive major finals.

===Williams vs. Hingis===
Williams and [[Martina Hingis|Hingis]] met 21 times during their careers. The overall head-to-head series is 11–10, in Hingis' favor. Their rivalry is one of the best in women's sports and has been called a "rivalry for the ages". The pair met in the 1997 US Open final during Williams's debut, Hingis won the match in straight sets.

===Williams vs. Davenport===
[[Lindsay Davenport|Davenport]] leads the rivalry 14–13 in their 27 professional matches. Williams leads 3–0 in Grand Slam Finals.

Williams won the match and also saved a match point, which makes her only the second woman in the Open Era to save a match point and go on to win a Major final.

==Fight for equal prize money==
Despite years of protesting by tennis pioneer [[Billie Jean King]] and others, in 2005 the French Open and Wimbledon still refused to pay women's and men's players equally through all rounds. In 2005, Williams met with officials from both tournaments, arguing that female tennis players should be paid as much as male tennis players.&lt;ref name=venus&gt;Williams, Venus.

The turning point was an essay published in ''[[The Times]]'' on the eve of Wimbledon in 2006.

Williams herself became the first woman to benefit from the equalization of prize money at Wimbledon, as she won the 2007 tournament and was awarded the same amount as the male winner [[Roger Federer]].

On December 21, 2017, authorities determined that the accident occurred after Williams's vehicle was unlawfully cut off by an unidentified driver of a third vehicle, making a left turn in front of Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Venus Williams deposed in fatal car crash case |publisher=[[ABC news]] |author=LUCHINA FISHER |date=November 9, 2017 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/venus-williams-deposed-fatal-car-crash-case/story?id=51038002 |access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nearby surveillance camera had recorded Williams lawfully entering the intersection.

===Business ventures===
Williams is the chief executive officer of her interior design firm V Starr Interiors located in [[Jupiter, Florida]]. Her company designed the set of the ''[[Tavis Smiley Show]]'' on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], the Olympic athletes' apartments as part of New York City's failed bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], and residences and businesses in the [[Palm Beach, Florida]], area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vstarrinteriors.com/default.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110041601/http://www.vstarrinteriors.com/default.htm|title=Vstarr Interiors|archivedate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Williams was named one of the 30 most powerful women in America by the ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="LHJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/powerindex_10012001.xml&amp;categoryid=/templatedata/lhj/category/data/c_297.xml&amp;page=5 |title=#21 to #25 |work=Ladies Home Journal }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Williams teamed with retailer [[Steve &amp; Barry's]] to launch her own fashion line, EleVen. "I love fashion and the idea that I am using my design education to actually create clothing and footwear that I will wear on and off the tennis court is a dream come true for me. The vision has been to create a collection that will allow women to enjoy an active lifestyle while remaining fashionable at the same time. I'm thrilled with everything we've created to launch EleVen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elevenbyvenus.com/|title=Eleven website|publisher=Elevenbyvenus.com|date=September 6, 2010|access-date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=1638|title=Venus Unveils EleVen Clothing Range}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams's line, EleVen, made its debut at the 2012 New York fashion week. It was modeled by athletes as opposed to models, a choice made by Williams herself to feature the sort of people the line was designed for. She flaunts her vibrant outfits each time she steps on the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/style/venus-williams-scores-at-new-york-fashion-week/|title=Venus Williams Scores at New York Fashion Week|date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Williams was named 77th in the [[Celebrity 100|Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities]] compiled by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="FMTC100"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/53/celebrity-09_Venus-Williams_ZX4E.html|title = #77 Venus Williams|work=Forbes Magazine|date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Venus Williams and her sister Serena Williams became part-owners of the [[Miami Dolphins]]. The announcement was made during a press conference overlooking the practice field. This made the sisters the first African-American women to obtain ownership in an NFL franchise. [[Stephen M. Ross]], the majority owner of the Dolphins, said "We are thrilled to have Venus and Serena Williams join the Dolphins as limited partners. They are among the most admired athletes in the world and have become global ambassadors for the game of tennis. Their addition to our ownership group further reflects our commitment to connect with aggressively and embrace the great diversity that makes South Florida a multicultural gem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4422313 Williams sisters buy into Dolphins group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119135510/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4422313 |date=January 19, 2016 }} ESPN, August 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2010, Williams released her first book, ''Come to Win; on How Sports Can Help You Top Your Profession'', which she co-wrote with Kelly E. Carter. In promotion of the book she embarked on a tour around America in support of the release, whilst also appearing on several talk shows, including ''[[The Early Show]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''. This gave her a place in the Top 5 of [[The New York Times Best Seller List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/venus_williams_book_on_nyt_bestseller_list/|title=Venus Williams book on NYT Bestseller list|publisher=Usta.com|date=July 15, 2010|access-date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, [[Tennis Channel]] aired a television series "100 greatest tennis players of all time", where she was ranked as 22nd. During the programme Williams was complimented by rival [[Lindsay Davenport]], with Davenport saying 'Venus had more power than any other player on tour'.
