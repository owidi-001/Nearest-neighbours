'''Punk rock''' (or simply '''punk''') is a [[music genre]] that emerged in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1960s [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often shouted political, [[anti-establishment]] lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through [[independent record label]]s.

The term "punk rock" was previously used by American [[Music criticism|rock critics]] in the early 1970s to describe the mid-1960s garage bands. Certain late 1960s and early 1970s Detroit acts, such as [[MC5]] and [[Iggy and The Stooges]], and others from elsewhere created out-of-the-mainstream music that became highly influential on what was to come.  [[Glam rock]] in the UK and [[The New York Dolls]] from New York have also been cited as key influences.  When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976, prominent acts included [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] in [[Brisbane punk rock|Brisbane]]; and the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in London, and the [[Buzzcocks]] in Manchester. By late 1976, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK.  It led to a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing]], such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewellery, safety pins, and bondage and S&amp;M clothes.

In 1977, the influence of the music and subculture spread worldwide. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the [[mainstream]].  In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[Oi!]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]]) and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Crass]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock.  Many musicians identifying with or inspired by punk went on to pursue other musical directions, giving rise to movements such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and [[alternative rock]].

===Outlook===
The first wave of punk rock was "aggressively modern" and differed from what came before.&lt;ref name="RMB"&gt;Robb (2006), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ramones]] drummer [[Tommy Ramone]], "In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] started noodling away. Soon you had endless [[Guitar solo|solos]] that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll."&lt;ref&gt;Ramone, Tommy, "Fight Club", ''[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]]'', January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Holmstrom]], founding editor of ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' magazine, recalls feeling "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [acts] like [[Billy Joel]] and [[Simon and Garfunkel]] were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music."&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;McLaren, Malcolm, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5263364.stm "Punk Celebrates 30 Years of Subversion"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115073013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5263364.stm |date=January 15, 2020 }}, BBC News, August 18, 2006. Retrieved on January 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Christgau]], punk "scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of [[hippie]] myth."&lt;ref&gt;Christgau, Robert, [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bkrev/mcneil-nyt.php "''Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk'', by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain" (review)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020182250/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bkrev/mcneil-nyt.php |date=October 20, 2019 }}, ''New York Times Book Review'', 1996.

Technical accessibility and a [[do it yourself]] (DIY) spirit are prized in punk rock. [[UK pub rock]] from 1972 to 1975 contributed to the emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play.&lt;ref name="Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18"&gt;Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''. PM Press, 2015. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Pub rock also introduced the idea of [[independent record label]]s, such as [[Stiff Records]], which put out basic, low-cost records.&lt;ref name="Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18"/&gt; Pub rock bands organized their own small venue tours and put out small pressings of their records. In the early days of punk rock, this DIY ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands.&lt;ref&gt;Rodel (2004), p. 237; Bennett (2001), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was "rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music".&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; In December 1976, the English [[fanzine]] ''Sideburns'' published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned "This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band".&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992), pp. 280–281, including reproduction of the original image. Several sources incorrectly ascribe the illustration to the leading fanzine of the London punk scene, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'' (e.g., Wells [2004], p. 5; Sabin [1999], p. 111). Robb (2006) ascribes it to [[the Stranglers]]' in-house fanzine, ''Strangled'' (p. 311).&lt;/ref&gt;

British punk rejected contemporary mainstream rock, the broader culture it represented, and their music predecessors: "No [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]] or [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1977", declared [[the Clash]] song "1977".&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2004), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; 1976, when the punk revolution began in Britain, became a musical and a cultural "Year Zero".&lt;ref name="Reynolds p4"&gt;Reynolds (2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude summed up by the [[Sex Pistols]] slogan "No Future";&lt;ref name="RMB"/&gt; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, Stuart. "A Right Royal Knees-Up". ''The Guardian''. July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While "self-imposed [[social alienation|alienation]]" was common among "drunk punks" and "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the "radical leftist utopianism"&lt;ref&gt;Washburne, Christopher, and Maiken Derno. ''Bad Music''. Routledge, 2004. Page 247.&lt;/ref&gt; of bands such as [[Crass]], who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer [[Joe Strummer]]'s outlook, "Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be able to do what we want to do."&lt;ref&gt;Kosmo Vinyl, ''The Last Testament: The Making of London Calling'' (Sony Music, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]] has always been important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term "[[poseur]]" is applied to those who adopt its stylistic attributes but do not to share or understand its underlying values and philosophy. Scholar Daniel S. Traber argues that "attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult"; as the punk scene matured, he observes, eventually "everyone got called a poseur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=30–64 |doi=10.1353/cul.2001.0040 |title=L.A.'s 'White Minority': Punk and the Contradictions of Self-Marginalization |year=2001 |last1=Traber |first1=Daniel S. |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early punk bands emulated the minimal musical arrangements of 1960s [[garage rock]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Peter, "Shine On, The Lights Of The Bowery: The Blank Generation Revisited," ''Hot Press'', July 12, 2002; [[Barney Hoskyns|Hoskyns, Barney]], "Richard Hell: King Punk Remembers the [ ] Generation," ''[[Rock's Backpages]]'', March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical punk rock instrumentation is stripped down to one or two guitars, bass, drums and vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other rock genres, and played at fast tempos.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''. PM Press, 2015. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll [[verse-chorus form]] and 4/4 [[time signature]]. However, later bands have often broken from this format. In critic [[Steven Blush]]'s description, "The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll ... like the craziest version of [[Chuck Berry]]. [[Hardcore punk|Hardcore]] was a radical departure from that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form."&lt;ref name="blush"&gt;[[Steven Blush|Blush, Steven]], "Move Over My Chemical Romance: The Dynamic Beginnings of US Punk," ''[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]]'', January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocals are sometimes nasal,&lt;ref&gt;Wells (2004), p. 41; Reed (2005), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lyrics are often shouted in an "arrogant snarl", rather than sung in the conventional sense.&lt;ref name="S159"&gt;Shuker (2002), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laing 21"&gt;Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''. PM Press, 2015. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Complicated [[guitar solo]]s were considered self-indulgent, although basic guitar breaks were common.&lt;ref&gt;Chong, Kevin, [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/guitarsolos.html "The Thrill Is Gone"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203054425/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/guitarsolos.html |date=December 3, 2010 }}, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, August 2006. Retrieved on December 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Guitar parts tend to include highly [[distortion pedal|distorted]] [[power chord]]s or [[barre chord]]s, creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a "buzzsaw drone".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Laing|1985|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some punk rock bands take a [[surf music|surf rock]] approach with a lighter, twangier guitar tone. Others, such as [[Robert Quine]], lead guitarist of [[the Voidoids]], have employed a wild, "[[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]" attack, a style that stretches back through [[the Velvet Underground]] to the 1950s' recordings of [[Ike Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1992), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential approach is a relentless, repetitive "forced rhythm",{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=62}} although some punk rock bass players—such as [[Mike Watt]] of [[Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]] and [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]]—emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a [[Plectrum|pick]] due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes [[fingerpicking]] impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up. Compared to other forms of rock, [[syncopation]] is much less the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Laing|1985|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardcore drumming tends to be especially fast.&lt;ref name="S159"/&gt; Production tends to be minimalistic, with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recorders{{sfn|Laing|1985|pp=118–19}} or simple four-track portastudios.{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=53}}

Punk rock lyrics are typically frank and confrontational; compared to the lyrics of other popular music genres, they frequently comment on social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin (1999), pp. 4, 226; Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock", ''Vox'', June 1993. See also Laing (1985), pp. 27–32, for a statistical comparison of lyrical themes.&lt;/ref&gt; Trend-setting songs such as the Clash's "[[Career Opportunities (song)|Career Opportunities]]" and [[Chelsea (band)|Chelsea]]'s "Right to Work" deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life.&lt;ref&gt;Laing (1985), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in early British punk, a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Laing (1985), pp. 81, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sex Pistols'  "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]" and "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" openly disparaged the British political system and social mores. Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in "Love Comes in Spurts", recorded by the Voidoids. [[Anomie]], variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's "[[Blank Generation (song)|Blank Generation]]" and the bluntness of the Ramones' "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", is a common theme.&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1991), p. 440. See also Laing (1985), pp. 27–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial content of punk lyrics led to some punk records being banned by radio stations and refused shelf space in major chain stores.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''. PM Press, 2015. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Christgau said that "Punk is so tied up with the disillusions of growing up that punks do often age poorly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=April 14, 2021|url=https://robertchristgau.substack.com/p/xgau-sez-april-2021|title=Xgau Sez: April, 2021|work=And It Don't Stop|publisher=[[Substack]]|access-date=April 17, 2021|url-access=subscription|archive-date=April 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417124959/https://robertchristgau.substack.com/p/xgau-sez-april-2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Details|Punk fashion}}

The classic punk rock look among male American musicians harkens back to the T-shirt, motorcycle jacket, and jeans ensemble favored by American [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] of the 1950s associated with the [[rockabilly]] scene and by British [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]] of the 1960s. In addition to the T-shirt, and leather jackets they wore ripped jeans and boots, typically Doc Martens. The punk look was inspired to shock people. Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look—and reputed invention of the [[safety pin#Culture|safety-pin aesthetic]]—was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario [[Malcolm McLaren]] and, in turn, British punk style.&lt;ref name="RHV"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Isler, Scott |author2=Robbins, Ira |title=Richard Hell &amp; the Voidoids |work=[[Trouser Press]] |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=richard_hell_and_the_voidoids |access-date=2007-10-23 |archive-date=October 22, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022221054/http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=richard_hell_and_the_voidoids |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[John D Morton]] of Cleveland's [[Electric Eels (band)|Electric Eels]] may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety-pin-covered jacket.)&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|author=Weldon, Michael|title=Electric Eels: Attendance Required|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index_story.ssf?/music/more/local/cle/2/index.html|publisher=Cleveland.com|access-date=December 19, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123003715/http://www.cleveland.com/music/index_story.ssf?%2Fmusic%2Fmore%2Flocal%2Fcle%2F2%2Findex.html|archive-date=January 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLaren's partner, fashion designer [[Vivienne Westwood]], credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk to rip his shirt, and Sex Pistols bassist [[Sid Vicious]] as the first to use safety pins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Young, Charles M. |date=October 20, 1977| title=Rock Is Sick and Living in London |work=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/articles/story/9437647/sex_pistols_rock_is_sick_and_living_in_london?source=thebeatles_rssfeed |access-date=October 10, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914225550/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/articles/story/9437647/sex_pistols_rock_is_sick_and_living_in_london?source=thebeatles_rssfeed |archive-date=September 14, 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; although few of those following punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood's designs so famously worn by the Pistols, so they made their own, diversifying the 'look' with various different styles based on these designs.

The early to mid-1960s garage rock bands are often recognized as punk rock's progenitors. [[The Kingsmen]]'s "[[Louie, Louie]]" is often cited as punk rock's defining "[[Urtext edition|ur-text]]".{{sfn|Sabin|1999|p=157}}{{refn|group=nb|In the Kingsmen's version, the song's "El Loco Cha-Cha" riffs were pared down to a more simple and primitive rock arrangement providing a stylistic model for countless garage rock bands.&lt;ref name="Pareles (Berry Obituary)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pareles|first1=Jon|title=Richard Berry, Songwriter of 'Louie Louie,' Dies at 61|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/25/arts/richard-berry-songwriter-of-louie-louie-dies-at-61.html|website=New York Times|access-date=April 27, 2016|date=January 25, 1997|archive-date=March 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326174905/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/25/arts/richard-berry-songwriter-of-louie-louie-dies-at-61.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avant-Mier, Roberto (2008).

From England in 1964, largely under the influence of the [[Mod subculture|mod]] youth movement and beat group explosion, came the Kinks' hit singles, "[[You Really Got Me]]" and "[[All Day and All of the Night]]," both influenced by "Louie, Louie".&lt;ref&gt;Kitts, Thomas M.

In August 1969, [[the Stooges]], from [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], premiered with a [[The Stooges (album)|self-titled album]]. According to critic [[Greil Marcus]], the band, led by singer [[Iggy Pop]], created "the sound of [[Chuck Berry]]'s [[You Can't Catch Me|Airmobile]]—after thieves stripped it for parts".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus (1979), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The album was produced by [[John Cale]], a former member of New York's experimental rock group [[the Velvet Underground]], who inspired many of those involved in the creation of punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Dolls]] updated 1950s' rock 'n' roll in a fashion that later became known as [[glam punk]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrington (2002), p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York duo [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] played spare, experimental music with a confrontational stage act inspired by that of the Stooges.&lt;ref&gt;Bessman (1993), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, [[the Modern Lovers]], led by [[Jonathan Richman]], minimalistic style gained attention.

==Etymology==
[[Greg Shaw]] was the first music critic to employ the term: In the April 1971 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he refers to a track by [[The Guess Who]] as "good, not too imaginative, punk rock and roll". [[Dave Marsh]] used the term in the May 1971 issue of ''[[Creem]]'', where he described [[Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians|? and the Mysterians]] as giving a "landmark exposition of punk rock".&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro (2006), p. 492. Note that Taylor (2003) misidentifies the year of publication as 1970 (p. 16).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1971, in his fanzine ''[[Bomp!|Who Put the Bomp]]'', [[Greg Shaw]] wrote about "what I have chosen to call "punkrock" bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 ([[Standells]], Kingsmen, [[Shadows of Knight]], etc.)".&lt;ref&gt;Gendron (2002), p. 348 n. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|[[Robert Christgau]] writing for the Village Voice in October 1971 refers to "mid-60s punk" as a historical period of rock-and-roll.&lt;ref name="Christgau (60s punk)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christgau|first1=Robert|title=Consumer Guide (20)|journal=Village Voice|date=October 14, 1971|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg20.php|access-date=July 23, 2016|archive-date=September 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903214950/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg20.php|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Lester Bangs]] used the term "punk rock" in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts.{{sfn|Bangs|2003|pp=8, 56, 57, 61, 64, 101}}

In the liner notes of the 1972 anthology LP, ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968|Nuggets]]'', musician and rock journalist [[Lenny Kaye]], later a member of the Patti Smith Group, used the term "punk rock" to describe the genre of 1960s garage bands and "garage-punk," to describe a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight.&lt;ref name="letitrock"&gt;Houghton, Mick, "White Punks on Coke," ''Let It Rock''. December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the January 1973 ''Rolling Stone'' review of ''Nuggets'', Greg Shaw commented "Punk rock is a fascinating genre...

In May 1974, ''Los Angeles Times'' critic [[Robert Hilburn]] reviewed the second New York Dolls album, ''[[Too Much Too Soon (album)|Too Much Too Soon]]''. "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," he wrote, describing the album as "perhaps the best example of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Hilburn, Robert, "Touch of Stones in Dolls' Album," ''Los Angeles Times'', May 7, 1974, p.

By 1975, ''punk'' was being used to describe acts as diverse as the [[Patti Smith|Patti Smith Group]], the [[Bay City Rollers]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]].&lt;ref name="sav131"&gt;Savage (1991), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; As the scene at New York's [[CBGB]] club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner [[Hilly Kristal]] called the movement ''"Street rock"''; [[John Holmstrom]] credits ''[[The Aquarian Weekly|Aquarian]]'' magazine with using ''punk'' "to describe what was going on at CBGBs".&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1991), pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmstrom, [[Legs McNeil]], and Ged Dunn's magazine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'', which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. We wanted to get rid of the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back."&lt;ref name="sav131" /&gt;

==1974–1976: Early history==
===North America===
====New York City====
The origins of New York's punk rock scene can be traced back to such sources as late 1960s [[trash culture]] and an early 1970s [[underground rock]] movement centered on the [[Mercer Arts Center]] in [[Greenwich Village]], where the [[New York Dolls]] performed.{{sfn|Savage|1991|pp=86–90, 59–60}} In early 1974, a new scene began to develop around the [[CBGB]] club, also in [[lower Manhattan]]. At its core was [[Television (band)|Television]], described by critic John Walker as "the ultimate garage band with pretensions".&lt;ref name="W"&gt;Walker (1991), p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt; Their influences ranged from the Velvet Underground to the staccato guitar work of [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]]'s [[Wilko Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Strongman (2008), pp. 53, 54, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's bassist/singer, [[Richard Hell]], created a look with cropped, ragged hair, ripped T-shirts, and black leather jackets credited as the basis for punk rock visual style.&lt;ref name="S89"&gt;Savage (1992), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1974, [[Patti Smith]] came to CBGB for the first time to see the band perform.&lt;ref&gt;Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; A veteran of independent theater and performance poetry, Smith was developing an intellectual, feminist take on rock 'n' roll. On June 5, she recorded the single "[[Hey Joe]]"/"[[Piss Factory]]", featuring Television guitarist [[Tom Verlaine]]; released on her own Mer Records label, it heralded the scene's [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ethic and has often been cited as the first punk rock record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patti Smith—Biography|publisher=Arista Records|url=http://www.arista.com/psmith/smithbio.html|access-date=2007-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103053048/http://www.arista.com/psmith/smithbio.html |archive-date=November 3, 2007|url-status=dead}} Strongman (2008), p. 57; Savage (1991), p. 91; Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 511; Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; By August, Smith and Television were gigging together at [[Max's Kansas City]].&lt;ref name="S89"/&gt;

In [[Forest Hills, Queens]], the [[Ramones]] drew on sources ranging from the Stooges to [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] to [[Herman's Hermits]] and 1960s [[girl group]]s, and condensed rock 'n' roll to its primal level: "'1-2-3-4!' bass-player [[Dee Dee Ramone]] shouted at the start of every song, as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm."{{sfn|Savage|1991|pp=90–91}} The band played its first show at CBGB in August 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Gimarc (2005), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;Bessman (1993), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; "When I first saw the Ramones", critic [[Mary Harron]] later remembered, "I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness."{{sfn|Savage|1991|pp=132–33}}

That spring, Smith and Television shared a two-month-long weekend residency at CBGB that significantly raised the club's profile.&lt;ref&gt;Bockris and Bayley (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The Television sets included Richard Hell's "Blank Generation", which became the scene's emblematic anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992) claims that "Blank Generation" was written around this time (p. 90). However, the Richard Hell anthology album ''Spurts'' includes a live Television recording of the song that he dates "spring 1974."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Hell left Television and founded a band featuring a more stripped-down sound, [[the Heartbreakers]], with former New York Dolls [[Johnny Thunders]] and [[Jerry Nolan]].&lt;ref name="RHV"/&gt; In August, Television recorded a single, "Little Johnny Jewel". In the words of John Walker, the record was "a turning point for the whole New York scene" if not quite for the punk rock sound itself—Hell's departure had left the band "significantly reduced in fringe aggression".&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

"This is as pure, and as energetic, as rock rhythm gets."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2008), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early in 1976, Hell left the Heartbreakers to form [[the Voidoids]], described as "one of the most harshly uncompromising [punk] bands".&lt;ref&gt;Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; That April, the Ramones' debut album was released by [[Sire Records]]; the first single was "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]", opening with the rally cry "Hey! Ho! Let's go!" According to a later description, "Like all cultural watersheds, ''[[Ramones (album)|Ramones]]'' was embraced by a discerning few and slagged off as a bad joke by the uncomprehending majority."&lt;ref name="trouser3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramones|author1=Isler, Scott|author2=Robbins, Ira|work=Trouser Press|url=http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=ramones|access-date=2007-10-23|archive-date=November 2, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102185040/http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=ramones|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New York venues apart from CBGB included the Lismar Lounge (41 First Avenue) and Aztec Lounge (9th Street).&lt;ref&gt;''New York'', Volume 20, Page 67 1987 "Lismar Lounge (41 First Avenue, near 3rd Street). The Love Club is no more (it operated in the basement till a month ago). ... When people talk about the punk scene at CBGB, they mean the Sunday matinee performances. For $5 ... Aztec Lounge This is only partly punk—the bar crowd is actually friendly."&lt;/ref&gt;

At this early stage, the term ''punk'' applied to the scene in general, not necessarily a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2006), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitué, [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]], auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the [[Sex Pistols]] on November 6, 1975, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], and soon attracted a small but dedicated following.&lt;ref&gt;Gimarc (2005), p. 22; Robb (2006), p. 114; Savage (1992), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1976, the band received its first significant press coverage; guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were "chaos".&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992), pp. 151–152. The quote has been incorrectly ascribed to McLaren (e.g., Laing [1985], pp. 97, 127) and Rotten (e.g., [https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A791336 "Punk Music in Britain"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730180831/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A791336 |date=July 30, 2011 }}, BBC, October 7, 2002), but Savage directly cites the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' issue in which the quote originally appeared. Robb (2006), p. 148, also describes the ''NME'' article in some detail and ascribes the quote to Jones.&lt;/ref&gt; The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, "Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Friedlander and Miller (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, "hard and tough".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by critic [[Jon Savage]], the band members "embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references: late-sixties radical politics, sexual fetish material, pop history, ... youth sociology".&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Rhodes]], a  associate of McLaren, similarly aimed to make stars of the band [[London SS]], who became the [[the Clash]], which was joined by [[Joe Strummer]].&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992), pp. 124, 171, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]] in what became one of the most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed [[Buzzcocks]] after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form [[Joy Division]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], and—in the 1980s—[[the Smiths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-06-27 |title=Sex Pistols Gig: The Truth |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/05/11/110506_sex_pistols_gig_feature.shtml |access-date=2007-12-29 |archive-date=December 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224054741/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/05/11/110506_sex_pistols_gig_feature.shtml |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the Ramones played two London shows that helped spark the nascent UK punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 56; McNeil and McCain (2006), pp. 230–233; Robb (2006), pp. 198, 201.

There were female bassists [[Gaye Advert]] in [[the Adverts]] and [[Shanne Bradley]] in [[the Nipple Erectors]], while Sex store frontwoman [[Pamela Rooke|Jordan]] not only managed [[Adam and the Ants]] but also performed screaming vocals on their song "Lou". Other groups included [[Subway Sect]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[The Stranglers]] and [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]]. Farther afield, [[Sham 69]] began practicing in the southeastern town of [[Hersham]]. In [[Durham, England|Durham]], there was [[Penetration (band)|Penetration]], with lead singer [[Pauline Murray]]. On September 20–21, the [[100 Club Punk Festival]] in London featured The Sex Pistols, Clash, Damned and Buzzcocks, as well as Paris's female-lead [[Stinky Toys]]. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night. On the festival's second night, audience member [[Sid Vicious]] was arrested having thrown a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident reinforced punk's reputation as a social menace.&lt;ref&gt;Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 111; Gimarc (2005), p. 39; Robb (2006), pp. 217, 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some new bands, such as London's [[Alternative TV]], Edinburgh's [[Rezillos]], and [[Royal Leamington Spa|Leamington]]'s [[The Shapes (British band)|the Shapes]], identified with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: [[the Vibrators]], formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound.&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992), pp. 221, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; A few even longer-active bands including [[Surrey]] neo-mods [[the Jam]] and pub rockers [[the Stranglers]] and [[Cock Sparrer]] also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early [[The Who|Who]], the British punks also reflected the influence of [[glam rock]] and related bands such as [[Slade]], [[T. Rex (band)|T.Rex]], and [[Roxy Music]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin (1993), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A punk subculture began in Australia around the same time, centered around [[Radio Birdman]] and the Oxford Tavern in Sydney's [[Darlinghurst]] suburb. By 1976, [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] were hiring Brisbane [[Hall (concept)#Public halls|local halls]] to use as venues, or playing in "Club 76", their shared house in the inner suburb of [[Brisbane central business district|Petrie Terrace]]. The band soon discovered that musicians were exploring similar paths in other parts of the world. [[Ed Kuepper]], co-founder of the Saints, later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One thing I remember having had a really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it [in 1976], I mean it was a great record&amp;nbsp;... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a [[chord progression]] on that album that we used&amp;nbsp;... and I thought, "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clinton Walker|Walker, Clinton]] (1996), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Perth]], the [[The Manikins|Cheap Nasties]] formed in August.&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane (1999), p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1976, the Saints became the first punk rock band outside the U.S. to release a recording, the single "[[(I'm) Stranded (song)|(I'm) Stranded]]".

Scores of new punk groups formed around the United Kingdom, as far from London as [[Belfast]]'s [[Stiff Little Fingers]] and [[Dunfermline]], Scotland's [[the Skids]]. Though most survived only briefly, perhaps recording a small-label single or two, others set off new trends. [[Crass]], from [[Essex]], merged a vehement, straight-ahead punk rock style with a committed anarchist mission, and played a major role in the emerging [[anarcho-punk]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swash|first1=Rosie|title=Crass's political punk is as relevant now as ever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/24/crass-penny-rimbaud-steve-ignorant|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=March 26, 2015|date=2010-10-23|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112739/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/24/crass-penny-rimbaud-steve-ignorant|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sham 69, London's Menace, and the [[Angelic Upstarts]] from [[South Shields]] in the Northeast combined a similarly stripped-down sound with populist lyrics, a style that became known as [[street punk]]. These expressly working-class bands contrasted with others in the second wave that presaged the [[post-punk]] phenomenon. Liverpool's first punk group, [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]], moved in a glam, theatrical direction.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), pp. 365, 378.&lt;/ref&gt; The band didn't survive long, but it spun off several well-known post-punk acts.&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1991), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs of London's [[Wire (band)|Wire]] were characterized by sophisticated lyrics, minimalist arrangements, and extreme brevity.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), pp. 170–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspiring yet another round of controversy, it topped the British charts. In December, one of the first books about punk rock was published: ''The Boy Looked at Johnny'', by [[Julie Burchill]] and [[Tony Parsons (British journalist)|Tony Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;The title echoes a lyric from the title track of Patti Smith's 1975 album ''Horses''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979, the [[hardcore punk]] movement was emerging in [[Southern California]]. A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as "Hollywood punks" and "beach punks", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].&lt;ref&gt;Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217–32; Stark (2006), "Dissolution" (pp. 91–93); see also, [http://flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html "Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604162955/http://www.flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html |date=June 4, 2007 }} (Flipsidezine.com article archive).&lt;/ref&gt;

As hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up.&lt;ref&gt;Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between "classic" punk, [[post-punk]], and hardcore, San Francisco's [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.&lt;ref&gt;See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208–11.&lt;/ref&gt; They became "the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years".&lt;ref&gt;Dougan, John.

Radio Birdman broke up in June 1978 while touring the UK,&lt;ref name="M507"&gt;McFarlane (1999), p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; where the early unity between [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], middle-class punks (many with art school backgrounds) and [[working class|working-class]] punks had disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), pp. 1–2, 17; Laing (1985), p. 109; Savage (1991), p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to North America, more of the bands from the original British punk movement remained active, sustaining extended careers even as their styles evolved and diverged. Meanwhile, the [[Oi!]] and [[anarcho-punk]] movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, "The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&amp;nbsp;... It became essential to sound one particular way to be recognized as a 'punk band' now."&lt;ref&gt;Laing (1985), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1979, former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious died of a heroin overdose in New York. If the Sex Pistols' breakup the previous year had marked the end of the original UK punk scene and its promise of cultural transformation, for many the death of Vicious signified that it had been doomed from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1992), p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the decade, the punk rock movement had split deeply along cultural and musical lines, leaving a variety of derivative scenes and forms. On one side were [[New wave music|new wave]] and post-punk artists; some adopted more accessible musical styles and gained broad popularity, while some turned in more experimental, less commercial directions. On the other side, hardcore punk, Oi!, and anarcho-punk bands became closely linked with underground cultures and spun off an array of [[cross-genre|subgenres]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere in between, [[pop punk]] groups created blends like that of the ideal record, as defined by [[Mekons]] cofounder Kevin Lycett: "a cross between [[ABBA|Abba]] and the Sex Pistols".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wells (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A range of other styles emerged, many of them [[Fusion (music)|fusions]] with long-established genres. The Clash album ''[[London Calling]]'', released in December 1979, exemplified the breadth of classic punk's legacy.

In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—"New Wave" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as "punk"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron (2002), pp. 269–74.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' journalist [[Roy Carr]] is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic [[French New Wave]] of the 1960s) in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Strongman (2008), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, "new wave" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Talking Heads]] from the CBGB scene; [[the Cars]], who emerged from the Rat in Boston; [[the Go-Go's]] in Los Angeles; and [[the Police]] in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated "new wave" and no longer called "punk". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.&lt;ref&gt;Laing (1985), pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less "dangerous" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Wojcik (1995), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; New wave became a catch-all term,&lt;ref&gt;Schild, Matt, [http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=292 "Stuck in the Future"], Aversion.com, July 11, 2005.

Some bands classified as post-punk, such as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], had been active well before the punk scene coalesced;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; others, such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[the Slits]], transitioned from punk rock into post-punk. A few months after the Sex Pistols' breakup, [[John Lydon]] (no longer "Rotten") cofounded [[Public Image Ltd]]. [[Lora Logic]], formerly of X-Ray Spex, founded [[Essential Logic]]. [[Killing Joke]] formed in 1979. These bands were often musically experimental; the term "post-punk" is used to describe sounds that were  more dark and abrasive—sometimes verging on the [[atonality|atonal]], as with Subway Sect and Wire. The bands incorporated a range of  influences ranging from [[Syd Barrett]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[David Bowie]] to [[Roxy Music]] to [[Krautrock]].

Post-punk brought together a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably [[Geoff Travis]] of [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] and [[Tony Wilson]] of [[Factory Records|Factory]], helped to develop the production and distribution infrastructure of the [[independent music|indie music]] scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), pp. xxvii, xxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Smoothing the edges of their style in the direction of new wave, several post-punk bands such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[The Cure]] crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience.  Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive style of punk, characterized by superfast, aggressive beats, [[screaming (music)|screaming vocals]], and often politically aware lyrics, began to emerge in 1978 among bands scattered around the United States and Canada. The first major scene of what came to be known as hardcore punk developed in Southern California in 1978–79, initially around such punk bands as the Germs and [[Fear (band)|Fear]].&lt;ref&gt;Blush (2001), pp. 16–17; Sabin (1999) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The movement soon spread around North America and internationally.&lt;ref name="andersen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hardcore"/&gt; According to author [[Steven Blush]], "Hardcore comes from the bleak suburbs of America. Parents moved their kids out of the cities to these horrible suburbs to save them from the 'reality' of the cities and what they ended up with was this new breed of monster".&lt;ref name="blush"/&gt;

Among the earliest hardcore bands, regarded as having made the first recordings in the style, were Southern California's [[Middle Class (band)|Middle Class]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].&lt;ref name="hardcore"&gt;Blush (2001), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bad Brains]] — all of whom were black, a rarity in punk of any era — launched the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|D.C. scene]] with their rapid-paced single '[[Pay to Cum]]" in 1980.&lt;ref name="andersen"&gt;Andersen and Jenkins (2001). {{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austin, Texas]]'s [[Big Boys]], San Francisco's [[Dead Kennedys]], and [[Vancouver]]'s [[D.O.A.

By 1981, hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California, but much of the rest of North America as well.&lt;ref&gt;Blush (2001), pp. 12–21.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New York hardcore]] scene grew, including the relocated Bad Brains, New Jersey's [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] and [[Adrenalin O.D.]], and local acts such as [[The Mob (American hardcore band)|the Mob]], [[Reagan Youth]], and [[Agnostic Front]]. [[Beastie Boys]], who would become famous as a hip-hop group, debuted that year as a hardcore band. They were followed by [[the Cro-Mags]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], and [[Leeway (band)|Leeway]].&lt;ref&gt;Andersen and Jenkins (2001), p. 89; Blush (2001), p. 173; {{cite web|author=Diamond, Mike|title=Beastie Boys Biography|publisher=Sing365.com|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Beastie-Boys-Biography/0B982363068317484825682C0009A5AE|access-date=2008-01-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504005325/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Beastie-Boys-Biography/0B982363068317484825682C0009A5AE|archive-date=May 4, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, [[Minneapolis hardcore|St. Paul]]'s [[Hüsker Dü]], Willful Neglect, Chicago's [[Naked Raygun]], [[Indianapolis]]'s [[Zero Boys]], and D.C.'s [[The Faith (American band)|the Faith]] were taking the hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions.&lt;ref name='guardian'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/27/faith-void-dischord-washington-hardcore-punk | title = The Faith and Void: the glorious Dischord of 1980s harDCore punk | access-date = 2012-08-16 | last = Finn | first = Craig | date = 2011-10-27 | work = [[The Guardian]] | archive-date = October 6, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006064138/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/27/faith-void-dischord-washington-hardcore-punk | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Leblanc (1999), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle-class values, as in Dead Kennedys' celebrated "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]" (1980).&lt;ref name="vandorston"&gt;Van Dorston, A.S., [https://web.archive.org/web/20000510062822/http://www.fastnbulbous.com/punk.htm "A History of Punk"], fastnbulbous.com, January 1990.

[[Straight edge]] bands like Minor Threat, [[Boston hardcore|Boston]]'s [[SS Decontrol]], and [[Reno, Nevada]]'s [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]] rejected the self-destructive lifestyles of their peers, and built a movement based on positivity and abstinence from cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and casual sex.&lt;ref&gt;Haenfler (2006) {{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skate punk innovators pointed in other directions: including [[Venice, California]]'s [[Suicidal Tendencies]] who had a formative effect on the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]–influenced [[crossover thrash]] style.

Following the lead of first-wave British punk bands [[Cock Sparrer]] and [[Sham 69]], in the late 1970s second-wave groups like [[Cockney Rejects]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[the Exploited]], and [[the 4-Skins]] sought to realign punk rock with a working class, street-level following.{{sfn|Sabin|1999|loc=p. 216 n. 17}}&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Stephen, "Revolution Rock", Vox, June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; They believed the music needed to stay "accessible and unpretentious", in the words of music historian [[Simon Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2005), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Their style was originally called "real punk" or [[street punk]]; ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' journalist [[Garry Bushell]] is credited with labelling the genre ''Oi!'' in 1980.

The Oi! movement was fueled by a sense that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of [[The Business (band)|the Business]] guitarist Steve Kent, "trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic&amp;nbsp;... and losing touch".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robb (2006), pp. 469–70.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bushell, "Punk was meant to be of the voice of [[the dole]] queue, and in reality most of them were not. But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology. In the places where [these bands] came from, it was harder and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music."&lt;ref&gt;Robb (2006), p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Lester Bangs described Oi! as "politicized football chants for unemployed louts".&lt;ref&gt;Bangs, Lester. "If Oi Were a Carpenter". ''Village Voice''. April 27, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; One song in particular, the Exploited's "Punks Not Dead", spoke to an international constituency.

Although most Oi! bands in the initial wave were apolitical or [[left wing]], many of them began to attract a [[white power skinhead]] following. Racist skinheads sometimes disrupted Oi! concerts by shouting fascist slogans and starting fights, but some Oi! bands were reluctant to endorse criticism of their fans from what they perceived as the "middle-class establishment".&lt;ref name="tzvi"&gt;Fleischer, Tzvi.

Anarcho-punk developed alongside the Oi! and American hardcore movements. Inspired by [[Crass]], its [[Dial House, Essex|Dial House]] commune, and its independent [[Crass Records]] label, a scene developed around British bands such as [[Subhumans (British band)|Subhumans]], [[Flux of Pink Indians]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Poison Girls]], and [[The Apostles (band)|the Apostles]] that was as concerned  with anarchist and DIY principles as it was with music. The acts featured ranting vocals, discordant instrumental sounds, primitive production values, and lyrics filled with political and social content, often addressing issues such as class inequalities and military violence.&lt;ref name=G170&gt;Gosling (2004), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-punk disdained the older punk scene from which theirs had evolved. In historian Tim Gosling's description, they saw "safety pins and Mohicans as little more than ineffectual fashion posturing stimulated by the mainstream media and industry. ... Whereas the Sex Pistols would proudly display bad manners and opportunism in their dealings with 'the establishment,' the anarcho-punks kept clear of 'the establishment' altogether".&lt;ref&gt;Gosling (2004), pp. 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement spun off several subgenres of a similar political bent. [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], founded back in 1977, established [[D-beat]] in the early 1980s. Other groups in the movement, led by [[Amebix]] and [[Antisect]], developed the extreme style known as [[crust punk]]. Several of these bands rooted in anarcho-punk such as [[the Varukers]], Discharge, and Amebix, along with former Oi! groups such as [[the Exploited]] and bands from farther afield like Birmingham's [[Charged GBH]], became the leading figures in the [[UK 82]] hardcore movement. The anarcho-punk scene also spawned bands such as [[Napalm Death]], [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], and [[Extreme Noise Terror]] that in the mid-1980s defined [[grindcore]], incorporating extremely fast tempos and [[death metal]]–style guitarwork.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell (2003), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Dead Kennedys, a U.S. anarcho-punk scene developed around such bands as Austin's [[MDC (band)|MDC]] and Southern California's Another Destructive System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sosrecords.us/label/taxonomy/term/1 |title=News Items|website=SOS Records|date=March 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218223342/http://sosrecords.us/label/taxonomy/term/1 |archive-date=December 18, 2007}} [http://www.animamundi.org/links.html Links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227185258/http://www.animamundi.org/links.html |date=February 27, 2005 }} Anima Mundi.

The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as [[Blink-182]] is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, "It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures."&lt;ref&gt;Di Bella, Christine.

From 1977 on, punk rock crossed lines with many other [[popular music]] genres.

The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector.&lt;ref&gt;Laing (1985), pp. 118, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1980s, British bands like [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, [[subculture|subcultural]] identity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodlad and Bibby (2007), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called "[[college rock]]".&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad (2001), passim; for relationship of Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, see pp. 205–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' declared that "Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the [[Grateful Dead]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdav.com/zinestuff/rs452.html Goldberg, Michael, "Punk Lives"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506143545/http://www.thirdav.com/zinestuff/rs452.html |date=May 6, 2008 }}, ''Rolling Stone'', July 18 – August 1, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as [[alternative rock]]. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including [[indie rock]], [[gothic rock]], [[dream pop]], [[shoegazing|shoegaze]], and [[grunge]], among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.&lt;ref name=Erlewine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/23/showbiz/music/nirvana-nevermind/index.html|title=American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|website=Allmusic|date=September 23, 2011|access-date=2011-11-07|archive-date=November 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102005827/http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/23/showbiz/music/nirvana-nevermind/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the queercore movement developed around a number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as [[God Is My Co-Pilot (band)|God Is My Co-Pilot]], [[Pansy Division]], [[Team Dresch]], and [[Sister George]]. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as [[Jayne County]], [[Phranc]], and [[Randy Turner]], and bands like [[Nervous Gender]], [[the Screamers]], and [[Coil (band)|Coil]], queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, [[sexual identity]], [[gender identity]], and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as [[Queeruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (2005), pp. 279–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a concert of female-led bands at the [[International Pop Underground Convention]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], heralded the emerging riot grrrl phenomenon.

Late 1970s punk music was anti-conformity and anti-mainstream, and achieved limited commercial success. By the 1990s, punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as "rebels". Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile, the [[Subaru Impreza]], claimed that the car was "like punk rock".&lt;ref&gt;Klein (2000), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, California's [[Green Day]] and [[Bad Religion]] were both signed to major labels.

Retrieved on September 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other California punk bands on the independent label [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]], run by Bad Religion guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]], also began achieving mainstream popularity. In 1994, Epitaph released ''[[Let's Go (Rancid album)|Let's Go]]'' by [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], ''[[Punk in Drublic]]'' by [[NOFX]], and ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' by [[the Offspring]], each eventually certified gold or better. That June, Green Day's "[[Longview (song)|Longview]]" reached number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and became a top forty airplay hit, arguably the first ever American punk song to do so; just one month later, the Offspring's "[[Come Out and Play (The Offspring song)|Come Out and Play]]" followed suit.

Other new North American pop punk bands, though often critically dismissed, also achieved major sales in the first decade of the 2000s. Ontario's [[Sum 41]] reached the Canadian top ten with its 2001 debut album, ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', which eventually went platinum in the United States. The record included the number one U.S. Alternative hit "[[Fat Lip]]", which incorporated verses of what one critic called "brat rap."&lt;ref&gt;Sinagra (2004), p. 791.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere around the world, "[[psychobilly|punkabilly]]" band [[the Living End]] became major stars in Australia with their [[The Living End (The Living End album)|self-titled 1998 debut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aiese, Eric|date=February 27, 2001|title=Living End 'Rolls On' with Aussie Punkabilly Sound|work=Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80523/living-end-rolls-on-with-aussie-punkabilly-sound|access-date=February 1, 2011|archive-date=May 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523183637/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80523/living-end-rolls-on-with-aussie-punkabilly-sound|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of commercialization on the music became an increasingly contentious issue. As observed by scholar Ross Haenfler, many punk fans "'despise corporate punk rock', typified by bandsSum&amp;nbsp;41 and Blink&amp;nbsp;182".&lt;ref&gt;Haenfler (2006), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
