'''Lynyrd Skynyrd''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|n|ər|d|_|ˈ|s|k|ɪ|n|ər|d}} {{respell|LEN|ərd|_|SKIN|ərd}})&lt;ref&gt;Pronunciation from album ''[[(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. The group originally formed as My Backyard in 1964 and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (lead vocalist), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass guitar) and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums).  The band spent five years touring small venues under various names and with several lineup changes before deciding on "Lynyrd Skynyrd" in 1969. The band released [[(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)|its first album]] in 1973, having settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns left and was replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]] in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by [[Steve Gaines]] in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" and "[[Free Bird]]". After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band's career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when [[Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash|their chartered airplane crashed]], killing Van Zant, Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]], and seriously injuring the rest of the band.

Lynyrd Skynyrd reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother [[Johnny Van Zant]] as lead vocalist. They continue to tour and record with co-founder Rossington (the band's sole continuous member), Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996. In January 2018, Lynyrd Skynyrd announced [[The Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour|its farewell tour]],&lt;ref name="Stone80"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lynyrd-skynyrd-plot-farewell-tour-w515880 |title= Lynyrd Skynyrd Plot Farewell Tour |website= RollingStone.com |date= January 25, 2018 |access-date= January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continue touring as of October 2019. Members are also working on their fifteenth album.&lt;ref name="ultimateclassicrock.com"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Martin |last=Kielty |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/lynyrd-skynyrd-new-album-2019/ |title = Lynyrd Skynyrd working on new album |date=March 19, 2019 |website=Ultimateclassicrock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked Lynyrd Skynyrd No.&amp;nbsp;95 on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".&lt;ref name=FirstFifty&gt;"The Immortals: The First Fifty".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Originals&gt;"The Original Lynyrd Skynyrd Band".&lt;/ref&gt; Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/byyear/2006?name=&amp;field_inductee_induction_year=2006-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_induction_category=All |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Inductees by Year: 2006 |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=August 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824065806/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/byyear/2006?name=&amp;field_inductee_induction_year=2006-01-01+00%3A00%3A00&amp;field_induction_category=All |archive-date=August 24, 2018 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the band has sold more than 28 million records in the United States.

==History==
===Early years (1964–1973)===
[[File:RobertELeeHSJacksonvilleFlorida.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonard Skinner]] was a physical education instructor at [[Robert E. Lee High School (Jacksonville)|Robert E. Lee High School]] (pictured) in Jacksonville, Florida known for his strict enforcement of the school's regulations on male hair length.]]

In [[Jacksonville, Florida]], during the summer of 1964, [[Ronnie Van Zant]], [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]], and [[Gary Rossington]] became acquainted while playing on rival baseball teams. The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[the Rolling Stones]]' then-current hit "[[Time Is on My Side]]". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. They soon approached guitarist [[Allen Collins]] to join the band, though Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway. Collins was soon convinced that Van Zant meant him no harm and he agreed to join the fledgling band.&lt;ref name="kijak-documentary"&gt;If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd, Passion Pictures, Directed by Stephen Kijak, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist [[Larry Junstrom]] soon rounded out the lineup and the band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to The Noble Five&lt;ref name=Name_Changes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com/less2.html |title= History Lessons |publisher= Lynyrd Skynyrd History site (Lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com) |access-date=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming The One Percent by 1968.&lt;ref name=Name_Changes/&gt;

Still known as The One Percent in 1969, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had "1% talent". At Burns' suggestion,&lt;ref name="kijak-documentary" /&gt; the group settled on ''Leonard Skinnerd'', which was in part a reference to a character named "Leonard Skinner" in [[Allan Sherman]]'s novelty song "[[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp)|Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Joseph |first =Hudak |title =Lynyrd Skynyrd’s New ‘If I Leave Here Tomorrow’ Doc: 10 Things We Learned |magazine =Rolling Stone |date =30 May 2018 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/lynyrd-skynyrds-new-if-i-leave-here-tomorrow-doc-10-things-we-learned-630575/ |access-date =18 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part a mocking tribute to [[physical education|P.E.]] teacher [[Leonard Skinner]] at [[Robert E.

Lee High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Soergel |first=Matt |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/01/26/met_509196.shtml |title=Honoring a namesake |work=Augusta Chronicle |access-date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair.&lt;ref name=RELee&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080524030503/http://www.dreamsbeginhere.org/lee/history.html Robert E.

Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the [[Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lynyrdskynyrddixie.com/2006/06/02/skynyrd-namesake-in-brevard/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625193759/http://lynyrdskynyrddixie.com/2006/06/02/skynyrd-namesake-in-brevard/|title=Skynyrd Namesake in Brevard |publisher=Lynyrd Skynyrd Dixie|archive-date=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner also allowed the band to use a photo of his Leonard Skinner Realty sign for the inside of their third album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leonard Skinner, Rock Band Muse, Dies at 77 |date= September 21, 2010 |access-date= September 22, 2010 |work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/arts/music/21skinner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts. Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in [[Macon, Georgia]]-based Hustlers Inc. with [[Phil Walden]]'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden]], became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively "southern" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit| title=Oxford Music Online| website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At that time, [[Rickey Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather [[Shorty Medlocke]] was an influence in the writing of "[[The Ballad of Curtis Loew]]". Some versions of the band's history state Burns briefly left the band during this time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVv-M4Sd46kC&amp;q=bob+burns+suddenly+left+the+band&amp;pg=PT52|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Remembering the Free Birds of Southern Rock| first1=Gene| last1=Odom| first2=Frank| last2=Dorman| date=October 8, 2002| publisher=Crown/Archetype| via=Google Books| isbn=9780767910286}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other versions state that Burns played with the band continuously through 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/arts/music/robert-burns-jr-first-lynyrd-skynyrd-drummer-dies-at-64.html|title=Robert Burns Jr., First Lynyrd Skynyrd Drummer, Dies at 64|first=Ashley|last=Southall|date=April 4, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak (1973–1977)===
In 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer [[Al Kooper]] of [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]], who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta.  Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions, playing on only two tracks.  He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part that Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in "[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album.  After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album ''[[(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)]]'' on August 13, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |access-date=September 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227083914/http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |archive-date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 1330] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured the hit song "[[Free Bird]]", which received national airplay,&lt;ref name="Butler, J. Michael 2014"&gt;Butler, J. Michael. "Lynyrd Skynyrd". Grove Music Online. N.p., September 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually reaching No.&amp;nbsp;19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|edition= 6th|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynyrd Skynyrd's fan base continued to grow rapidly throughout 1973, largely due to their opening slot on [[the Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' tour in the United States. Their 1974 follow-up album, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough.  Its single "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s "[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]", reached #8 on the charts that August. (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song "[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]" for the band, but they never recorded it.)&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but "Sweet Home Alabama" was the only single to crack the top ten.&lt;ref name="Butler, J. Michael 2014"/&gt;

By 1975, personal issues began to take their toll on the band. In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour&lt;ref name="kijak-documentary" /&gt; and was replaced by Kentucky native and former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Artimus Pyle]]. The band's third album, ''[[Nuthin' Fancy]]'', was recorded in 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Dennis |title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 15, 1975|id={{ProQuest|157771298}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording,&lt;ref name="kijak-documentary" /&gt; Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement after the tracking was completed, with Kooper mixing the album while the band left for the tour that had precipitated the constricted recording schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kooper |first1=Al |title=Backstage Passes &amp; Backstabbing Bastards |date=2008 |publisher=Backbeat Books/Hal Leonard Corp. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-87930-922-0 |pages=193-195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. Van Zant and King's guitar roadie were arrested the night prior and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings that broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to Los Angeles, believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.&lt;ref name="kijak-documentary" /&gt;

[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]

Collins and Rossington both had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition "[[That Smell]]" – a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the "Prince Charming" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.&lt;ref name="kijak-documentary" /&gt;

[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1977]]
The ''[[Street Survivors]]'' album of 1977 turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would "all be in his shadow one day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd – L.A. Times|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/lynyrd-sknyrd-l-a-times/|website=The Uncool - The Official Site for Everything Cameron Crowe|access-date=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaines' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written "You Got That Right" and the rousing guitar boogie "I Know a Little", which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy "Ain't No Good Life" – the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles "[[What's Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What's Your Name]]" and "That Smell". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, with shows always highlighted by the iconic rock anthem "Free Bird".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lynyrd-skynyrd |title=Freebird |publisher=Wolfgangsvault.com |access-date=September 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231906/http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lynyrd-skynyrd/ |archive-date=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plane crash (1977)===
{{Main|1977 Mississippi CV-240 crash}}

Following a performance at the [[Greenville Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], on October 20, 1977, the band boarded a chartered [[Convair CV-240 family#Variants|Convair CV-240]] bound for [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], where they were scheduled to appear at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] the following night.  After running out of fuel the pilots attempted an emergency landing before crashing in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of [[Gillsburg, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19771020-1&amp;lang=en |title=Accident Report, N55VM (10/20/77) |publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |access-date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR78-06.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report L and J Company, Convair 240, N55, Gillsburg, Mississippi, October 20, 1977 |publisher= libraryonline.erau.edu |date= June 19, 1978 |access-date= March 25, 2014 |work=U.S. National Transportation Safety Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, along with backup singer Cassie Gaines (Steve's older sister), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray were killed on impact. Other band members (Collins, Rossington, Wilkeson, Powell, Pyle, and Hawkins), tour manager Ron Eckerman, and several road crew members suffered serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Eckerman [http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/168499 Turn It Up!]. Smashwords.com. Retrieved on December 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident came just three days after the release of ''[[Street Survivors]]''. Following the crash and the ensuing press, ''Street Survivors'' became the band's second platinum album and reached No.&amp;nbsp;5 on the U.S. album chart. The single "What's Your Name" reached No.&amp;nbsp;13 on the single charts in 1978.  The original cover sleeve for ''Street Survivors'' had featured a photograph of the band amid flames, with Steve Gaines nearly obscured by fire. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with the album's back photo, a similar image of the band against a simple black background.&lt;ref name=Check-Six&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'Lynyrd Skynyrd' Crash |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |work=Check-Six.com |date=May 2007 |access-date=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group would restore the original image for the 30th anniversary deluxe edition of the album.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting only on one occasion to perform an instrumental version of "Free Bird" at [[Charlie Daniels]]' [[Volunteer Jam]] V in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Hiatus (1977–1987)===
Former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]]. During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed the Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes [[JoJo Billingsley]] and [[Leslie Hawkins]] and released one MCA album, titled ''A.P.B.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennesseeconcerts.com/Skynyrd.html |title=Exclusive Lynyrd Skynyrd Plane Crash Pictures |last=Adams| first=Pat |website= tennesseeconcerts.com |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Allen Collins's wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while [[Miscarriage|miscarrying]] their third child. He formed the [[Allen Collins Band]] in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington Collins Band and released one MCA studio album, ''Here, There &amp; Back''. He was visibly suffering from Kathy's death; he excessively drank and consumed drugs. On January 29, 1986, Collins, then 33, crashed his [[Ford Thunderbird]] into a ditch near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend Debra Jean Watts and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Woman-Killed-Rock-Musician-Injured-In-One-Car-Accident/id-60be797135c45eefa4c334ecc2679ca7 |title=Woman Killed, Rock Musician Injured In One-Car Accident| publisher=Associated Press| date=January 30, 1986| access-date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ult"/&gt;

===Return (1987–1995)===
In 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform&lt;ref name="Ult"&gt;Giles, Jeff. [https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allen-collins-car-accident/ "The Day Lynyrd Skynyrd Guitarist Allen Collins Was Paralyzed in a Car Accident"]. Ultimate Classic Rock, January 29, 2016. Retrieved June 23, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; (usually before the performance of "[[That Smell]]", the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him){{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} Collins was stricken with [[pneumonia]] in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, aged 37.&lt;ref name="Ult"/&gt;

The reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album ''[[Southern by the Grace of God]]: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987''. That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not "exploit" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness|newspaper=[[Florida Trend]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule, the band would have been forced to retire in 2001, but they have still continued to tour for another two decades.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

The band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled ''[[The Last Rebel]]'' in 1993.  Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

===Member changes and deaths (1996–2019)===
Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant. In his absence, he was replaced by [[Hughie Thomasson]]. The band did not let King rejoin after he recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NXdfW9kpokC&amp;pg=PA142|title=SPIN|first=SPIN Media|last=LLC|date=April 1, 1999|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by [[Rickey Medlocke]], who had previously played and recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s. The result was a major retooling of the band's 'guitar army'.  Medlocke and Thomasson would also become major contributors to the band's songwriting along with Rossington and Van Zant.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The first album with this new lineup, released in 1997, was entitled [[Twenty (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|''Twenty'']]. The band released another album, ''[[Edge of Forever]]'' in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]]. [[Michael Cartellone]] became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour.  Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The band released a Christmas album, entitled ''[[Christmas Time Again]]'' in 2000. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].&lt;ref name=Evans_death/&gt;

The first album to feature Evans was [[Vicious Cycle (album)|''Vicious Cycle'']], released in 2003.  This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song "Red, White and Blue".  The band also released a double collection album called ''[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]'', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, the album ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

[[File:Lynyrd 2008 (1).jpg|thumb|right|The band in 2008]]

[[Mark Matejka|Mark "Sparky" Matejka]], formerly of the country music band [[Hot Apple Pie]], joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson's replacement. On November 2, 2007, the band performed for a crowd of 50,000 people at the University of Florida's [[Gator Growl]] student-run [[pep rally]] in [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] ("The Swamp" football stadium). This was the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had played to in the U.S., until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people attended.&lt;ref name=Kirkland_Bama_Jam&gt;Kirkland, Kay.

On January 28, 2009, keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] died of a suspected heart attack at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. No autopsy was carried out. He was replaced by [[Peter Keys]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultimateclassicrock.com/lynyrd-skynyrd-pianist-billy-powell-dies/ "The Day Lynyrd Skynyrd Pianist Billy Powell Died"], ''Ultimate Classic Rock'', January 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud &amp; Proud Records, and released their new album ''[[God &amp; Guns]]'' on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the U.S. in 2009 with Keys on keyboards and [[Robert Kearns (musician)|Robert Kearns]] of [[the Bottle Rockets]] on bass; bassist Ean Evans died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009.&lt;ref name=Evans_death&gt;Kaufman, Gil.

In addition to the tour, Skynyrd appeared at the [[Sean Hannity]] [[Sean Hannity#FreedomConcerts|Freedom Concert]] series in late 2010. Hannity had been actively promoting the ''God &amp; Guns'' album, frequently playing portions of the track "That Ain't My America" on his radio show. The tour is titled "Rebels and Bandoleros". The band continued to tour throughout 2011, playing alongside [[ZZ Top]] and [[the Doobie Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/news/lynyrd-skynyrd-zz-top-join-forces-on-tour|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top join forces on tour|date=March 25, 2011|website=Goldmine|access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
