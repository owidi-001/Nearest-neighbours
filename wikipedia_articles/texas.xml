'''Texas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|k|s|ə|s}}, {{IPAc-en|also|local|ˈ|t|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|z}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Accents of English|551|hide1=y|hide2=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a state in the [[South Central United States|South Central]] region of the [[United States]]. It is the second largest [[U.S. state]] by both [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|area]] (after [[Alaska]]) and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|population]] (after [[California]]). Texas shares borders with the states of [[Louisiana]] to the east, [[Arkansas]] to the northeast, [[Oklahoma]] to the north, [[New Mexico]] to the west, and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|states]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]] to the south and southwest, and has a coastline with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the southeast.

[[Houston]] is the [[List of cities in Texas by population|most populous city]] in Texas and the [[List of United States cities by population|fourth largest]] in the U.S., while [[San Antonio]] is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]] and [[Greater Houston]] are the fourth and fifth largest [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|metropolitan statistical areas]] in the country, respectively. Other major cities include [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the second-most populous [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] in the U.S., and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. Texas is nicknamed the "'''Lone Star State'''" for its former status as an [[Republic of Texas|independent republic]], and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|Mexico]]. The "Lone Star" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.netstate.com/states/intro/tx_intro.htm |title=Introduction to Texas |publisher=Netstate.com |access-date=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of Texas's name is from the [[Caddo language|Caddo word]] {{lang|cad|táyshaʼ}} meaning 'friends'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanson-Harding |first=Alexandra |title=Texas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUemv3wa0O8C&amp;pg=PP1 |publisher=Children's Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-516-22322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its size and geologic features such as the [[Balcones Fault]], Texas contains diverse [[Geography of Texas|landscapes]] common to both the U.S. [[Southern United States|Southern]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=Andrew |title=Water in Texas: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEHH7ovVVDgC&amp;pg=PA25 |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |year=2008 |page=25 |isbn=978-0-292-71809-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. [[List of North American deserts|southwestern deserts]], less than ten percent of Texas's land area is [[desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dingus |first=Anne |title=The dictionary of Texas misinformation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hESAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |publisher=Texas Monthly Press |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-87719-089-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the population centers are in areas of former [[prairie]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[piney woods|forests]], and the [[coastline]]. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal [[swamp]]s and [[piney woods]], to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the [[desert]] and mountains of the [[Big Bend (Texas)|Big Bend]].

The term "[[six flags over Texas]]"&lt;ref group=note&gt;As used by the large [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]]-based national and international amusement park operator [[Six Flags]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory. [[Spain]] was the [[Spanish Texas|first European country to claim and control the area]] of Texas. France held a [[French colonization of Texas|short-lived colony]]. Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming the [[Republic of Texas]]. In 1845, Texas joined the union as the 28th state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolutions |url=http://legisworks.org/sal/9/stats/STATUTE-9-Pg108a.pdf |url-status=dead |website=Twenty-ninth Congress |date=1845 |access-date=May 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525081934/http://legisworks.org/sal/9/stats/STATUTE-9-Pg108a.pdf |archive-date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state's [[Texas Annexation|annexation]] set off a chain of events that led to the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846. A [[Slave and free states|slave state]] before the [[American Civil War]], Texas declared its secession from the U.S. in early 1861, and officially joined the [[Confederate States of America]] on March{{nbsp}}2 of the same year. After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.

Historically, four major industries shaped the [[Texas economy]] prior to [[World War II]]: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramos |first1=Mary G. |last2=Reavis |first2=Dick J. |title=Texas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgCE8AHvYUQC&amp;pg=PA125 |publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications |year=2004 |page=125 |isbn=978-0-676-90502-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before and after the U.S. Civil War, the cattle industry—which Texas came to dominate—was a major economic driver for the state, and created the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century, cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major [[petroleum]] deposits ([[Spindletop]] in particular) that initiated an [[Texas oil boom|economic boom]] which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. Texas developed a diversified economy and [[high tech]] industry during the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second in the United States of most [[Fortune 500]] company headquarters with 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hackett |first=Robert |title=States with the most Fortune 500 companies |url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/15/states-most-fortune-500-companies/ |work=Fortune |publisher=Time Inc. |date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including [[tourism]], agriculture, [[petrochemicals]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Computer industry|computers]] and [[Consumer electronics|electronics]], [[aerospace]], and [[biomedical sciences]]. Texas has led the U.S. in state export revenue since 2002, and has the [[List of U.S. states by GDP|second-highest]] [[Gross State Product|gross state product]]. If Texas were a [[sovereign state]], it would have the 10th-largest economy in the world.

===Pre-European era===
{{Texas History}}
{{further|Pre-Columbian Mexico}}

Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of [[Pre-Columbian North America]]: the [[Southwestern tribes|Southwestern]] and the [[Plains Indians|Plains]] areas. [[Archaeologists]] have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:{{sfn|Richardson|Wintz|Boswell|Anderson|2021|p=9}} the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] from the upper [[Rio Grande]] region, centered west of Texas; the [[Mississippian culture]], also known as [[Mound Builders]], which extended along the [[Mississippi River Valley]] east of Texas; and the civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], centered south of Texas. Influence of [[Teotihuacan]] in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries.

When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, several different cultures of Native peoples, divided into many smaller tribes, were living there. They were [[Caddo]]an, [[Atakapa]]n, Athabaskan, [[Coahuiltecan]], and Uto-Aztecan. The Uto-Aztecan Puebloan peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mostly centered along the Gulf Coast. At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the [[Aranama people|Aranama]], lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct. It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally. By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century. It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

No culture was dominant in the present-day Texas region, and many peoples inhabited the area.{{sfn|Richardson|Wintz|Boswell|Anderson|2021|p=10}} Native American tribes who lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apache]], Atakapan, [[Bidai]], Caddo, Aranama, [[Comanche]], [[Choctaw]], [[Coushatta]], [[Hasinai]], [[Jumano people|Jumano]], [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Kiowa]], [[Tonkawa]], and [[Wichita people|Wichita]].{{sfn|Richardson|Wintz|Boswell|Anderson|2021|p=12}}&lt;ref name="HoT bzi04"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|title=Indians|first=George |last=Klos|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Early indian west.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Early Native American tribal territories]]
The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution. They were not particularly kind to their native populations—even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French. When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance. The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it, the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. They included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Glover, William B. "A History of the Caddo Indians". Reprinted from 'The Louisiana Historical Quarterly'; Vol. 18, No. 4. October 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, John R. Indians of the Southeastern United States (Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1946) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a Native American tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of European explorers and [[settler]]s in that land.&lt;ref name=Richardson2005/&gt; Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt [[game (food)|wild game]]. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.&lt;ref name=Richardson2005&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rupert N. |last1=Richardson |first2=Adrian |last2=Anderson |first3=Cary D. |last3=Wintz |first4=Ernest |last4=Wallace |title=Texas: the Lone Star State |edition=9th |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-1318-3550-4 |pages=10–16|year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Texas Revolution, the U.S. became heavily involved. Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread. The Caddoans were always clueless when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense. It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties—preferably on the side of the Spanish. While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

By the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution of other native peoples, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas. Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements. This began the movement of Native populations north into what would become Indian Territory—modern-day Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are tied at the top, and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have, of which they have many, and they load them with the tents and poles and other things, for the country is so level, as I said, that they can make use of these, because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground.

European powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685. Miscalculations by [[René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] resulted in his establishing the colony of [[French colonization of Texas|Fort Saint Louis]] at [[Matagorda Bay]] rather than along the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=149}} The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.{{Sfnp|Chipman|1992|p=83}}

Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area.

When the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] from France in 1803, American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas. The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] in 1819, at what is now the border between Texas and Louisiana.{{sfnp|Weber|1992|pp=291–299}} Eager for new land, many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement.

Hoping more settlers would reduce the near-constant Comanche raids, [[Mexican Texas]] liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=164}} Under the Mexican immigration system, large swathes of land were allotted to ''[[empresario]]s'', who recruited settlers from the United States, Europe, and the Mexican interior. The first grant, to [[Moses Austin]], was passed to his son [[Stephen F. Austin]] after his death.

Austin's settlers, the [[Old Three Hundred]], made places along the [[Brazos River]] in 1822.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=198}} Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority of whom were from the United States.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|pp=198–199}} The population of Texas grew rapidly.

While Texas had won its independence, political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic. The nationalist faction, led by [[Mirabeau B.

The population of the new state was quite small at first, and there was a strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers who dominated in the state's eastern/northeastern portions and the Spanish-speaking former Mexicans ([[Tejanos]]) who dominated in the state's southern and western portions. Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of [[Texas Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]] that roamed the state. Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous.

After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States. While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the [[Nueces River]] leaving the [[Rio Grande Valley (Texas)|Rio Grande Valley]] under contested Texan sovereignty.&lt;ref name="TAnnexation" /&gt; While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so. President Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the [[Thornton Affair]] starting the [[Mexican–American War]]. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the [[Siege of Fort Texas]], [[Battle of Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]]. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas.&lt;ref name="Mwar"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=qdm02|title=Mexican War|first= K.

After a series of United States victories, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] ended the two-year war. In return, for US$18,250,000, Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, ceded the [[Mexican Cession]] in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were established at the Rio Grande.&lt;ref name="Mwar" /&gt;

The [[Compromise of 1850]] set Texas's boundaries at their present form. U.S. Senator [[James Pearce]] of Maryland drafted the final proposal where Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref name="comp1850" /&gt; a third of [[Colorado]], and small portions of [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Wyoming]] to the federal government, in return for the assumption of $10 million of the old republic's debt.&lt;ref name="comp1850"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=nbc02|title=Compromise of 1850|first=Roger A. |last=Griffin|orig-year=June 12, 2010 |date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.&lt;ref name="CCulture"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=afc03|title=Cotton Culture|first1=Karen Gerhardt |last1=Britton |first2=Fred C. |last2=Elliott |first3=E.

===Civil War to late 19th century===
{{main|Ordinance of Secession|Confederate States of America|Texas in the American Civil War}}
Texas was at war again after the [[1860 United States presidential election|election of 1860]]. At this time, blacks comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved.&lt;ref name=HOT&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |id=pkaan |first=W. Marvin |last=Dulaney |title=African Americans |orig-year=June 9, 2010 |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union. Five other [[Deep South|Deep South states]] quickly followed. A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861. On February 1, by a vote of 166–8, the convention adopted an [[Ordinance of Secession]] from the United States. Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861. Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861 ratifying the permanent [[Constitution of the Confederate States|C.S. Constitution]] on March 23.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SecessionConvention"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=mjs01|title=Secession Convention|first=Walter L. |last=Buenger|orig-year=June 15, 2010 |date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Texans favored secession initially, although many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] was the state Governor, [[Sam Houston]]. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor.&lt;ref name="SamHoustonHB"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |id=fho73| name=Houston, Samuel |first=Thomas H. |last=Kreneck |orig-year=June 15, 2010 |date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While far from the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|major battlefields]] of the [[American Civil War]], Texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the Confederacy.&lt;ref name="CivilwarHB"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |id=qdc02 |title=Civil War |first=Ralph A. |last=Wooster |orig-year=June 12, 2010 |date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union troops briefly [[First Battle of Galveston|occupied]] the state's primary port, Galveston. Texas's border with Mexico was known as the "backdoor of the Confederacy" because trade occurred at the border, bypassing the Union blockade.&lt;ref name="FederalWriter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Federal Writers' Project |title=Texas, A Guide to the Lone Star State: Brownsville |publisher=Native American Books Distributor |date=December 1997 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUI26u0B_VEC&amp;pg=PA206 |isbn=978-0-403-02192-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route,&lt;ref name="CivilwarHB" /&gt; but Texas's role as a supply state was marginalized in mid-1863 after the Union capture of the [[Mississippi River]].

Like most of the South, the Texas economy was devastated by the War. However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, war tensions, or other problems. Indeed, "Gone to Texas" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=Gwen|title=Between the Creeks|url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth752794/m2/1/high_res_d/Between%20_the_Creeks_by_Gwen_Pettit_compiled_by_Melinda_Fisher.pdf|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=texashistory.unt.edu|quote=The Southern states, especially the hills of Tennessee and Alabama, were impoverished; war tensions still split neighborhoods. Soon, empty houses had crude signs that stated that the former inhabitants had “Gone to Texas.” Church records, also, had the phrase, “Gone to Texas” by numerous names on their roles. So many families left Maury County, Tenn., to settle in eastern Collin County, just across East Fork, that several communities, such as Culleoka, have names directly from south Maury County. That group joined relatives that had come here in the 1850s. Most new immigrants had some link to Collin County, which brought them here. They stayed with relatives and friends until they could find a place to settle. Landowners recruited farmers from the old states by persuading relatives and former neighbors to come. However, numerous families, in the pioneer tradition, loaded their children and belongings in a wagon and headed toward the unknown west. Clarksville, Bonham and Dallas newspapers reported how many wagons passed through each day and how many were camped on the “jockey yards” waiting to find a place to settle. Some of these had sold farms and had money to buy land, but most of these immigrants became tenant farmers and worked on shares.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas and the rest of the U.S. (and the rest of the world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly expanded in Texas and was its largest industry before the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TSHA {{!}} Lumber Industry|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/lumber-industry|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=www.tshaonline.org|quote=But relatively, the industry's status is far below its dominant position at the beginning of the twentieth century. Then it was the state's largest manufacturing enterprise, first among Texas industries in generating income, and the largest employer of labor in the Lone Star State.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early to mid-20th century===
[[File:Lucas_gusher.jpg|thumb|231x231px|Spindletop, the first major oil gusher]]
In 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston hurricane]].&lt;ref name="deadhurr" /&gt; On January 10, 1901, the first major [[oil well]] in Texas, [[Spindletop]], was found south of [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]].

In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] for voting, which effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites and [[Latinos]]. In addition, the legislature established [[white primaries]], ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=791091 |title=Nixon v. Condon.

Senator Robert La Follette filled many a speech with praise for progressives in other countries who shared his hatred for militarism. Henry Ford chartered an ocean liner to transport himself and dozens of other activists across the Atlantic, where they lobbied neutral governments to embrace a peace plan they would press on the warring powers. These Americans, like most critics of the war elsewhere in the world, wanted to create a new global order based on cooperative relationships between nation states and their gradual disarmament. Militarism, they argued, isolated peoples behind walls of mutual fear and loathing. Until April 1917, this formidable coalition of idealists—or realists—did much to keep the nation at peace. They may even have had a majority of Americans on their side until just weeks before Congress, at Wilson’s behest, voted to declare war. To prevent that from happening, peace activists pressed for a national referendum on the question, confident that “the people” would recoil from fighting and paying the bills in order to help one group of European powers conquer another.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] dealt a double blow to the state's economy, which had significantly improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst-hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, blacks left Texas in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation.&lt;ref name=HOT/&gt; In 1940, Texas was 74% [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Anglo]], 14.4% black, and 11.5% Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jillson|first=Cal|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-82941-7|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=James Ward|last2=Barnes|first2=Carolyn N.|last3=Bowman|first3=Kent Adam|title=1941: Texas Goes to War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwBnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1991|publisher=University of North Texas Press|isbn=978-0-929398-29-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairchild|first=Louis|title=They Called It the War Effort: Oral Histories from World War II Orange, Texas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syZDE5pBzjoC&amp;pg=PP1|edition=second|year=2012|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-0-87611-259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peck|first1=Merton J.|author-link1=Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|last2=Scherer|first2=Frederic M.|author-link2=Frederic M.

Texas modernized and expanded its [[Education in Texas#Public colleges and universities|system of higher education]] through the 1960s.

Texas is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|second-largest]] U.S. state, after [[Alaska]], with an area of {{convert|268820|sqmi|km2}}. Though 10% [[List of countries by area|larger than France]], almost twice as large as [[Germany]] or [[Japan]], and more than twice the size of the [[United Kingdom]], it ranks only 27th worldwide amongst [[List of the largest country subdivisions by area|country subdivisions by size]]. If it were an independent country, Texas would be the [[List of countries by area|39th-largest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 31, 2017|title=How Big is Texas Compared to Countries Around the World?

Texas is in the [[South Central United States|south central]] part of the United States of America. Three of its borders are defined by rivers. The [[Rio Grande]] forms a natural border with the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]] to the south. The [[Red River of the South|Red River]] forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north. The [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]] forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. The [[Texas Panhandle]] has an eastern border with Oklahoma at [[100th meridian west|100° W]], a northern border with Oklahoma at [[Parallel 36°30' north|36°30' N]] and a western border with New Mexico at [[103rd meridian west|103° W]]. [[El Paso]] lies on the state's western tip at [[32nd parallel north|32° N]] and the Rio Grande.&lt;ref name="comp1850" /&gt;

With 10 [[Köppen climate classification|climatic regions]], 14 [[Agricultural soil science|soil regions]] and 11 distinct [[Ecoregion|ecological regions]], regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities.&lt;ref name="Tx eco regions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasep.org/html/lnd/lnd_1reg.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603175718/http://www.texasep.org/html/lnd/lnd_1reg.html |archive-date=June 3, 2008 |title=Tx Environmental Profiles |access-date=July 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: [[Gulf Coastal Plains]], Interior Lowlands, [[Great Plains]], and Basin and Range Province.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|date=October 4, 2019|title=Physical Regions of Texas {{!}} Texas Almanac|url=https://texasalmanac.com/topics/environment/physical-regions-texas|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=texasalmanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state. Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods. The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest. The [[Cross Timbers|Cross Timbers region]] and [[Caprock Escarpment]] are part of the Interior Lowlands.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Martin-Dies-Jr-State-Park.jpg|thumb|[[Steinhagen Reservoir]]]]

The Great Plains region in Central Texas spans through the state's [[Texas Panhandle|panhandle]] and [[Llano Estacado]] to the state's [[Texas Hill Country|hill country]] near Austin. This region is dominated by [[prairie]] and [[steppe]]. "Far West Texas" or the "[[Trans-Pecos]]" region is the state's Basin and Range Province. The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Ecoregions — Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department|url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/hunter-education/online-course/wildlife-conservation/texas-ecoregions|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=tpwd.texas.gov|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/habitats/rivers/ |title=Rivers in Texas |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=November 16, 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=Hal P. |last=Bybee |id=rnr07 |title=Rivers |date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Rio Grande]] as the largest. Other major rivers include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]], the [[Brazos River|Brazos]], [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado]], and [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. While Texas has few natural lakes, Texans have built more than a hundred [[List of lakes in Texas|artificial reservoirs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/fish/recreational/lakes/lakelist.phtml |title=Alphabetical List of Texas Lakes |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=January 28, 2010 |access-date=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a [[List of regions of the United States|recognized region of the United States]]. Notable extremes range from [[East Texas]] which is often considered an extension of the [[Deep South]], to [[Trans-Pecos|Far West Texas]] which is generally acknowledged to be part of the [[Southwestern United States|interior Southwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/is-texas-southern-western-or-truly-a-lone-star/ |website=[[Texas Monthly]] |title=Is Texas Southern, Western, or Truly a Lone Star? |last=Nova Lomax |first=John |date=March 3, 2015 |access-date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] of Mexico. The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geology|url=https://www.nhnct.org/geology/geo1.html|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=www.nhnct.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] uplift, [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]], and the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], near El Paso. [[Sedimentary rocks]] overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or [[passive margin]] that developed during [[Cambrian]] time.

This margin existed until [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] collided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod to form [[Pangea]]. This is the buried crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]–[[Ouachita Mountains]] zone of Pennsylvanian [[continental collision]]. This [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest is today buried beneath the Dallas–[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]–Austin–San Antonio trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2016|title=Late Cretaceous and Tertiary Burial History, Central Texas|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56e481e827d4bdfdac7fbe0f/t/58c1e3fac534a59cc49605f6/1489101856226/Rose%2C+P.%2C+2016%2C+Late+Cretaceous+and+Tertiary+Burial+History%2C+Central+Texas%2C+GCAGS.pdf|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=www.gcags.org|quote=Fault displacement decreases steadily to the north of Austin and to the west of San Antonio; Balcones faulting dies out about halfway between Waco and Dallas, and about halfway between Uvalde and Del Rio.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late [[Paleozoic]] mountains collapsed as [[rifting]] in the [[Jurassic]] period began to open the Gulf of Mexico. Pangea began to break up in the [[Triassic]], but [[seafloor spreading]] to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and [[late Jurassic]]. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form. Today {{convert|9|to|12|mi|km|0|}} of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US [[oil reserves]] are here. At the start of its formation, the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick [[evaporite]] deposits of Jurassic age. These salt deposits formed [[salt dome]] [[diapir]]s, and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast.&lt;ref name="DiaperGrowth"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Muzzafar |first=Asif |title=Timing of Diapir Growth and Cap Rock Formation, Davis Hill Salt Dome, Coastal Texas |url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001AM/finalprogram/abstract_24852.htm |conference=GSA Annual Meeting, November 5–8, 2001 |publisher=The Geological Society of America |access-date=July 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907164932/http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001AM/finalprogram/abstract_24852.htm |archive-date=September 7, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Texas outcrops consist of [[Cretaceous]] and [[Paleogene]] sediments which contain important deposits of [[Eocene]] [[lignite]]. The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]] contain oil. [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala Aquifer|Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Ogallala"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npwd.org/new_page_2.htm |title=Ogallala Aquifer |access-date=July 23, 2008 |publisher=North Plains Groundwater Conservation District |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704071707/http://www.npwd.org/new_page_2.htm |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary, Texas has no [[volcanoes]] and few earthquakes.&lt;ref name="earthquakes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/compendium/earthquakes.htm |title=Earthquakes |access-date=July 23, 2008 |publisher=Jackson School of Geosciences—University of Texas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501011850/http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/compendium/earthquakes.htm |archive-date=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] gives the state highly variable weather. The [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]] of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns.

Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas, once or twice a year in North Texas, and once every few years in Central and East Texas. Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances. Of note is the [[2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm]], when {{convert|6|in|mm}} of snow fell as far south as [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]], where the average high temperature in December is 65&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KNQI/2008/12/24/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA |title=History: Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date=December 24, 2008 |access-date=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], followed by [[1886 Indianola hurricane|another hurricane]] in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events allowed [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] to take over as the chief port city. The [[1900 Galveston hurricane]] subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000.

County government runs similar to a "weak" [[mayor-council]] system; the county judge has no veto authority, but votes along with the other commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Texas County Government|url=https://co.jefferson.tx.us/prct1/TAC_brochure.pdf|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=co.jefferson.tx.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas county judge|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_county_judge|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=Ballotpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Texas permits cities and counties to enter "interlocal agreements" to share services, the state does not allow [[consolidated city-county]] governments, nor does it have [[metropolitan government]]s. Counties are not granted [[home rule]] status; their powers are strictly defined by state law. The state does not have townships—areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a municipality. The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas. Municipalities are classified either "general law" cities or "home rule".&lt;ref name="homerule"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=McDonald |first=John V. |title=An Analysis of Texas' Municipal Home Rule Charters Since 1994" |date=August 2000 |publisher=Texas State University |url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/124/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5,000 population with voter approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Rule {{!}} City of Center - Texas|url=https://centertexas.org/city-council/home-rule|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=centertexas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas also permits the creation of "special districts", which provide limited services. The most common is the [[school district]], but can also include hospital districts, community college districts, and utility districts (one utility district near Austin was the plaintiff in [[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder|a landmark Supreme Court case involving the Voting Rights Act]]). Municipal, school district, and special district elections are [[nonpartisan]],&lt;ref name="reqvote"&gt;{{cite web|title=Run for Party Nomination to Public Office |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/4_6_2.html |access-date=October 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318023922/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/4_6_2.html |archive-date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the party affiliation of a candidate may be well-known.

Texas's population density as of 2010 is 96.3 people per square mile (34.9/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) which is slightly higher than the average [[List of countries by population density|population density]] of the U.S. as a whole, at 87.4 people per square mile (31.1/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, while Texas and France are similarly sized geographically, the European country has a population density of 301.8 people per square mile (116.5/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[File:Mission San Antonio aka Alamo.jpg|thumb|[[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] is one of the most recognized symbols of Texas.|left]]

Historically, Texas culture comes from a blend of Southern [[Southern United States|(Dixie)]], Western (frontier), and Southwestern [[Southwestern United States|(Mexican/Anglo fusion)]] influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas is placed in the [[Southern United States]] by the [[United States Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name=regdiv&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |title=Census Regions and Divisions of the United States |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular food item, the [[breakfast burrito]], draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a [[melting pot]] of cultures from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=October 5, 1982|title=A California-style migration stirs up Texas melting pot|work=Christian Science Monitor|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/1005/100528.html|access-date=December 28, 2020|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 24, 2017|title=Can Houston move past the 'melting pot'?|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Can-Houston-move-past-the-melting-pot-12377720.php|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=HoustonChronicle.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas has made a strong mark on national and international pop culture. The entire state is strongly associated with the image of the [[cowboy]] shown in [[westerns]] and in [[country western music]]. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|''Dallas'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dallas|date=April 2, 1978|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077000/|type=Drama, Romance|others=Larry Hagman, Ken Kercheval, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray|publisher=Lorimar Productions, Lorimar Telepictures, Lorimar Television|access-date=December 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Richard|title=40 years on from the TV series, Dallas is much more than oil barons and big hats|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/texas/articles/tv-series-dallas-attractions/|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railroads===
{{See also|List of Texas railroads}}Part of the state's [[Cowboy#Texas tradition|tradition]] of cowboys is derived from the massive [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to [[Cattle drives in the United States|drive]] livestock to railroads and markets in Kansas, for shipment to the east. Towns along the way, such as [[Baxter Springs, Kansas|Baxter Springs]], the first cow town in Kansas, developed to handle the seasonal workers and tens of thousands of head of cattle being driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cowtowns - Kansapedia - Kansas Historical Society|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/cowtowns/15598|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=www.kshs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first railroad to operate in Texas was the [[Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway]], opening in August 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=George C. |last=Werner |id=eqb16 |title=Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway |date=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first railroad to enter Texas from the north, completed in 1872, was the {{nowrap|[[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=Donovan L. |last=Hofsommer |id=eqm08 |title=Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad |date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing railroad access, the ranchers did not have to take their livestock up to the Midwest and shipped beef out from Texas.

[[Amtrak]] provides Texas with limited intercity passenger rail service. Three scheduled routes serve the state: the daily ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' {{nowrap|(Chicago–San Antonio)}}; the tri-weekly ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' {{nowrap|(New Orleans–Los Angeles)}}, with stops in Texas; and the daily ''[[Heartland Flyer]]'' {{nowrap|(Fort Worth–Oklahoma City)}}. Texas may get one of the nation's first [[high-speed rail]] line.

==Government and politics==
The current [[Texas Constitution]] was adopted in 1876. Like many [[State constitution (United States)|states]], it explicitly provides for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its [[United States Bill of Rights|federal counterpart]], and has provisions unique to Texas.&lt;ref name="BillofRights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights (Article 1) |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/7_4_2.html |access-date=October 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206142915/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/7_4_2.html |archive-date=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas has a plural [[executive branch]] system limiting the power of the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the [[Secretary of State of Texas|secretary of state]], voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor.&lt;ref name="pluralexec"&gt;{{cite web |year=2005 |title=The Plural Executive |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_9_0.html |access-date=May 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928082847/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_9_0.html |archive-date=September 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[George W. Bush]] served as Texas's governor, the state had a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lieutenant governor, [[Bob Bullock]]. The executive branch positions consist of the [[List of Governors of Texas|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|lieutenant governor]], comptroller of public accounts, land commissioner, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, the three-member [[Texas Railroad Commission]], the State Board of Education, and the secretary of state.&lt;ref name="pluralexec" /&gt;

The [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Texas Legislature]] consists of the [[Texas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], with 150 members, and a [[Texas Senate|Senate]], with 31 members. The [[Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] leads the House, and the lieutenant governor, the Senate.&lt;ref name="Legislature Members"&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=Membership |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/2_2_4.html |access-date=June 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302003227/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/2_2_4.html |archive-date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over a hundred days, but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably, the Legislature cannot call itself into session).&lt;ref name="Special Sessions"&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=Special Sessions |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/2_2_2.html |access-date=June 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302003217/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/2_2_2.html |archive-date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state's [[fiscal year]] begins September{{nbsp}}1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FY 2021 State Budget Status|url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/fy-2021-state-budget-status.aspx#:~:text=Forty-six%20states%20began%20fiscal,1.|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=www.ncsl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[judiciary of Texas]] is among the most complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the [[Texas Supreme Court]], for civil cases, and the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]]. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment.&lt;ref name="Judiciary"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=jzj01|title=Judiciary|first=Paul |last=Womack|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the ''[[Gregg v.

The [[Texas Ranger Division]] of the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] is a [[police|law enforcement agency]] with statewide [[jurisdiction]]. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as [[riot police]] and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and for the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by [[Stephen F. Austin]] in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history and some of the best-known criminal cases in the history of the [[American Old West|Old West]].&lt;ref name="TexasRangers"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=met04|title=Texas Rangers|first=Ben H. |last=Procter|orig-year=June 15, 2010 |date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. What are called commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have [[home-rule]] governments. The vast majority of these have charters for [[council-manager]] forms of government, by which voters elect council members, who hire a professional city manager as an operating officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council-manager government|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Council-manager_government|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=Ballotpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], followed by [[white primaries]]; these measures effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans.&lt;ref name="yale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu" /&gt; In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote.&lt;ref name="MOTTU"&gt;{{cite book|title=African-American Pioneers of Texas: From the Old West to the New Frontiers (Teacher's Manual) |publisher=Museum of Texas Tech University: Education Division |page=25 |url=https://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/a-a.%20teacher's%20manual.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205173917/http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/A-A.%20Teacher%27s%20Manual.pdf |archive-date=February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Democratic Party dominated [[Politics of Texas|Texas politics]] from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TSHA {{!}} Democratic Party|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/democratic-party|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=www.tshaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dixie's Long Journey From Democratic Stronghold To Republican Redoubt|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/25/417154906/dixies-long-journey-from-democratic-stronghold-to-republican-redoubt|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Texas was essentially a one-party state during this time and the Democratic primary was viewed as "the real election", the Democratic Party had conservative and liberal factions, which became more pronounced after the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name="PoliticalPartiesTSHA"&gt;{{cite Handbook of Texas |title=Political Parties |id=wap02 |date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several factions of the party briefly split during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="PoliticalPartiesTSHA" /&gt;

The state's conservative white voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for local and state offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members.&lt;ref name="SouthWon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Risen |first=Clay |date=March 5, 2006 |title=How the South was won |work=The Boston Globe |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/ |access-date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed to the fact the Democratic Party became increasingly [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXvoters"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Texas Voters |url=http://www.newschannel10.com/story/33661247/history-of-texas-voters |date=November 8, 2016 |website=NewsChannel10 |publisher=[[KFDA-TV]] |access-date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Texas was always a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXvoters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PBSredstate"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Texas Became a "Red" State |website=Frontline |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/architect/texas/realignment.html |date=April 12, 2005 |publisher=[[PBS]] |access-date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant [[Karl Rove]], who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="PBSredstate" /&gt; Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the [[Sun Belt]] that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.&lt;ref name="HoT npt02" /&gt;

Career attorneys and analysts at the Department of Justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of African American and Hispanic voters, but political appointees overrode them and approved it.&lt;ref name="NYTGerry" /&gt; Legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the case ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v.

Since 1980, most Texas voters have supported Republican presidential candidates. In 2000 and 2004, Republican [[George W. Bush]] won Texas with respectively 59.3 and 60.1 percent of the vote, partly due to his "favorite son" status as a former governor of the state. [[John McCain]] won the state in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], but with a smaller margin of victory compared to Bush at 55 percent of the vote. Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio consistently lean Democratic in both local and statewide elections.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The state's changing demographics may result in a change in its overall political alignment, as a majority population of Black and Hispanic/Latino voters support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report focusing on the political persuasion of Hispanic and Latino voters. |publisher=CNN |access-date=May 30, 2012 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/30/politics/latino-vote-sleeping-giant/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of counties along the [[Rio Grande]] closer to the [[Mexico–United States border]], where there are many Latino residents, generally vote for Democratic Party candidates, while most other rural and suburban areas of Texas have shifted to voting for Republican Party candidates.&lt;ref name="2000electionresults"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2000&amp;fips=48&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0 |title=2000 Presidential General Election Results—Texas |website=US Election Atlas |access-date=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2004electionresults"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=48&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0 |title=2004 Presidential General Election Results—Texas |website=uselectionatlas.org |access-date=July 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
