As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, he is the most recent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor of California.

Schwarzenegger began [[weight training|lifting weights]] at the age of 15 and went on to win the [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title at age 20, subsequently winning the [[Mr. Olympia]] contest seven times; he remains a prominent figure in bodybuilding, and has written many books and articles on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lift-heavy-to-build-muscle-like-arnold-schwarzenegger.html|title=Lift Heavy To Build Muscle Like Arnold Schwarzenegger|author=Gentilcore, Tony|publisher=Powerlifting.com|date=March 2, 2018|access-date=May 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715093657/https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lift-heavy-to-build-muscle-like-arnold-schwarzenegger.html|archive-date=July 15, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arnold Sports Festival]], considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muscleinsider.com/features/50-years-mr-olympia|title=50 years of the Mr Olympia {{!}} MUSCLE INSIDER|website=muscleinsider.com|access-date=January 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006114723/https://muscleinsider.com/features/50-years-mr-olympia|archive-date=October 6, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film star. Having previously appeared in the bodybuilding documentary ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977), his breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), a box-office hit that resulted in [[Conan the Destroyer|a sequel]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="katzfilm" /&gt; He then appeared as the [[Terminator (character)|title character]] in the critically and commercially successful sci-fi film ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), and subsequently played similar characters in the sequels ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003), ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015), and ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'' (2019). He also starred in other successful action films such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), and ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), in addition to comedy films such as ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' (1994), and ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'' (1996), and one mixed action/thriller-based comedy, ''[[Red Heat (1988 film)|Red Heat]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/red-heat-1988|title=Red Heat movie review &amp; film summary (1988)|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=June 17, 1988|last=Ebert|first=Roger|access-date=March 2, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Keslassy|first1=Elsa|date=October 14, 2019|title=Alibaba's Youku Boards 'Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten' With Arnold Schwarzenegger|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/global/alibaba-youku-stan-lees-superhero-kindergarten-arnold-schwarzenegger-mipcom-1203368897/|access-date=October 19, 2020|website=Variety|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in [[2003 California gubernatorial recall election|a special recall election]] to replace then-Governor [[Gray Davis]]. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] runner-up [[Cruz Bustamante]]. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was re-elected in the [[2006 California gubernatorial election]] with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a full term as governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501386.html |title=Schwarzenegger Sworn in for Second Term |agency=Associated Press |access-date=April 23, 2008 |last=Kurtzman |first=Laura |work=The Washington Post |date=January 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104192701/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501386.html |archive-date=November 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he reached his [[term limit]] as Governor and returned to his career in acting.

Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy" during his acting career,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4779796/arnold-schwarzenegger-university-of-houston-uh-commencement-graduation/|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger at University of Houston Commencement: 'None of Us Can Make It Alone'|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 15, 2017|access-date=March 2, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator") during his political career. He married [[Maria Shriver]], the niece of President [[John F. Kennedy]], in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997, and their divorce was finalized in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-opens-up-about-cheating-on-maria-shriver/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: Cheating on Maria Shriver Was a 'Major Screw-up' |last=Marcus |first=Emily |date=November 2, 2017 |access-date=April 8, 2018 |journal=[[Us Weekly]] |issn=1529-7497 |editor-last=Peros |editor-first=Jennifer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141550/https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-opens-up-about-cheating-on-maria-shriver/ |archive-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's father was the local chief of police and had served in [[World War II]] as a ''[[Hauptfeldwebel]]'' after voluntarily joining the [[Nazi Party]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-aug-14-me-father14-story.html|title=Austrian Archives Reveal Nazi Military Role of Actor’s Father|date=August 14, 2003 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Tracy Wilkinson|last2=Matt Lait}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nazi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie: 'I was abused as child' |date=August 4, 2004 |url=http://news.scotsman.com/arnoldschwarzenegger/Arnie-I-was-abused-as.2551492.jp |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818225021/http://news.scotsman.com/arnoldschwarzenegger/Arnie-I-was-abused-as.2551492.jp |archive-date=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was wounded in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surprised by Russia: 5 things that charmed Arnold Schwarzenegger in Moscow |url=https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/327632-surprised-by-russia-schwarzenegger |work=Russia Beyond |date=February 20, 2018 |access-date=July 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718030522/https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/327632-surprised-by-russia-schwarzenegger |archive-date=July 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was discharged in 1943 following a bout of [[malaria]]. He married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. Later in his life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the Jewish activist group [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav being involved in war crimes during his service in the Nazi Party and [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA).&lt;ref name="governG2" /&gt; Gustav's background received wide press attention during the [[2003 California gubernatorial recall election]] in which Schwarzenegger was elected governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 24, 2003|title=Records: Arnold's father was member of Nazi storm troops|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2003-08-24-arnold-father_x.htm|url-status=live|access-date=August 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522170405/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2003-08-24-arnold-father_x.htm|archive-date=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: "Back then in Austria it was a very different world [...] if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, [[spare the rod and spoil the child|the rod was not spared]]."&lt;ref name="askarnold1" /&gt; He grew up in a Catholic family who attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] every Sunday.&lt;ref name="tmas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |title=True Myths of Arnold Schwarzenegger |year=2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-58234-465-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/truemythslifetim0000andr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Herman |title=Ah-nold in cross hairs Rivals blast Calif. front-runner |date=August 11, 2003 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/ah-nold-cross-hairs-rivals-blast-calif-front-runner-article-1.522414 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |access-date=August 20, 2012 |location=New York |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026214348/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/ah-nold-cross-hairs-rivals-blast-calif-front-runner-article-1.522414 |archive-date=October 26, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="riotvideo" /&gt; Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.&lt;ref name="governG2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Xan |last=Brooks |title=The Governator |date=August 8, 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/08/usa.politicsandthearts |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=April 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827055648/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/08/usa.politicsandthearts |archive-date=August 27, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; His favoritism was "strong and blatant", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.&lt;ref name="wl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leigh |first=Wendy |title=Arnold: An Unauthorized Biography |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-7207-1997-0 |publisher=Pelham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger has said that his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems".&lt;ref name="tmas" /&gt; He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: Mr. Olympia&amp;nbsp;– 1970–1975, 1980 |publisher=BodyBuild.com |url=http://www.bodybuildbid.com/articles/mrolympia/arnold-schwarzenegger.html |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421231324/http://www.bodybuildbid.com/articles/mrolympia/arnold-schwarzenegger.html |archive-date=April 21, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early education and bodybuilding beginnings ===
At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average but stood out for his "cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant" character.&lt;ref name="tmas"/&gt; Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.&lt;ref name="wl" /&gt; Schwarzenegger's father Gustav was an athlete, and wished for his sons to become a champion in [[Bavarian curling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-08-14|title=Austrian Archives Reveal Nazi Military Role of Actor's Father|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-aug-14-me-father14-story.html|access-date=2021-01-11|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by his father, Schwarzenegger played several sports as a boy.&lt;ref name="tmas"/&gt;

Schwarzenegger began [[weight training]] in 1960 when his [[Association football|football]] coach took his team to a local gym.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; At the age of 14, he chose [[bodybuilding]] over football as a career.&lt;ref name="katzfilm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-074214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="profilear"&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=August 31, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101220131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3131155.stm |archive-date=November 1, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said, "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic lifting]]."&lt;ref name="askarnold1" /&gt; However, his official website biography claims that "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career."&lt;ref name="mrever"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Everything |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416234020/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/athlete/mreverything/index.asp?sec=athlete&amp;subsec=mreverything |archive-date=April 16, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech in 2001, he said, "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was.

[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 1971.jpg|thumb|Schwarzenegger in 1971]]
Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in [[Graz]], where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as [[Reg Park]], [[Steve Reeves]], and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] on the big screen.&lt;ref name="askarnold1" /&gt; When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends in order to train even when it was closed. "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it." When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first cinema experience as a boy, he replied: "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some [[newsreels]]. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a [[John Wayne]] movie."&lt;ref name="askarnold1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ask Arnold |year=2000 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203926/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/askarnold/news_askarnold_eng_legacy_444.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=askarnold |archive-date=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Graz, Schwarzenegger was mentored by Alfred Gerstl, who had Jewish ancestry and later became [[List of presidents of the Federal Council (Austria)|president of the Federal Council]], and befriended his son Karl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tracy Wilkinson|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-sep-10-me-austria10-story.html |title=Schwarzenegger Is Still Their Hometown Hero |website=Los Angeles Times |date=September 10, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Seth Rogovoy |url=https://forward.com/culture/451703/on-his-73rd-birthday-arnold-schwarzeneggers-secret-jewish-history/ |title=On his 73rd birthday, Arnold Schwarzenegger's secret Jewish history |website=Forward |date=July 30, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; He was [[drunk driving|driving drunk]] and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named [[Patrick M. Knapp Schwarzenegger|Patrick]]. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S.&lt;ref name="wl"/&gt; Gustav died of a stroke on December 13, 1972.&lt;ref name="lifeline"/&gt; In ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''Pumping Iron&amp;nbsp;– 25th Anniversary Edition'' DVD extras&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.&lt;ref name="DT2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The girl who can't escape Arnie |date=October 6, 2003 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3603696/The-girl-who-cant-escape-Arnie.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=April 18, 2008 |first=Oliver |last=Poole |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410221914/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2003%2F10%2F02%2Fbfarni02.xml&amp;page=1 |archive-date=April 10, 2008 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.&lt;ref name="wl" /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what "would now be called [[child abuse]]" at the hands of his father: "My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'"&lt;ref name="nazi" /&gt;

Schwarzenegger served in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Austrian Army]] in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt; During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt; He went [[AWOL]] during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences." He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted "best-built man of Europe", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. "The [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich."&lt;ref name="per" /&gt; Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the [[Universe Championships#History|NABBA Mr. Universe]] competition in London.&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt; He placed second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner [[Chester Yorton]].&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt;

Charles "Wag" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in [[Forest Gate|Forest Gate, London]]. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the [[East End of London]] helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece |location=London |work=The Times |title=Wag Bennett bodybuilder who helped Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=October 2, 2008 |first=Lindsay |last=McIntosh |access-date=October 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525033754/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4862637.ece |archive-date=May 25, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis Arnold Schwarzenegger: Made in Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817080410/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/777625?view=synopsis |date=August 17, 2010 }}, [[British Film Institute]].

Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so,&lt;ref name="LAWarn"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Bradley |title=Mr. California |date=November 20, 2002 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2002-11-28/news/mr-california/ |work=LA Weekly |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816085006/http://www.laweekly.com/2002-11-28/news/mr-california/ |archive-date=August 16, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; realized his dream by moving to the United States in October 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English.&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; There he trained at [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Venice, Los Angeles]], California, under [[Joe Weider]]'s supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was [[Ric Drasin]], a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Randy (October 21, 2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20031225065902/http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/archives/2003/october/617.htm "Ric Drasin: Arnold's lifting partner!"] The Arnold Fans Website.

In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first [[Mr. Olympia]] title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt;

The immigration law firm Siskind &amp; Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an [[illegal immigrant]] at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his [[visa (document)|visa]].&lt;ref name="Possible Visa Violations"&gt;{{cite news |first=Siskind |last=Bland |title=Schwarzenegger May Have Violated Terms Of Non-Immigrant Visa |date=September 4, 2007 |url=http://www.visalaw.com/03sep4/15sep403.html |work=VISALAW.COM |access-date=April 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220094159/http://www.visalaw.com/03sep4/15sep403.html |archive-date=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[LA Weekly]]'' would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who "overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s".&lt;ref name="LAWarn" /&gt;

In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide ''Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder'' became a huge success.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; In 1977, he posed for the gay magazine ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger A name to be reckoned with |url=http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/ |website=Rotten.com |access-date=April 9, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219083706/http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/ |archive-date=December 19, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paslay |first1=Christopher |title=The Village Proposal: Education as a Shared Responsibility |date=September 1, 2011 |publisher=R&amp;L Education |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6rU59neX34C&amp;q=schwarzenegger+%22after+dark%22&amp;pg=PA146 |access-date=April 9, 2016|isbn=9781610480611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to taking an assortment of courses at [[Santa Monica College]] in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] as part of UCLA's extension program, Schwarzenegger had by then accumulated enough credits so as to be "within striking distance" of graduation. In 1979, he enrolled in the [[University of Wisconsin–Superior]] as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and received his [[bachelor's degree]] in business administration and marketing. He got his [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizenship]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/education/campus_connection/article_d8646d66-ce45-11de-ba14-001cc4c03286.html |work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]] |title=Campus Connection: Superior list of famous alumni? |date=November 11, 2009 |access-date=April 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907024535/http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/education/campus_connection/article_d8646d66-ce45-11de-ba14-001cc4c03286.html |archive-date=September 7, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger said that during this time he encountered a friend who told him he was teaching [[Transcendental Meditation]] (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal that he had been struggling with [[anxiety]] for the first time in his life: "Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.in/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-says-a-year-of-practicing-Transcendental-Meditation-in-the-70s-changed-his-life/articleshow/46125489.cms |work=Richard Feloni |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger says a year of practicing Transcendental Meditation in the '70s changed his life |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207083920/http://www.businessinsider.in/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-says-a-year-of-practicing-Transcendental-Meditation-in-the-70s-changed-his-life/articleshow/46125489.cms |archive-date=February 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and his legacy is commemorated in the [[Arnold Classic]] annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' and ''[[Flex (magazine)|Flex]]''. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1&amp;nbsp;million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a [[conflict of interest]] since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of [[dietary supplement]]s in California.&lt;ref name="megerian"&gt;Megerian, Chris. (March 1, 2013). [https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schwarzenegger-20130302,0,1141770.story "Schwarzenegger to be executive editor of magazines"]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302141955/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schwarzenegger-20130302,0,1141770.story |date=March 2, 2013 }} ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.&lt;ref name="megerian" /&gt; American Media Inc., which owns ''Muscle &amp; Fitness'' and ''Flex'', announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.&lt;ref name="megerian" /&gt;

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt; He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4&amp;nbsp;– [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [England], 1&amp;nbsp;– [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until [[Lee Haney]] won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 [[Arnold Classic]] he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc |title=Ask Arnold Training Seminar – Arnold Schwarzenegger Talks Bodybuilding Advice – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=March 6, 2011 |access-date=October 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220212802/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPEVHihgmHc |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powerlifting/weightlifting ===
During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several [[Olympic weightlifting]] and [[powerlifting]] contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Pro Bodybuilding Profile |url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/bodybuilders-arnold.html |website=Bodybuilding.com |language=en |date=October 11, 2015 |access-date=July 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705212606/https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/bodybuilders-arnold.html |archive-date=July 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.&lt;ref name="gmv.com.au" /&gt;

In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the [[Munich]] stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254&amp;nbsp;kg / 560&amp;nbsp;lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.

=== Mr. Olympia ===
Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming [[Mr. Olympia]].&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt; His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion [[Sergio Oliva]]. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt;

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions.&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt; He also toured different countries selling [[vitamin]]s, as in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 1972, when he lived at the [[YMCA]] Hotel Hospiz (nowadays Hotel Arthur&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hotelarthur.fi/en/hotel/history/ Hotel Arthur's history – Hotel Arthur]&lt;/ref&gt;) on Vuorikatu and presented vitamin pills at the [[Stockmann, Helsinki centre|Stockmann shopping center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwarzenegger |first=Arnold |year=2012 |title=Total Recall |location=New York |page=141 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-84983-971-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/kuvat-schwarzenegger-pullisteli-lihaksiaan-70-luvulla-helsingissa/4318554#gs.jxapzf KUVAT: Schwarzenegger pullisteli lihaksiaan 70-luvulla Helsingissä] (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt; beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.&lt;ref name="mrever" /&gt;

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete and film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. Although significantly taller and heavier, [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, "Why not compete?" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary "[[The Comeback (1980 film)|The Comeback]]") was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO0twE91JiA|title=Arnold's Worst Physique VS Arnold's Best Physique|last=Nick's Strength and Power|publisher=YouTube|access-date=January 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subpar conditioning shouldn't have allowed him to go ahead of a very competitive lineup that year;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Mike Mentzer]], in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getbig.com/results/e-mroly.htm|title=Mr. Olympia Contest Results|website=www.getbig.com|access-date=January 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605130530/http://www.getbig.com/results/e-mroly.htm|archive-date=June 5, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ironmanmagazine.com/the-1980-mr-olympia-controversy/|title=The 1980 Mr. Olympia Controversy |work=[[Iron Man Magazine]]|last=Hansen|first=John|language=en-US|access-date=January 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190131092902/https://www.ironmanmagazine.com/the-1980-mr-olympia-controversy/|archive-date=January 31, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steroid use ===
Schwarzenegger has acknowledged using [[Performance-enhancing substance|performance-enhancing]] [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when [[Weight cutting|cutting up]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conan the Politician |publisher=[[ESPN]] |url=http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |access-date=April 18, 2008 |last=Farrey |first=Tom |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329223151/http://espn.go.com/columns/farrey_tom/1655597.html |archive-date=March 29, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has called the drugs "tissue building".&lt;ref name="Arnold Steroids"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold &amp; Steroids: Truth Revealed |publisher=get2net |url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 8, 2003 |access-date=April 18, 2008 |last=Theunissen |first=Steve  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and [[#Accidents, injuries, and other health issues|later heart problems]]. Since the doctor never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 [[Defamation#Germany|libel]] judgment against him in a German court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Schwarzenegger Wins German Lawsuit |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |agency=United Press International |date=December 1, 1999 |access-date=December 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418105938/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-24150868.html |archive-date=April 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'', a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie settles $50m libel case |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |date=December 22, 1999 |access-date=December 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412023333/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/574902.stm |archive-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acting career ==
=== Early roles ===
Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the title role in ''[[Hercules in New York]]'' (1970). Credited under the stage name "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt; His second film appearance was as a [[deaf-mute]] mob hitman in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: "It was very difficult for me in the beginning&amp;nbsp;– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."&lt;ref name="askarnold1" /&gt;

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the [[bodybuilding]] film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977),&lt;ref name="katzfilm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt; elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Smoking Gun: Archive |publisher=TheSmokingGun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |access-date=May 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427071904/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/arnoldpump1.html |archive-date=April 27, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The San Pedro Beach Bums]]'' and the ABC [[police procedural]] ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]].

=== Action superstar ===
Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.&lt;ref name="katzfilm" /&gt; This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.&lt;ref name="tessay"&gt;{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=Empire Essay: The Terminator |url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |work=Empire |access-date=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, ''[[Rio Carnival|Carnival]] in Rio''. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in [[James Cameron]]'s science fiction [[thriller film]] ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name="katzfilm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fanleam" /&gt; Following this, Schwarzenegger made ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name="tessay" /&gt; During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and [[Sylvester Stallone]] becoming international stars.&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt; The two rivals attacked each other in the press, and tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons.{{r|pearson20171009}} Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat (1988 film)|Red Heat]]'' (1988).

[[File:Chth arnold schwarzenegger.jpg|thumb|Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], with his catchphrase "[[I'll be back]]" written in.]]
''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1990|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]". ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) reunited him with director [[Ivan Reitman]], who directed him in ''Twins''. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', entitled "[[List of Tales from the Crypt episodes#Season 2 (1990)|The Switch]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Buck |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger directs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19900422&amp;id=xdIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,1660751 |newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |agency=Associated Press |date=April 22, 1990 |access-date=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903182833/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19900422&amp;id=xdIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ms4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,1660751 |archive-date=September 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with the 1992 [[telemovie]] ''[[Christmas in Connecticut (1992 film)|Christmas in Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Endrst |title='Connecticut' could use more of Arnold's muscle |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19920412&amp;id=m1ZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6719,2774672 |newspaper=The Register-Guard |date=April 12, 1992 |access-date=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903182833/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19920412&amp;id=m1ZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oesDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6719,2774672 |archive-date=September 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the [[National Association of Theatre Owners]] named him the "International Star of the Decade".&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt; His next film project, the 1993 self-aware [[action comedy]] [[parody|spoof]] ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', was released opposite ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which went on to earn over $150&amp;nbsp;million domestically (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|150|2003|r=0|fmt=c}} million today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator3.htm |title=Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208093821/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator3.htm |archive-date=December 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.jpeg|thumb|Arnold Schwarzenegger's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame]]
In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall|-1|sp=us}} ''Terminator'' statue in a park in central [[Graz]]. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold wants 'Terminator' statue killed |publisher=Killoggs |url=http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |date=September 27, 2002 |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223210646/http://www.killoggs.com/news/?news=609 |archive-date=February 23, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retirement ===
His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in ''[[The Rundown]]'' and the 2004 remake of ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film ''[[The Kid &amp; I]]''. He voiced [[Baron von Steuben]] in the ''[[Liberty's Kids]]'' episode "[[Valley Forge]]". He had been rumored to be appearing in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php |title=Arnold downplays a Terminator Salvation cameo |publisher=SCI FI Wire |access-date=March 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313234133/http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/arnold-confirms-but-downp.php |archive-date=March 13, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first ''Terminator'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger (Virtually) Back in Terminator Salvation |work=TV Guide |access-date=May 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520083012/http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Terminator-1005894.aspx |archive-date=May 20, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg |title=McG Talks Terminator Salvation |publisher=reelzchannel.com |access-date=May 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190521/http://www.reelzchannel.com/person/176340/mcg |archive-date=May 1, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', where he made a [[cameo appearance]].

=== Return to acting ===
In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama ''With Wings as Eagles'', written by [[Randall Wallace]], based on a true story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krone.at/Welt/Schwarzenegger_Ich_lese_gerade_drei_Drehbuecher-Krone-Interview-Story-240860 |title=Schwarzenegger: "Ich lese gerade drei Drehbücher" – "Krone"-Interview – Welt |publisher=krone.at |date=January 16, 2011 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119035212/http://www.krone.at/Welt/Schwarzenegger_Ich_lese_gerade_drei_Drehbuecher-Krone-Interview-Story-240860 |archive-date=January 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1741.html |title=Arnold's Big Comeback Film May Soar with "Wings"!

=== ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' ===
In September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace [[Donald Trump]] as host of ''[[The New Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/09/14/media/arnold-schwarzenegger-apprentice-nbc/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger is the next host of NBC's 'Celebrity Apprentice' |author=Brian Stelter and Frank Pallotta |date=September 14, 2015 |work=CNNMoney |access-date=September 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916224406/https://money.cnn.com/2015/09/14/media/arnold-schwarzenegger-apprentice-nbc |archive-date=September 16, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This show, the 15th season of ''The Apprentice'', aired during the 2016–2017 TV season.

In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. He also reacted to Trump's remarks in January 2017 via Instagram: "Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs?

Schwarzenegger has been a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for many years. When he was an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning community. At the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |date=August 31, 2004 |title=Schwarzenegger: No country more welcoming than the USA |publisher=CNN |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408110102/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.schwarzenegger.transcript/ |archive-date=April 8, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential campaign]] was in full swing. I remember watching the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]–[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.

But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, "What party is he?" My friend said, "He's a Republican." I said, "Then I am a Republican." And I have been a Republican ever since.}}

In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in "[[Stop the Madness]]", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], accompanying then–Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] at a campaign rally.&lt;ref name="Noonan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=Peggy |author-link=Peggy Noonan |title=What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era |publisher=Random House |date=October 14, 2003 |location=New York |page=384 |isbn=978-0-8129-6989-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]], on which he served from 1990 to 1993.&lt;ref name="lifeline"/&gt; He was nominated by the now-President Bush, who dubbed him "[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Republican". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor [[Pete Wilson]].

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a [[Red Cross]] ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio [[public service announcement]]s to donate blood.

In an interview with ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside." ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for [[governor of California]]. Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, "I'm in show business&amp;nbsp;– I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold cast as Governor? |date=October 4, 1999 |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp?id=90 |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523203946/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/news.asp%3Fid%3D90 |archive-date=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Governor of California ===
{{Main|First term of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California|Second term of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of California}}
Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election]] for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003 episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.&lt;ref name="profilear" /&gt; Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to ''The Terminator'' movies, see above) and "[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.&lt;ref name="FirstDebate"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grey |first=Barry |title=First debate in California recall election: Snapshot of a political system in crisis |date=November 6, 2003 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml |publisher=wsws.org |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508191758/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/cali-s06.shtml |archive-date=May 8, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schwarzenegger Bush.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship.]]
On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor [[Gray Davis]] being removed from office with 55.4% of the ''Yes'' vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat [[Cruz Bustamante]], fellow Republican [[Tom McClintock]], and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million votes. Under the regulations of the [[California Constitution]], no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor [[John G. Downey]] in 1862.

Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up [[Gridlock (politics)|political gridlock]]. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch "[[Hans and Franz]]" from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians "[[girlie men]]".&lt;ref name="SFGirlieMen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger deems opponents 'girlie-men' |date=July 18, 2004 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/18/MNGH57NKAF1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=April 18, 2008 |first=Peter |last=Nicholas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504060359/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F07%2F18%2FMNGH57NKAF1.DTL |archive-date=May 4, 2008 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a [[California special election, 2005|special election]] he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160&amp;nbsp;million dollars to defeat you". The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in ''[[Knox v.

Schwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat [[Phil Angelides]], the [[California State Treasurer]], in the [[2006 California gubernatorial election|2006 elections]], held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Election&amp;nbsp;– Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State |url=http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219111658/http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm |archive-date=February 19, 2007 |access-date=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum.

Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and [[bodybuilding]] as the means to escape a depressing home.&lt;ref name="governG2" /&gt; Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential&amp;nbsp;– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people."&lt;ref name="governG2" /&gt; Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and [[Sargent Shriver]] became my heroes."&lt;ref name="LAWarn" /&gt; Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of [[John F.

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican primary]] of the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]] was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Senator [[John McCain]], Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, "It's Rudy's fault!" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Baltimore Sun |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html |title=Arnold opens 'flood' of McCain endorsements |access-date=May 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307072727/http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/01/arnold_opens_flood_of_mccain_e.html |archive-date=March 7, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug use and allegations of sexual misconduct ===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger sexual harassment protestors750.jpg|thumb|[[Code Pink]] protesting against Schwarzenegger]]
During his [[2003 California gubernatorial recall election|initial campaign for governor in 2003]], allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref name="grope1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex scandal draws Arnie apology |date=March 10, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3159122.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218154557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3159122.stm |archive-date=December 18, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' recounting decades old allegations of sexual misconduct from six individual women.&lt;ref name="behaving badly"&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger sorry for behaving 'badly' toward women |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html |date=October 3, 2003 |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408110108/http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/recall.schwarzenegger/index.html |archive-date=April 8, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grope1" /&gt; Schwarzenegger responded to the allegations in 2004 admitting that he has "behaved badly sometimes" and apologized, but also stated that "a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/03/usa.filmnews|title= Schwarzenegger admits behaving badly after groping claims|website= The Guardian|access-date= January 11, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the women who came forward was British television personality [[Anna Richardson]], who settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger; his top aide, Sean Walsh; and his publicist, Sheryl Main.&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwarzenegger libel 'settled' |date=August 26, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/5288194.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909074501/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/5288194.stm |archive-date=September 9, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement read: "The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled."&lt;ref name="AR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AR2"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK judge allows Arnie libel case |date=March 23, 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4375679.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821025435/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4375679.stm |archive-date=August 21, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time a 1977 interview in adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' gained attention, in which Schwarzenegger discussed using substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwarzenegger's Sex Talk |publisher=The Smoking Gun |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/schwarzeneggers-sex-talk |access-date=July 23, 2012 |date=May 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704170517/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/schwarzeneggers-sex-talk |archive-date=July 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in 1975 in the documentary film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' (1977). In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, "[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me."&lt;ref name="Cannabis"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/29/local/me-arnold29 |title=Governor says marijuana is not a drug, 'it's a leaf' |date=October 29, 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=October 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220144632/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/29/local/me-arnold29 |archive-date=December 20, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.&lt;ref name="Cannabis" /&gt;

=== Citizenship ===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2004-01-30.jpg|thumb|right|Schwarzenegger in 2004]]
Schwarzenegger became a [[naturalized U.S. citizen]] on September 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[United Press International]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/us/actor-becomes-us-citizen.html |title=Actor Becomes U.S. Citizen |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 1983 |access-date=January 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122051700/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/us/actor-becomes-us-citizen.html |archive-date=January 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his [[Austrian citizenship]], as Austria does not usually allow [[dual citizenship]]. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the [[Austrian Parliament]] from the [[Austrian Green Party]], unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of [[Donald Beardslee]] and [[Stanley Williams]]. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: "A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic."&lt;ref name="DamageAustria" /&gt; Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency if such an error had occurred.

=== Environmental record ===
On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]], creating the nation's first cap on [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |access-date=May 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |title=Schwarzenegger Signs Global Warming Bill |first=Samantha |last=Young |date=September 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105054329/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700174.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]]. They plan to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html |access-date=May 15, 2008 |publisher=Fox News Channel |title=Cal Joins Northeast Global Warming Fight |first=Karen |last=Matthews |date=October 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525191041/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct17/0,4670,GlobalWarmingSchwarzenegger,00.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his [[Hummer H1|Hummers]] to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/04/02/8403410/index.htm "The Governator's green agenda"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106005149/https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/04/02/8403410/index.htm |date=November 6, 2013 }} ''Fortune''.

In respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] World Congress in Detroit on April 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sae.org/servlets/pressRoom?OBJECT_TYPE=PressReleases&amp;PAGE=showRelease&amp;RELEASE_ID=970 "SAE 2009 World Congress Special Opening Ceremonies to Feature Gov.

=== Presidential ambitions ===
The [[Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment]] in 2003 was widely accredited as the "Amend for Arnold" bill, which would have added an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run, as he was not a [[natural born citizen]]. In 2004, the "Amend for Arnold" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Amend-for-Arnold-campaign-launched-Web-site-2635267.php "'Amend for Arnold' campaign launched / Web site, TV spot promote change to Constitution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525192620/http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Amend-for-Arnold-campaign-launched-Web-site-2635267.php |date=May 25, 2017 }}, John Wildermuth.

In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine with [[Michael Bloomberg]], and subsequently, the two joked about a presidential ticket together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/06/19/bloomberg-schwarzenegger-ponder-presidential-ticket/ "Bloomberg, Schwarzenegger ponder presidential ticket"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075312/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/06/19/bloomberg-schwarzenegger-ponder-presidential-ticket/ |date=February 11, 2017 }}, CNN.

In October 2013, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for president. The former California governor would have faced a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] hurdle; [[Natural-born-citizen clause|Article II, Section I, Clause V]] prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. At the time he had reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional change]], or filing a legal challenge to the provision. [[Columbia University]] law professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, "The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold lobbies for White House run |author=Smith, E. |url=http://pagesix.com/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-mounting-legal-challenge-to-run-for-president/ |newspaper=New York Post |date=October 18, 2013 |access-date=October 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018192106/http://pagesix.com/2013/10/18/schwarzenegger-mounting-legal-challenge-to-run-for-president/ |archive-date=October 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==
Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.&lt;ref name="governG2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAWarn"/&gt; Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a "prolific goal setter" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car&amp;nbsp;– and succeed in doing so.&lt;ref name="DT2"/&gt; By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of lucrative business ventures and investments.

=== Bricklaying business ===
In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Millionaire Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Real Life Action Hero |work=Millionaire Magazine |url=http://www.millionaire.com/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212192915/http://www.millionaire.com/interviews_schwarzenegger.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 2004 |access-date=April 18, 2008 |last=Morgan |first=Kaya  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Working" Out |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp?sec=life&amp;subsec=didyouknow |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523204758/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/life/didyouknow/life_didyouknow_eng_legacy_257.asp%3Fsec%3Dlife%26subsec%3Ddidyouknow |archive-date=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail-order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.&lt;ref name="lifeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Millionaire Magazine" /&gt;

=== Investments ===
Schwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000.

In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in [[Santa Monica]] called Schatzi On Main. ''Schatzi'' literally means "little treasure," and colloquially "honey" or "darling" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights is in the wrong in its junk fax lawsuit where it falsely blames Arnold Schwarzenegger for faxes sent to promote a restaurant he doesn't own |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_16.asp?sec=news&amp;subsec=uptotheminute |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523204836/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/news/uptotheminute/news_uptotheminute_eng_legacy_16.asp%3Fsec%3Dnews%26subsec%3Duptotheminute |archive-date=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
=== Early relationships ===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver-mod.jpg|thumb|right|Schwarzenegger with then-wife [[Maria Shriver]] at the 2007 [[Special Olympics]] in Shanghai]]
In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974.&lt;ref name="arniememoir"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnie's ex-girlfriend pens memoir |date=September 9, 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3092740.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422031941/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/3092740.stm |archive-date=April 22, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, "Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life."&lt;ref name="arniememoir" /&gt; Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a "joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became "insufferable—classically conceited—the world revolved around him".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor's old flame says he's a great guy |date=September 15, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/15/MN272943.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=April 19, 2007 |first=Lance |last=Williams |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526031215/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2003%2F09%2F15%2FMN272943.DTL |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled ''Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak''.&lt;ref name="bakes"&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Elsworth |title=Arnie puts his weight behind ex-lover's tell-all memoir |date=September 14, 2006 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1528857/Arnie-puts-his-weight-behind-ex-lover%27s-tell-all-memoir.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610113917/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1528857/Arnie-puts-his-weight-behind-ex-lover%27s-tell-all-memoir.html |archive-date=June 10, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the [[tell-all|tell-all book]] with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.&lt;ref name="bakes" /&gt;

Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.&lt;ref name="bakes" /&gt; Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.&lt;ref name="bakes" /&gt; The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the [[Apollo 11|first Apollo Moon landing]] on television.&lt;ref name="DT2" /&gt; They shared an apartment in [[Santa Monica, California]] for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.&lt;ref name="DT2" /&gt; Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had "little understanding of polite society" and she found him a turn-off, she says, "He's as much a [[self-made man]] as it's possible to be—he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me."&lt;ref name="DT2" /&gt;

Schwarzenegger met his next lover, [[Beverly Hills]] hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on [[Venice Beach]] in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an [[open relationship]]: "We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted."&lt;ref name="wl" /&gt; Schwarzenegger met television journalist [[Maria Shriver]], niece of President [[John F. Kennedy]], at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978 when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.&lt;ref name="wl" /&gt;

=== Marriage and family ===
On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]].

=== Vehicles ===
Growing up during the [[Allied occupation of Austria]], Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: My army tank mistake |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyw6mJhb090 |website=YouTube |language=en |access-date=May 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626192439/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyw6mJhb090 |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he paid $20,000 to bring his Austrian Army [[M47 Patton]] tank (331) to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/arnold-schwarzenegger-gives-kids-rides-in-his-old-war-tank.html|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger paid $20,000 to ship his old tank to the US and now uses it to help kids|website=cnbc.com|date=July 26, 2018|access-date=October 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821234116/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/arnold-schwarzenegger-gives-kids-rides-in-his-old-war-tank.html|archive-date=August 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965.

Moreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a [[Humvee]]. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, [[AM General]], to produce a [[street-legal vehicle|street-legal]], civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two [[Hummer H1]]s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for [[hydrogen]], one for [[vegetable oil]], and one for [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hummer and Schwarzenegger: They probably won't be back |date=February 28, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022603248.html |access-date=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102212601/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022603248.html |archive-date=November 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare [[Bugatti Veyron]] Grand Sport Vitesse.

The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large—each weighs {{convert|6300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide—that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the [[California Hydrogen Highway]] Network, and gained a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thanks to Arnold, California, to Pave the Hydrogen Highway |publisher=BMW World |url=http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |access-date=April 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051803/http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/hydrogen/schwarzenegger.htm |archive-date=March 16, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUMMER H2H Hydrogen Powered Experimental Vehicle |publisher=About.com |url=http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |access-date=April 18, 2008 |last=Wickell |first=Dale |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525024014/http://trucks.about.com/od/hybridcar/a/hummer_h2h.htm |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy ===
In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the [[USC Price School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schwarzenegger.com/issues/post/usc-schwarzenegger-institute-for-state-and-global-policy |title=USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy &amp;#124; Politics &amp; Issues – Arnold Schwarzenegger |publisher=Schwarzenegger.com |access-date=January 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122051826/http://www.schwarzenegger.com/issues/post/usc-schwarzenegger-institute-for-state-and-global-policy |archive-date=January 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute's mission is to "[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve" and to "seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/about-the-institute/mission |title=About the Institute &amp;#124; USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy |publisher=Schwarzenegger.usc.edu |access-date=January 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122053351/http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/about-the-institute/mission |archive-date=January 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the institute.&lt;ref name="schwarzenegger.usc.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/about-the-institute/about-the-institute-leadership |title=Leadership &amp;#124; USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy |publisher=Schwarzenegger.usc.edu |access-date=January 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122053059/http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/about-the-institute/about-the-institute-leadership |archive-date=January 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global warming ===
At a 2015 security conference, Schwarzenegger called [[global warming|climate change]] the issue of our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/schwarzenegger-climate-change-the-issue-our-time |title=Schwarzenegger: Climate change is 'the issue of our time' |year=2015 |publisher=MSNBC |access-date=February 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203180454/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/schwarzenegger-climate-change-the-issue-our-time |archive-date=February 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also urged politicians to stop treating climate change as a political issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/schwarzenegger-on-climate-change-2015-12|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger: Republicans need to stop treating climate change like a political issue|website=Business Insider|date=December 9, 2015|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026151428/https://www.businessinsider.com/schwarzenegger-on-climate-change-2015-12|archive-date=October 26, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 presidential election ===
For the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican Party presidential primaries]], Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican [[John Kasich presidential campaign, 2016|John Kasich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_calls_Kasich_The_Terminator |title=Schwarzenegger calls Kasich the 'Terminator' |work=New Hampshire Union Leader |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215071504/http://www.unionleader.com/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_calls_Kasich_The_Terminator%26source%3DRSS |archive-date=February 15, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|that year's United States presidential election]], with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://people.com/politics/arnold-schwarzenegger-will-not-be-voting-for-donald-trump-choose-your-country-over-your-party/ |title=Arnold Schwartzenegger Will Not Be Voting For Donald Trump |date=October 8, 2016 |newspaper=PEOPLE.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009104158/http://people.com/politics/arnold-schwarzenegger-will-not-be-voting-for-donald-trump-choose-your-country-over-your-party/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-09/robert-de-niro-says-he-would-like-to-punch-trump/7916292 |title='I want to punch him': De Niro launches scathing attack on Trump |date=October 9, 2016 |newspaper=ABC News |language=en-AU |access-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009083618/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-09/robert-de-niro-says-he-would-like-to-punch-trump/7916292 |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-john-mccain-wont-vote-for-donald-trump-w444040 |title=Schwarzenegger, McCain, More Drop Support of Trump |newspaper=Us Weekly |access-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009104008/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-john-mccain-wont-vote-for-donald-trump-w444040 |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-2016 ===
[[File:California Governors - Your Action Saves Lives campaign video.ogg|thumb|Schwarzenegger participating in a video promoting wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The video features appearances of all the living governors of California.]]
In recent years, Schwarzenegger has been advocating for eating less meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Schwarzenegger, Arnold|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkWRe_9WQE|date=July 18, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2019|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger on Going Vegan|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702225759/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkWRe_9WQE|archive-date=July 2, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is an executive producer alongside [[James Cameron]] et al. behind the documentary ''[[The Game Changers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gamechangersmovie.com |title=The Game Changers |access-date=July 10, 2019 |language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004181842/https://gamechangersmovie.com/ |archive-date=October 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; that documents the explosive rise of [[plant-based]] eating in professional sports, in which he is also featured.

In 2017, Schwarzenegger condemned [[white supremacists]] who were seen carrying Nazi and Confederate flags by calling their heroes "losers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-trump-the-united-states-no-place-for-nazi-flags-2017-8|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger to white supremacists: 'Your heroes are losers'|website=Business Insider|date=August 18, 2017|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026142949/https://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-trump-the-united-states-no-place-for-nazi-flags-2017-8|archive-date=October 26, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, while at the "Arnold Classic Africa" sports competition as an official, Schwarzenegger was attacked by an assailant in a flying kick. The assailant was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48322307|title=No charges over attack, says Schwarzenegger|date=May 19, 2019|access-date=May 29, 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518183702/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48322307|archive-date=May 18, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the January 6 [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol]] by supporters of President [[Donald Trump]], Schwarzenegger posted a video address on social media in which he likened the insurrection to [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Kristallnacht]], which he described as "a night of rampage against the Jews carried out [by] the Nazi equivalent of the [[Proud Boys]]". He spoke of [[Gustav Schwarzenegger|his father]]'s alcoholism, domestic violence and abuse, and how it was typical of other former Nazis and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborators]] in the post-war era, and described Trump as "a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst president ever."&lt;ref name=riotvideo&gt;{{Cite tweet|last=Schwarzenegger|first=Arnold|user=Schwarzenegger  |number=1348249481284874240|date=10 January 2021 |title=(Video) My message to my fellow Americans and friends around the world following this week's attack on the Capitol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Schwarzenegger rebukes Trump and compares Capitol riot to Kristallnacht |last=Pengelly |first=Martin |work=The Guardian |date=10 January 2021 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/10/capitol-riot-schwarzenegger-rebukes-trump-kristallnacht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2021, Schwarzenegger was interviewed by ''[[Politico]]'' about the upcoming [[2021 California gubernatorial recall election|recall election in California]] in which he said that "it's pretty much the same atmosphere today as it was then",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/arnold-schwarzenegger-newsom-california-recall-478575|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger has a warning for Gavin Newsom|date=March 31, 2021|publisher=[[Politico]]|website=politico.com|last=Marinucci|first=Carla}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when he was asked about Newsom's claim of this being a "Republican recall" he responded that "this recall effort is sparked by ordinary folks, and that this isn't a power grab by Republicans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arnold-schwarzenegger-newsom-recall-governor-republican|title=Newsom recall effort is sparked by 'ordinary people,' not Republican 'power grab': Arnold Schwarzenegger|date=March 31, 2021|publisher=[[Fox News|FOX News]]|website=foxnews.com|last=Fordham|first=Evie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2021/04/01/former-california-gov-schwarzenegger-warns-newsom-to-take-looming-recall-election-seriously/|title=Former California Gov.
