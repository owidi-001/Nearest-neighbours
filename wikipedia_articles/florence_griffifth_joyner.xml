Legacy.com. December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the world records she set in 1988 for both the [[100 m]] and [[200 m]] still stand. 
During the late 1980s she became a popular figure due to both her record-setting athleticism and eclectic personal style.

Griffith-Joyner was born and raised in [[California]]. She was athletic from a young age and began running track meets as a child. While attending [[California State University, Northridge]] (CSUN) and [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), she continued to compete in track and field. While still in college, Griffith-Joyner qualified for the 100 m [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]], although she did not actually compete due to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S. boycott]]. She made her Olympic debut four years later, winning a silver medal in the 200 meter distance at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] held in Los Angeles. At the [[1988 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|1988 U.S. Olympic trials]], Griffith set a new world record in the 100 meter sprint. She went on to win three gold medals at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]].

In February 1989, she abruptly retired. After her retirement from athletics, Griffith-Joyner remained a pop culture figure through endorsement deals, acting, and designing. She died in her sleep as the result of an [[epileptic seizure]] in 1998 at the age of 38.

== Early life ==
Griffith was born in [[Los Angeles]], California, seventh of eleven children born to Robert, an electrician and Florence Griffith, a seamstress.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099786,00.html|title=Flashy Florence Griffith Joyner Will Be the One to Watch—and Clock—in the Women's Sprints : People.com|date=August 29, 1988|website=www.people.com|access-date=July 22, 2016|volume=30|issue=9|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914215523/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099786,00.html|archive-date=September 14, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in [[Littlerock, California]] before Florence Griffith moved with her children to the [[Jordan Downs]] public housing complex located in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] section of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/local/me-54154|title=School Renamed for Late Track Star Griffith Joyner|last=BRIGGS|first=JOHNATHON E.|date=January 15, 2000|work=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=July 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819102144/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/local/me-54154|archive-date=August 19, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawattstimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=342:the-mother-behind-the-olympian-reveals-the-spirit-that-was-flo-jo&amp;catid=12&amp;Itemid=110|title=The mother behind the Olympian reveals the spirit that was Flo Jo|last=Childs|first=Joy|date=August 10, 2012|website=lawattstimes.com|access-date=July 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705094757/http://lawattstimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=342:the-mother-behind-the-olympian-reveals-the-spirit-that-was-flo-jo&amp;catid=12&amp;Itemid=110|archive-date=July 5, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Griffith was in elementary school, she joined the Sugar Ray Robinson Organization, running in track meets on weekends.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She won the Jesse Owens National Youth Games two years in a row, at the ages of 14 and 15.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_griffith_joyner_florence.html|title=ESPN Classic - FloJo sets 100 record at 1988 Olympic Trials|last=Schwartz|first=Kris|date=July 16, 1998|website=espn.go.com|access-date=July 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521075523/http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_griffith_joyner_florence.html|archive-date=May 21, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith ran track at [[Jordan High School (Los Angeles, California)|Jordan High School]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the first race of the quarterfinals of the [[1988 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|U.S. Olympic Trials]], she stunned her colleagues when she sprinted 100 meters in 10.49 seconds, a new world record.{{efn|[[Evelyn Ashford]] held the previous record at the 100-meter distance with a time of 10.76 seconds.}} &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Over the two day trials, Griffith-Joyner recorded the three fastest times for a woman at 100 meters: 10.49 in the quarter-final, 10.70 in the semi-final, and 10.61 in the finals.&lt;ref name="Hersh, Phil" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; At the same Olympic trials Griffith-Joyner also set an American record at the 200-meter distance with a time of 21.77 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf|title=The History of the United States Olympic Trials -- Track and Field|last=Hymans|first=Richard|date=2008|publisher=USATF|page=30|access-date=August 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620000346/http://usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf|archive-date=June 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary result raised the possibility of a technical malfunction with the wind gauge which read at 0.0&amp;nbsp;m/s - a reading which was at complete odds to the windy conditions on the day with high wind speeds being recorded in all other sprints before and after this race as well as the parallel long jump runway at the time of the Griffith-Joyner performance. All scientific studies commissioned by the IAAF and independent organisations have since confirmed there was an illegal tailwind of between 5&amp;nbsp;m/s – 7&amp;nbsp;m/s at the time. This should have annulled the legality of this result, although the IAAF has chosen not to take this course of action. The legitimate next best wind legal performance would therefore be Griffith-Joyner's 10.61s performance in the final the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Linthorne, N.

Following the Olympic trials, in late July 1988, Griffith-Joyner left coach Kersee saying she wanted a coach able to provide more personal attention.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;--&gt; Another contributing factor was Griffith-Joyner's unhappiness with the lack of sponsorship and endorsement opportunities.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-08-07/sports/8801210104_1_al-joyner-bob-kersee-appearance-fees-and-bonuses|title=Kersee Still Waiting For Reason Griffith Joyner Dropped Him As|last=Hersh|first=Phil|date=August 7, 1988|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=August 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710204940/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-08-07/sports/8801210104_1_al-joyner-bob-kersee-appearance-fees-and-bonuses|archive-date=July 10, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to serving as coach, Kersee was Griffith-Joyner's manager, as he required all the athletes he coached to use his management services too.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Griffith-Joyner's decision to sign with personal manager Gordon Baskin therefore necessitated the coaching change.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Griffith Joyner left UCLA for [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] with her husband serving as full-time coach.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By now known to the world as "Flo-Jo", Griffith-Joyner was the big favorite for the titles in the sprint events at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. In the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's 100 metres|100-meter final]], she ran a 10.54, beating her nearest rival, Evelyn Ashford, by 0.30 seconds. In the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's 200 metres|200 meter semifinal]], she set the world record of 21.56 seconds and then broke this record, winning the final by 0.22 seconds with a time of 21.34 seconds.&lt;ref name="sr" /&gt;

At the same Olympics, Griffith-Joyner also ran with the 4 × 100 m relay and the 4 × 400 m relay teams. Her team won the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's 4 × 100 metres relay|4 × 100 m relay]] and finished second in the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's 4 × 400 metres relay|4 × 400 m relay]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/22/sports/florence-griffith-joyner-38-champion-sprinter-is-dead.html|title=Florence Griffith Joyner, 38, Champion Sprinter, Is Dead|last=Longman|first=Jere|date=September 22, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 30, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830111911/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/22/sports/florence-griffith-joyner-38-champion-sprinter-is-dead.html|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Griffith-Joyner's first internationally rated 4 × 400 m relay.

== Allegations of performance-enhancing drug use ==

{{Quote box|width=27%|align=right|quote=Florence Griffith Joyner is rarely mentioned without an invisible asterisk next to her name when the women's 100 and 200 meters comes around in Olympic year. Current runners bemoan the unreachable bench mark she set. Double Olympic 200 meter gold medalist Veronica Campbell Brown got nowhere near it, saying it was beyond her reach. Former 200 meter Olympic champion Gwen Torrence said that she "did not acknowledge those records ... To me they don't exist and women sprinters are suffering as a result of what she did to the times in the 100 and 200."|source=—James Montague, [[CNN]], August 2012.&lt;ref name="CNN Montague"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saving Flo Jo: Taking back a legacy |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/sport/olympics-flo-jo-seoul/index.html |last=Montague |first=James |access-date=October 4, 2019 |work=CNN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831082605/https://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/sport/olympics-flo-jo-seoul/index.html |archive-date=August 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After her record shattering performances at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials she became an object of suspicion when she arrived at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.&lt;ref name="CNN Montague"/&gt; Athletes, including [[Joaquim Cruz]] and [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], expressed disbelief over Griffith-Joyner's dramatic improvement over a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/160800/p_076.html|title=O doping está no auge|publisher=Veja Online|language=pt|date=August 16, 2000|access-date=February 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203153757/http://veja.abril.com.br/160800/p_076.html|archive-date=February 3, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1988 track and field season, Griffith-Joyner's best time in the 100-meter sprint was 10.96 seconds (set in 1987). In 1988, she improved that by 0.47 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adriansprints.com/2011/12/tribute-florence-griffith-joyner-flo-jo.html |title=Tribute: Florence Griffith Joyner Flo-Jo (1959 - 1998) |website=adriansprints.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303105943/http://www.adriansprints.com/2011/12/tribute-florence-griffith-joyner-flo-jo.html |archive-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 21, 2021}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Her best before 1988 at 200-meters was 21.96 seconds (also set in 1987). In 1988, she improved that by 0.62 seconds to 21.34 seconds, another time that has not been approached. Griffith-Joyner attributed the change in her physique to new health programs.&lt;ref name="speed-glamour-doubt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19980923/26650594.html |title=Speed, glamour, doubt will be Flo-Jo's legacy |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=Express India |date=September 23, 1998 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Joyner]] replaced [[Bob Kersee]] as her coach, and he changed her training program to include more lower body strength training exercises such as squats and lunges.&lt;ref name="dreamchaser"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=090826/flojo |title=Dream Chaser |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130234945/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=090826%2Fflojo |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |url-status=live |first=Tom |last=Friend |website=ESPN |series=Outside the Lines |access-date=July 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said Joyner told him: "if you want to make $1 million, you've got to invest some thousands."&lt;ref name="speed-glamour-doubt"/&gt; Robinson also claimed to receive steroids from coach Bob Kersee, and said he saw [[Carl Lewis]] inject himself with drugs he believed to be testosterone.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;

Robinson never provided any evidence for his allegations and was shunned by the athletics community, leading to the premature end of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athletics-downfall-of-a-man-quick-to-accuse-1200952.html|title=Athletics: Downfall of a man quick to accuse|last=Wright|first=Gerard|date=September 26, 1998|work=The Independent|access-date=June 24, 2017|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912013343/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athletics-downfall-of-a-man-quick-to-accuse-1200952.html|archive-date=September 12, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1988 Olympics Griffith-Joyner retired from competitive track and field, just before the introduction of mandatory random drug testing in 1989.&lt;ref name="CNN Montague"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uneasy"/&gt; She was repeatedly tested during competition, and she passed all of these drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/177433.stm |title=Suspicion surrounds Flo-Jo's death |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622074633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/177433.stm |archive-date=June 22, 2012 |url-status=live |work=BBC News |date=September 23, 1998 |access-date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-13/sports/sp-379_1_random-drug-testing |title=TAC Board Approves Random Drug Testing |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708072942/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-13/sports/sp-379_1_random-drug-testing |archive-date=July 8, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 13, 1989 |access-date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her death in 1998, [[Prince Alexandre de Merode]], the Chairman of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission, claimed that Griffith-Joyner was singled out for extra, rigorous drug testing during the 1988 Olympic Games due to rumors of steroid use. De Merode told ''The New York Times'' that [[Manfred Donike]], who was at that time considered to be the foremost expert on drugs and sports, failed to discover any banned substances during that testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/24/sports/plus-track-and-field-official-defends-griffith-joyner.html?ref=florencegriffithjoyner |title=PLUS: TRACK AND FIELD; Official Defends Griffith Joyner |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627142522/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/24/sports/plus-track-and-field-official-defends-griffith-joyner.html?ref=florencegriffithjoyner |archive-date=June 27, 2017 |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=September 24, 1998 |access-date=May 11, 2014 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Merode was not without controversy himself, having been accused of covering up drug tests at the 1984 Games, and following record shattering performances by Chinese swimmers in the 1990s, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] was created, effectively removing control of drug testing from the IOC and De Merode. On Flo-Jo, De Merode later said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We performed all possible and imaginable analyses on her. We never found anything. There should not be the slightest suspicion.&lt;ref name="CNN Montague"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Death ==
On September 21, 1998, Griffith-Joyner died in her sleep at home in the Canyon Crest neighborhood of [[Mission Viejo, California]], at the age of 38. The unexpected death was investigated by the Orange County Sheriff-[[Coroner]]'s office, which announced on September 22 that the cause of death was suffocation during a severe [[epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref name="uneasy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/04/cov_04newsa/|title=The Uneasy Death Of Florence Griffith Joyner|work=salon.com|first=Kristina Rebelo|last=Anderson|access-date=June 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705004107/http://www.salon.com/1998/12/04/cov_04newsa/|archive-date=July 5, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also found to have had a [[cavernous hemangioma]], a congenital vascular brain abnormality that made Joyner subject to seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/199306.stm|title=Seizure was brought on by a congenital defect in Griffith Joyner's brain|work=BBC|date=October 23, 1998|access-date=January 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103171814/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/199306.stm|archive-date=January 3, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a family attorney, she had suffered a [[Generalised tonic-clonic seizure|tonic-clonic seizure]] in 1990, and had also been treated for seizures in 1993 and 1994. According to the Sheriff-Coroner's office, the only drugs in her system when she died were small amounts of two common over-the-counter drugs, [[acetaminophen]] ([[paracetamol]]) and the antihistamine [[Benadryl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/23/sports/sp-35391 | title=Seizure Led to FloJo's Death | date=October 23, 1998 | author=Jeff Gottlieb | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | access-date=December 26, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114232820/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/23/sports/sp-35391 | archive-date=January 14, 2017 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
