'''LeBron Raymone James Sr.''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɒ|n}}; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Widely considered one of the best players in NBA history, James is frequently compared to [[Michael Jordan]] in debates over the greatest basketball player ever.&lt;!-- NOTE: This aspect is sourced, and is in the lead because it is a part of his legacy; see the Legacy section. The sources are clear that James is often (not just sometimes) referred to as the greatest basketball player and is therefore often compared to Jordan for the title of the greatest basketball player.--&gt;&lt;ref name="GOAT debate"&gt;Various reliable sources have commented on James often being considered the greatest basketball player of all-time and therefore whether or not he has surpassed Jordan as the greatest; see as examples:

His accomplishments include four NBA championships, four [[NBA MVP]] awards, four [[NBA Finals MVP]] awards, and two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold medals]]. During his 17-year career, James holds the record for [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders|all-time playoffs points]], is third in [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|all-time points]], and eighth in [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists]]. James has been selected to the [[All-NBA Team]] a record 17 times (with a record of 13 First Team selections and 11 consecutive First Team selections, the latter of which is shared with Jordan and [[Karl Malone]]), made the [[NBA All-Defensive First Team]] five times, and has been named an [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] 17 times, including three [[NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]] selections.

James played basketball for [[St. Vincent–St. Mary High School]] in his hometown of [[Akron, Ohio]], where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A [[prep-to-pro]], he was selected by Cleveland with the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] of the [[2003 NBA draft]]. Named the [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04]] [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a [[Free agent (NBA)|free agent]] with Miami. This move was announced in an [[ESPN]] special titled ''[[The Decision (TV program)|The Decision]]'', and is one of the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]], he led the Cavaliers to victory over the [[Golden State Warriors]] in the [[2016 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] by [[Comeback (sports)|coming back]] from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the franchise's first championship and ending [[Cleveland sports curse|Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought]]. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the [[2020 NBA Finals|2020 championship]] and was awarded his fourth Finals MVP. In 2021, James became the first player in [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Wimbish |first=Jasmyn |date=July 22, 2021 |title=LeBron James becomes first player in NBA history to make $1 billion in earnings while still playing |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-becomes-first-player-in-nba-history-to-make-1-billion-in-earnings-while-still-playing/ |access-date=2021-07-24 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning a [[Sports Emmy Award]] for a documentary as an [[executive producer]]), and television commercials. He has hosted the [[ESPY Awards]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and won 19 ESPY Awards himself. He also appeared in films such as ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]'' and ''[[Space Jam: A New Legacy]]''. James has been a part-owner of [[Liverpool F.C.]] since 2011, with the club winning the 2018–2019 [[UEFA Champions League]] and 2019–2020 [[Premier League]]. Having become more involved in philanthropic and activist pursuits later in his career, James's charitable organization, the LeBron James Family Foundation, helped open [[I Promise School|an elementary school]], housing complex, and community center and retail plaza in his hometown of Akron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=Sean|date=December 15, 2020|title=Exclusive: LeBron James to Open New Community Hub in Akron|url=https://time.com/5921157/lebron-james-house-three-thirty-akron/|access-date=May 19, 2021|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James was born on December 30, 1984, in [[Akron, Ohio]], to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth.&lt;ref name="Jones2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ryan |title=King James: Believe the Hype |year=2003 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-34992-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingjames00ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Donegan |first=Lawrence |date=March 2, 2003 |title=America's most wanted |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/mar/02/ussport |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422224142/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/mar/02/ussport |archive-date=April 22, 2021 |access-date=May 29, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.&lt;ref name=jockbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/James/James_bio.html|title=LeBron James Biography|website=JockBio.com|access-date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Nichols |first=Rachel |date=July 30, 2018 |title=LeBron James opens up on his new school, the Lakers and life's challenges |url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24194051/lebron-james-discusses-opening-public-school-akron-move-los-angeles-lakers-nba |access-date=July 31, 2018 |website=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later played [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.&lt;ref name=jockbio /&gt; The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, [[Dru Joyce|Dru Joyce III]], and Willie McGee.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The group dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|27}} In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend [[St. Vincent–St. Mary High School]], a private [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school with predominantly [[Caucasian race|white]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Covert|first=Colin|title=Movie review: Band of brothers in 'More Than a Game'|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/movies/64387712.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUnc5PDiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|access-date=July 1, 2012|date=October 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102803/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/movies/64387712.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUnc5PDiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr|archive-date=December 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High school career==
===Basketball===
As a freshman, James averaged 21 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary [[Varsity sports|varsity]] basketball team.&lt;ref name=Prospect&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospect Profile: LeBron James|url=http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/JamesLeBron.html|website=NBA.com|access-date=March 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709135603/http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/JamesLeBron.html|archive-date=July 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fighting Irish went {{nowrap|27–0}} en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee Morgan |first1=David |last2=Gaffney |first2=Tom |date=March 26, 2000 |title=Winning one for Carter |page=D8 |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21535260/lebron_james_hs_freshman/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=July 3, 2018}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] and 3.8 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game.&lt;ref name="nbabio"/&gt; For some home games during the season, {{nowrap|St. Vincent–St. Mary}} played at the [[University of Akron]]'s 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abrams|first=Jonathan|title=Heading Home to Celebrate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/sports/basketball/03lebron.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 30, 2012|date=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; For his outstanding play, James was named [[Ohio Mr. Basketball]] and selected to the [[USA Today All-USA high school basketball team|''USA Today'' All-USA First Team]], becoming the first sophomore to do either.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt;

Before the start of his junior year, James was featured in ''[[SLAM Magazine|Slam]]'', an American basketball magazine, and writer Ryan Jones lauded him as possibly "the best high school basketball player in America right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Jones|first=Ryan|title=Ohio Player|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2012/05/ohio-player-lebron-james-first/|magazine=[[SLAM Magazine]]|access-date=May 27, 2012|date=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, James also appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|104}} With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the ''USA Today'' All-USA First Team,&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; and became the first junior to be named male basketball [[Gatorade National Player of the Year]].&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|117}} St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|114}} Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the [[2002 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/nba-s-educational-requirement-bf2bc2e227f74443|title=What Is the NBA's Educational Requirement?|website=Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/books/09garner.html|title=An N.B.A. Giant and How He Grew|access-date=May 3, 2010|date=September 9, 2009|page=C1|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Garner, Dwight}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he used [[marijuana]], which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|access-date=January 30, 2018|date=July 24, 2009|title=LeBron's Book Shows Struggle With Fame|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/24/entertainment/main5185971.shtml|last=Withers|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against [[Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]] that was nationally televised on [[ESPN2]].&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|142}} [[Time Warner Cable]], looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to subscribers on a [[pay-per-view]] basis throughout the season.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|143}} For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the ''USA Today'' All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|178}} and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the [[EA Sports]] [[Roundball Classic]], the [[Jordan Brand Classic|Jordan Capital Classic]], and the [[2003 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|McDonald's All-American Game]]—losing his [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.&lt;ref name=Free/&gt;

Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a [[Hummer H2]] as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA superstar.&lt;ref name=SUV&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=January 27, 2003|access-date=March 8, 2009|title=Prep star James can continue drive for state title|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0127/1499490.html|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted an investigation by the [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.&lt;ref name=Free/&gt; Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.&lt;ref name=Free&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=January 31, 2003|access-date=March 8, 2009|agency=ESPN.com News Services|title=James ruled ineligible, plans to appeal decision|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0131/1502001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year.
