After self-releasing their independent album ''We Like Digging?'', the band signed to [[Reprise Records]] and released the album ''[[The Fourth World (album)|The Fourth World]]'' in 1997.

In 2010, the band released the third album ''[[Hands All Over (album)|Hands All Over]]'', to mixed reviews, re-releasing a year later to include the single "[[Moves like Jagger]]", which topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. In 2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician [[PJ Morton]], as the band released the fourth album ''[[Overexposed (album)|Overexposed]]'', with the song "[[One More Night (Maroon 5 song)|One More Night]]", topping the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks.

In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album ''[[V (Maroon 5 album)|V]]'' (pronounced "five"),&lt;!--WARNING!, Do not remove this sentence--&gt; with the band signed to [[Interscope Records]] and Levine's own label [[222 Records]]. Following the release of ''V'', it reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band continued for the sixth studio album ''[[Red Pill Blues]]'', which was released in November 2017. With the addition of Morton and Farrar, the band's lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums "[[Sugar (Maroon 5 song)|Sugar]]" and "[[Girls Like You]]" peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively. The band's seventh album, ''[[Jordi (album)|Jordi]]'', was released in June 2021.

==History==
===1994–2001: Kara's Flowers and the formation of Maroon 5===
[[Adam Levine]] was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old and Dusick was 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internettrash.com/users/karasflowers/bandbio.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417125552/http://internettrash.com/users/karasflowers/bandbio.html |archive-date=April 17, 2001 |title=Kara's Flowers bio |work=The InternetTrash|access-date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending [[Brentwood School (Los Angeles)|Brentwood School]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=susan&gt;Visakowitz, Susan, "Sophomore Jump". They were inspired by August Calderon ''Billboard''. '''119''' (17)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoard2"&gt;Hoard, Christian (2004-06-45), "A Whiter Shade of Funk". ''Rolling Stone'' (950):43–44&lt;/ref&gt; While attending Brentwood School, Adam Levine and [[Jesse Carmichael]] joined up with [[Mickey Madden]] and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers,&lt;ref name=amg&gt;{{cite web|last=McIntosh|first=Gregory |title=Kara's flowers |website=AllMusic |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p215827|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Rock music|rock]] band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a "collective crush" on.&lt;ref name="hoard2"/&gt; While they were playing a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter [[John DeNicola]], who is known for his work on ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987){{spaced ndash}}including "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]". Producer [[Rob Cavallo]]'s management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with [[Reprise Records]], re-recording the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimpel|first=Dan|title=How they made it: true stories of how music's biggest stars went from start to stardom!|year=2006|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-634-07642-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtheymadeittru0000kimp/page/87 87]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howtheymadeittru0000kimp/page/87}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the release of ''[[The Fourth World (album)|The Fourth World]]'', during Levine and Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s [[Britpop]].&lt;ref name="hoard2"/&gt; Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their [[lead single]], "Soap Disco", was a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Kimpel 2006, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Levine, the failure of the album was "a huge disappointment" that nearly led them to break up in 1998.&lt;ref name="hoard2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;Rosen, Craig (June 5, 2005), "Gold 5". ''Billboard''. '''117''' (23):&lt;/ref&gt; The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after one month.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

Dusick and Madden attended college locally at [[University of California, Los Angeles]], while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend [[Five Towns College]], in [[Dix Hills, New York|Dix Hills]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maroon5.com/bio/ |title=Bio |publisher=Archive of early band biography on Maroon 5 official site |date=September 28, 2008 |access-date=February 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214043805/http://www.maroon5.com/bio/ |archive-date=February 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maroon 5|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/search?q=%22adam+levine%22&amp;searchBtn=Search&amp;isQuickSearch=true|access-date=December 26, 2020|archive-date=February 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207151147/https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/search?q=%22adam+levine%22&amp;searchBtn=Search&amp;isQuickSearch=true|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the band returned in 2001, they brought those influences with them.&lt;ref name=rosen /&gt; [[Sam Farrar]] (bassist of the band [[Phantom Planet]]) explained that the [[Aaliyah]] song "[[Are You That Somebody?]]" affected the band and influenced the song "Not Coming Home".&lt;ref name="hoard2"/&gt; Producer [[Tim Sommer]] signed them to a demo deal with [[MCA Records]] and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles in the middle of 2001, with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer's advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of [[Octone Records]] executives [[James Diener]], Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum.&lt;ref name=rosen /&gt; While looking for talent for the Octone label, Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at [[Columbia Records]] and the song that caught his attention was {{"'}}Sunday Morning{{'"}} which he referred to as a "genius song".&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_BenBerkman_int.html |title=Interview with Ben Berkman |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=April 13, 2004 |access-date=November 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825150610/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_BenBerkman_int.html |archive-date=August 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara's Flowers, because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at [[Warner Bros.

Berkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at [[The Viper Room]] for the four-piece Kara's Flowers.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told [[HitQuarters]] he believed what the band needed was a "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so he could be the star I perceived him to be".&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. [[James Valentine (musician)|James Valentine]] (from the L.A. band [[Square (band)|Square]]) was recruited for the job.&lt;ref name=rosen /&gt; On his joining the band, Valentine commented: "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them."&lt;ref name=rosen /&gt; After hearing Levine play, Valentine noticed his affinity for Phish and the two musicians bonded over the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://relix.com/blogs/detail/tbt-what-is-the-theme-of-this-everlasting-spoof-thoughts-on-phish/|title=TBT: Maroon 5's Thoughts On Phish|work=Relix|last=Greenhaus|first=Mike|date=April 23, 2020|access-date=April 23, 2020|archive-date=August 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803195720/https://relix.com/blogs/detail/tbt-what-is-the-theme-of-this-everlasting-spoof-thoughts-on-phish/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Valentine attended [[Berklee College of Music]] with [[John Mayer]] in 1996, where they developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at a Mayer radio broadcast. After Mayer heard their album, he was so impressed (particularly by "This Love", which became the most successful release off the album and propelled the band to superstardom) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour.&lt;ref name="hoard2"/&gt; The first single, "[[Harder to Breathe]]", slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album. By March 2004, the album had reached the Top 20 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and "Harder to Breathe" had made the Top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles charts.

At the start of their [[Overexposed Tour]] in South America, Maroon 5 introduced the newest addition in the band to the audience: their old and close friend [[Sam Farrar]] on guitars, occasionally on the bass guitar, percussion, additional keyboards, backing vocals and providing samples and other special effects (using the [[Music Production Controller|MPC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voice21.justyouth.org.uk/features/maroon-5-line-up-change/ |title=Maroon 5 line up change |publisher=Voice21 |access-date=October 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025093339/http://voice21.justyouth.org.uk/features/maroon-5-line-up-change/ |archive-date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrar co-wrote and co-produced a few of the band's songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed their song "Woman" on ''[[Call and Response: The Remix Album]]'', released in 2008 (for the original version from the [[Spider-Man 2 (soundtrack)|''Spider-Man 2'' soundtrack]]).

The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like "[[This Love (Maroon 5 song)|This Love]]", "[[Makes Me Wonder]]" and "[[Misery (Maroon 5 song)|Misery]]" have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as "[[She Will Be Loved]]" and "[[Never Gonna Leave This Bed]]" express a longing for a romantic relationship. "[[Makes Me Wonder]]" has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/politics-without-preaching/story-e6frfn79-1111113447292 |work=The Australian |title=Politics without preaching |date=May 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604153003/http://www.news.com.au/politics-without-preaching/story-e6frfn79-1111113447292 |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's style changes from album to album. ''[[Songs About Jane]]'' consists of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. On ''[[It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]'', however, the songs are less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a [[retro]] feel. ''[[Hands All Over (album)|Hands All Over]]'' continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single "Moves like Jagger", an [[electropop]] song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. "It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk", Levine said. "It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm just glad that everyone likes it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467561/adam-levine-calls-moves-like-jagger-a-risk-for-maroon-5-video-interview|title=Adam Levine Calls 'Moves Like Jagger' a 'Risk' for Maroon 5: Video Interview|work=Billboard|access-date=December 16, 2012|archive-date=May 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528174632/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467561/adam-levine-calls-moves-like-jagger-a-risk-for-maroon-5-video-interview|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Valentine called ''[[Overexposed (album)|Overexposed]]'' "our most 'pop' record ever and we weren't shy about really going for it".&lt;ref name=overexposed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maroon5.com/news_detail/fourth_album_overexposed_june_26th/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328211541/http://www.maroon5.com/news_detail/fourth_album_overexposed_june_26th|archive-date=March 28, 2012|title=Fourth album 'Overexposed' June 26th |publisher=Maroon 5 |date= March 26, 2012 |access-date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have experimented with [[new wave music|new wave]]&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ann Powers |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/cl-et-maroon522-story.html |title=Maroon 5 |newspaper=LA Times |access-date=April 16, 2020 |archive-date=August 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804091345/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/cl-et-maroon522-story.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idolator"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kathy Iandoli |url=http://www.idolator.com/7533427/maroon-5-v-album-review |title=Maroon 5's ''V'': Album Review |publisher=Idolator |date=September 2, 2014 |access-date=December 27, 2015 |archive-date=May 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20160507193745/http://www.idolator.com/7533427/maroon-5-v-album-review |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pluggedin.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/music-reviews/album/maroon-5-v/ |title=V Album Review (2014) |publisher=PluggedIn |access-date=December 27, 2015 |archive-date=January 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105062917/http://www.pluggedin.com/music-reviews/album/maroon-5-v/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[disco]]&lt;ref name=rollingstonereview&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|title=Overexposed &amp;#124; Album Reviews &amp;#124; Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/overexposed-20120626|access-date=June 26, 2012|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 26, 2012|archive-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626223356/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/overexposed-20120626|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Morning Call"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2007-08-04/features/3748762_1_boy-bands-pop-rock-maroon|title=MAROON 5 "IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG" (Octone/A&amp;M)|newspaper=The Morning Call|access-date=March 17, 2016|archive-date=July 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710130543/http://articles.mcall.com/2007-08-04/features/3748762_1_boy-bands-pop-rock-maroon|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; sounds on several albums.

==Controversies==

In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in November 2018, the frontman of the band, Adam Levine, when asked if the band is pop, rock or urban, said, "Something unique to this band is that we have always looked to hip-hop, R&amp;B, all rhythmic forms of music, from back when we were writing our first album to now. Rock music is nowhere, really. I don’t know where it is. If it’s around, no one’s invited me to the party. All of the innovation and the incredible things happening in music are in hip-hop".&lt;ref name="Rock will never die"&gt;|{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/features/adam-levine-maroon-5-jordan-feldstein-1203036920/|publisher=Variety|title=How Adam Levine Took Control of His Career After Manager's Tragic Death|date=n.d.|access-date=4 December 2018|archive-date=August 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803212046/https://variety.com/2018/music/features/adam-levine-maroon-5-jordan-feldstein-1203036920/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement prompted widespread criticism from rock fans and some rockstars such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]'s frontman [[Corey Taylor]]. Despite this backlash, the band saw a continued increase in popularity and commercial success in 2018, leading them to become one of the world's best-selling pop bands. They continue to collaborate with Hip-Hop artists and create mostly pop music.&lt;ref name="Band Genres"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3758b/a-brief-history-of-maroon-5s-corny-collaborations-with-rappers|publisher=VICE|title=A Brief History of Maroon 5's Corny Collaborations With Rappers|date=29 November 2017|access-date=4 December 2018|archive-date=March 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327184111/https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3758b/a-brief-history-of-maroon-5s-corny-collaborations-with-rappers|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of band"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/5-bands-that-were-sucked-by-the-pop-monster-and-became-crappy.amp|publisher=ODDYSEY|title=5 Bands That Were Sucked By The Pop Monster And Became Crappy|date=18 July 2016|access-date=4 December 2018|archive-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204151642/https://www.theodysseyonline.com/5-bands-that-were-sucked-by-the-pop-monster-and-became-crappy.amp|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2020, the band performed at the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]] in Chile. The performance, which began 29 minutes late, was listed as "mediocre" by part of the press. Mark Savage of the [[BBC]] said that Levine performed the songs with a "lack of energy" and was "out of tune", adding that the disappointment of some fans increased when videos were leaked. The videos showed Levine when he was leaving the stage, angry and saying that "they were deceived", "that was a TV show! ... that was not a concert", and that Viña del Mar is a "shitty city," sparking criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/entertainment-arts-51675873|title=Maroon 5 criticised for 'reluctant' festival performance in Chile|work=[[BBC News]]|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=February 29, 2020|archive-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228205106/https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/entertainment-arts-51675873|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine later posted on Instagram to apologize for the incident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/1127037/adam-levine-addresses-maroon-5-s-unprofessional-performance-at-chilean-music-festival|title=Adam Levine Addresses Maroon 5's "Unprofessional" Performance at Chilean Music Festival|work=[[E!
