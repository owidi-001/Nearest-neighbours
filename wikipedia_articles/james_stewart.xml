'''James Maitland Stewart''' (May 20, 1908 – July 2, 1997) was an American actor. Known for his distinctive drawl and everyman screen persona, Stewart's film career spanned 80 films from 1935 to 1991. With the strong morality he portrayed both on and off the screen, he epitomized the "American ideal" in the twentieth century. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked him third on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest American male actors]].&lt;ref name="AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars |website=American Film Institute (Afi.com) |date=June 16, 1999 |access-date=June 22, 2013 |archive-date=October 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025072655/http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and raised in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], Stewart started acting while studying at [[Princeton University]]. After graduating in 1932, he began a career as a stage actor, appearing on Broadway and in summer stock productions.  In 1935, he landed his first of several supporting roles in movies and in 1938 he had his big breakthrough in [[Frank Capra]]'s ensemble comedy ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]''. The following year, Stewart garnered his first of five [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] nominations for his portrayal of an idealized and virtuous man who becomes a senator in Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939). He won his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his work in the comedy ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), which also starred [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Cary Grant]].

A licensed amateur pilot, Stewart enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] soon after the United States entered the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1941. After fighting in the European theater, he attained the rank of colonel and received several awards for his service. He remained in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|U.S. Air Force Reserve]] and was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1959. He retired in 1968 and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|United States Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]] would later promote Stewart to the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the Air Force retired list, in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Morrow|first=Tom|date=October 1, 2017|title=Historically Speaking: From Actor to Major General and Back|url=https://www.osidenews.com/2017/10/01/historically-speaking-actor-major-general-back/|access-date=December 19, 2020|website=OsideNews|archive-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218091418/http://www.osidenews.com/2017/10/01/historically-speaking-actor-major-general-back/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's first postwar role was as [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]] in Capra's ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946). Although it earned him an Oscar nomination, the film was not a big success at first. It has increased in popularity since its release, and is considered a Christmas classic and one of Stewart's most famous performances. In the 1950s, Stewart played darker, more morally ambiguous characters in movies directed by [[Anthony Mann]], including ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950), ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958). ''Vertigo'' was ignored by critics upon release, but is now recognized as an American cinematic masterpiece. His other films in the 1950s included the Broadway adaptation ''[[Harvey (1950 film)|Harvey]]'' (1950) and the courtroom drama ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), both of which landed him Academy Award nominations. He was one of the most popular film stars of the decade, with most of his films becoming box office successes.

Stewart's later Westerns included ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962) and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964), both directed by [[John Ford]]. He appeared in many popular family comedies during the 1960s. After a brief venture into television acting, Stewart semi-retired by the 1980s. He received many honorary awards, including an [[Academy Honorary Award]] and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], both in 1985.

Stewart remained unmarried until his 40s and was dubbed "The Great American Bachelor" by the press. In 1949, he married former model [[Gloria Hatrick McLean]]. They had twin daughters, and he adopted her two sons from her previous marriage. The marriage lasted until McLean's death in 1994; Stewart died of a [[pulmonary embolism]] three years later.

==Early life==
[[File:Stewart&amp;#039;s Family 1918.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Stewart family in 1918]]
James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]],{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=19}} the eldest child and only son born to Elizabeth Ruth (''née'' Jackson; 1875–1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (1872–1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=348}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=22–24, 239}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart had two younger sisters, Mary (1912–1977) and Virginia (1914–1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of Scottish and [[Ulster-Scot]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006 11–12"&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=11–12}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stewart family had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006 11–12"/&gt; Stewart's father ran the family business, the J.M. Stewart and Company Hardware Store, which he hoped Stewart would take over as an adult after attending [[Princeton University]], as was the family tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2005|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=14–17}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised a [[Presbyterian]] by his deeply-religious father, Stewart was a devout church-goer for much of his life.&lt;ref name="Eliot 2006 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2017|pp=258, 271}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's mother was a pianist, and music was an important part of family life.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=15}} When a customer at the store was unable to pay his bill, Stewart's father accepted an old accordion as payment. Stewart learned to play the instrument with the help of a local barber.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=14–15}} His accordion became a fixture offstage during his acting career.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|pp=230, 344, 390}} A shy child, Stewart spent much of his time after school in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawings and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|pp=35–38}} He attended the Wilson Model School for primary school and junior high school. He was not a gifted student and received average to low grades. According to his teachers, this was not from a lack of intelligence, but due to being creative and having a tendency to daydream.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=30}}
[[File:Alexander Stewart hardware store.jpg|thumb|Stewart (right) and Alexander Stewart (high center) in front of the family hardware store in 1930]]
Stewart began attending [[Mercersburg Academy]] prep school in fall 1923, because his father did not believe he would be accepted into Princeton if he attended public high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=25–32}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Mercersburg, Stewart participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. He was a member of the track team (competing as a high jumper under coach [[Jimmy Curran]]),{{sfn|Adams|2017|pp=75–78}} the art editor of the school yearbook, a member of the [[glee club]],{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=80}} and a member of the John Marshall Literary Society.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=27}} To his disappointment, he was relegated to the third-tier football team due to his slender physique.{{sfn|Eliot |2006|p=27}} Stewart also made his first onstage appearance at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play ''The Wolves'' in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; During summer breaks, he returned to Indiana, working first as a brick loader and then as a magician's assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=27}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|pp=82, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[scarlet fever]] that turned into a kidney infection, he had to take time out from school in 1927, which delayed his graduation until 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained passionate about aviation, with his interest enhanced by [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s first solo transatlantic flight, but abandoned visions of becoming a pilot when his father steered him towards Princeton.{{sfn|Quirk|1997|p=14}}

Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932, majoring in architecture and becoming a member of the [[Princeton Charter Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=32, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He excelled academically, but also  became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the [[Princeton Triangle Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~triangle/content_page/history.html "Princeton Triangle Club"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002221003/http://www.princeton.edu/~triangle/content_page/history.html |date=October 2, 2011 }}. ''princeton.edu''. Retrieved January 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his graduation in 1932, he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies in architecture for his thesis on an airport terminal design,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2017|p=40}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; but chose instead to join [[University Players]], an intercollegiate summer stock company performing in [[West Falmouth, Massachusetts]], on [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2017|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Campus |journal=The Princeton Alumni Weekly |volume=29 |issue=28 |page=874 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBJbAAAAYAAJ |access-date=August 8, 2019|year=1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{see also|List of awards and nominations received by James Stewart}}

===Theater and early film roles, 1932—1937===
Stewart performed in bit parts in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=51–52}} The company's directors included [[Joshua Logan]], [[Bretaigne Windust]] and Charles Leatherbee,{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=17}} and amongst its other actors were married couple [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Margaret Sullavan]], who became Stewart's close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2017|pp=42–43}}; {{harvnb|Fonda|Teichmann|1981|p=74}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|pp=23, 97, 105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Stewart moved to New York with his Players friends Logan, [[Myron McCormick]], and newly single Henry Fonda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=50–54}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2017|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flint |first1=Peter B. |title=Henry Fonda Dies on Coast at 77; Played 100 Stage and Screen Roles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/13/obituaries/henry-fonda-dies-on-coast-at-77-played-100-stage-and-screen-roles.html |access-date=August 8, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=August 13, 1982 |archive-date=August 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808174512/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/13/obituaries/henry-fonda-dies-on-coast-at-77-played-100-stage-and-screen-roles.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with McCormick, Stewart debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the brief run of ''[[Carry Nation (play)|Carry Nation]]'' and a few weeks later – again with McCormick – appeared as a chauffeur in the comedy ''Goodbye Again'', in which he had a walk-on line.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=109}} ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commented, "Mr. James Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause."{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=57}} Following the seven-month run of ''Goodbye Again'', Stewart took a stage manager position in [[Boston]], but was fired after frequently missing his cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=61}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to New York, he then landed a small part in ''Spring in Autumn'' and a role in ''All Good Americans'', where he was required to throw a banjo out of the window.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=61–62}} [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Throwing a $250 banjo out of the window at the concierge is constructive abuse and should be virtuously applauded."{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=62}} Both plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=61}}
[[File:Yellow Jack Play 1934.jpg|thumb|Stewart in ''[[Yellow Jack (play)|Yellow Jack]]'', in which he starred on Broadway in 1934 and which garnered him critical praise.]]
Stewart was convinced to continue acting when he was cast in the lead role of ''[[Yellow Jack (play)|Yellow Jack]]'', playing a soldier who becomes the subject of a [[yellow fever]] experiment.{{sfnm|1a1=Dewey|1y=1996|1p=123|2a1=Eliot|2y=2006|2p=62}} It premiered at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theater]] in March 1934. Stewart received unanimous praise from the critics, but the play proved unpopular with audiences and folded by June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=62–63}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, Stewart made his film debut with an unbilled appearance in the [[Shemp Howard]] comedy [[short subject|short]] ''[[Art Trouble]]'' (1934), filmed in [[Brooklyn]], and acted in [[summer stock]] productions of ''We Die Exquisitely'' and ''All Paris Knows'' at the Red Barn Theater on [[Long Island]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=65–68}} In the fall, he again received excellent reviews for his role in ''Divided by Three'' at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], which he followed with the modestly successful ''Page Miss Glory'' and the critical failure ''A Journey By Night'' in spring 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=65–70}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2017|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after ''A Journey By Night'' ended, Stewart signed a seven-year contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), orchestrated by talent scout Bill Grady, who had been tracking Stewart's career since seeing him perform in Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=64–65}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first Hollywood role was a minor appearance in the [[Spencer Tracy]] vehicle ''[[The Murder Man]]'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=72–77}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was largely ignored by critics, although the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', remembering him in ''Yellow Jack'', called him "wasted in a bit that he handles with characteristically engaging skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|1988|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As MGM did not see leading-man material in Stewart, described by biographer Michael D. Rinella as a "lanky young bumpkin with a hesitant manner of speech" during this time, his agent [[Leland Hayward]] decided that the best path for him would be through loan-outs to other studios.{{sfn|Rinella|2019|p=78}}

Stewart had only a small role in his second MGM film, the hit musical ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose Marie]]'' (1936), but it led to his casting in seven other films within one year, from ''Next Time We Love'' to ''After the Thin Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=145}}; {{harvnb|McGowan|1992|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Turk|1998|p=363}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received crucial help from his University Players friend Margaret Sullavan, who campaigned for him to be her leading man in the [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] romantic comedy ''[[Next Time We Love]]'' (1936), filmed right after ''Rose Marie''.

[[File:Speed lobby card 2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Speed (1936 film)|Speed]]'' (1936) was Stewart's first top-billed role at MGM. It was a critical and commercial failure.]]
Stewart followed ''Next Time We Love'' with supporting roles in two commercially successful romantic comedies, ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' (1936) and ''[[Small Town Girl (1936 film)|Small Town Girl]]'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=147}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both, he played the betrayed boyfriend of the leading lady, portrayed by [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Janet Gaynor]], respectively.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=86}} Both films garnered him some good reviews.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=91–92}} After an appearance in the short subject ''Important News'' (1936), Stewart had his first top-billed role in the low-budget [[B movie|"B" movie]] ''[[Speed (1936 film)|Speed]]'' (1936), in which he played a mechanic and speed driver&amp;nbsp;competing in the [[Indianapolis 500]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=92}} The film was a critical and commercial failure,{{sfn|Molyneaux|1992|p=54}} although [[Frank Nugent]] of ''The New York Times'' stated that "Mr. Stewart [and the rest of the cast] perform as pleasantly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nugent |first1=Frank S. |title=Notes in a Minor Key on the Current Opera, 'Speed,' At the Capitol, and the Palace's 'Human Cargo.' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/05/16/archives/notes-in-a-minor-key-on-the-current-opera-speed-at-the-capitol-and.html |access-date=November 4, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1936 |archive-date=November 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105002108/https://www.nytimes.com/1936/05/16/archives/notes-in-a-minor-key-on-the-current-opera-speed-at-the-capitol-and.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his next film, the romantic drama ''[[Seventh Heaven (1937 film)|Seventh Heaven]]'' (1937), Stewart was loaned to [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] to play a Parisian sewer worker in a [[remake]] of [[Frank Borzage]]'s [[7th Heaven (1927 film)|silent classic]] released a decade earlier.

===Leading man (1938–1941)===
Despite good reviews, Stewart was still a minor star and MGM remained hesitant to cast him in leading roles, preferring to loan him out to other studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McBride|2011|p=310}}; {{harvnb|Sarris|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a well-received supporting part in ''[[Of Human Hearts]]'' (1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=86–87}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was loaned to [[RKO]] to act opposite [[Ginger Rogers]] in the romantic comedy ''[[Vivacious Lady]]'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=90–92}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was shut down for months in 1937 as Stewart recovered from an undisclosed illness, during which he was hospitalized. RKO initially wanted to replace Stewart, but eventually the project was canceled. However, Rogers's success in a stage musical caused the film to be picked up again. Stewart was recast in ''Vivacious Lady'' at Rogers's insistence and due to his performance in ''Of Human Hearts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lumenick |first1=Lou |title=Early Bette Davis, James Stewart comes to DVD |url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/08/early-bette-davis-james-stewart-comes-to-dvd/ |access-date=March 19, 2020 |work=New York Post |publisher=NYP Holdings |date=October 8, 2013 |archive-date=March 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319183854/https://nypost.com/2013/10/08/early-bette-davis-james-stewart-comes-to-dvd/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a critical and commercial success, and showed Stewart's talent for performing in romantic comedies;{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=106}} ''[[The New York Herald]]'' called him "one of the most knowing and engaging young actors appearing on the screen at present."{{sfn|Molyneaux|1992|p=65}}

Stewart's third film release of 1938, the [[First World War]]&amp;nbsp;drama ''[[The Shopworn Angel]]'', saw him collaborate again with Margaret Sullavan. In his performance, Stewart drew upon his own feelings of unrequited love towards Sullavan, who was married to his agent, Leland Hayward.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=109–110}} Although the film was otherwise well-received, critics were mixed about Stewart. Bland Johaneson of the ''New York Daily Mirror'' compared him to [[Stan Laurel]] in this melodramatic film and ''Variety'' called his performance unfocused.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=112}} Irene Thier of ''The New York Post'' wrote that his role was "just another proof that this young man is one of the finest actors of the screen's young roster."{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=112}}
[[File:You Can't Take It with You trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart and [[Jean Arthur]]&amp;nbsp;in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938); the film made Stewart a major star.]]
Stewart became a major star when he was loaned out to [[Columbia Pictures]] to play the lead role in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]'' (1938) opposite [[Jean Arthur]].{{sfn|Sarris|1998|p=30}} Stewart played the son of a banker who falls in love with a woman from a poor and eccentric family. Capra had recently completed several well-received films and was looking for a new type of leading man. He had been impressed by Stewart's role in ''Navy Blue and Gold'' (1937). According to Capra, Stewart was one of the best actors ever to hit the screen, understood character archetypes intuitively and required little directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|McBride|2011|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''You Can't Take It With You'' became [[1938 in film|the fifth highest-grossing]] film of the year and won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=113–117}} The film was also critically successful, but while ''Variety'' wrote that the performances of Stewart and Arthur garnered "much of the laughs," most of the critical acclaim went to [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=116–117}}

In contrast to the success of ''You Can't Take It With You'', Stewart's first three film releases of 1939 were all commercial disappointments. In the melodrama ''[[Made for Each Other (1939 film)|Made for Each Other]]'' (1939), he shared the screen with [[Carole Lombard]]. Stewart blamed its directing and screenwriting for its poor box-office performance.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=113–114}} Regardless, the film received favorable reviews,{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=113–114}} with ''[[Newsweek]]'' writing that Stewart and Lombard were "perfectly cast in the leading roles."{{sfn|Jones|McClure|Twomey|1970|p=67}} The other two films, ''[[The Ice Follies of 1939]]'' and ''[[It's a Wonderful World (1939 film)|It's a Wonderful World]]'', were critical failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=119–122}}; {{harvnb|Molyneaux|1992|pp=71–72}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's fourth 1939 film saw him work again with Capra and Jean Arthur in the political comedy-drama ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', in which Stewart played an idealist thrown into the political arena.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=121–122}} It garnered critical praise and became the third-highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref name="WPCleanerAuto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/top-grossing-movies-of-1939/|title=Top Grossing Movies of 1939 – UMR|website=www.ultimatemovierankings.com|access-date=November 11, 2019|archive-date=November 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111090742/http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/top-grossing-movies-of-1939/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=127–128}} ''[[The Nation]]'' stated "[Stewart] takes first place among Hollywood actors...Now he is mature and gives a difficult part, with many nuances, moments of tragic-comic impact."{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=129}} Later, critic Andrew Sarris qualified Stewart's performance as "lean, gangling, idealistic to the point of being neurotic, thoughtful to the point of being tongue-tied," describing him as "particularly gifted in expressing the emotional ambivalence of the action hero."{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=129}} Stewart won the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] award and received his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=127}}

Stewart's last screen appearance of 1939 came in the [[Western movie|Western parody]] ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'', in which he portrayed a pacifist lawman and [[Marlene Dietrich]] a saloon girl who falls in love with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was critically and commercially successful.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=138}} ''TIME'' magazine wrote, "James Stewart, who had just turned in the top performance of his cinematurity as Jefferson Smith in ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'', turns in as good a performance or better as Thomas Jefferson Destry."{{sfn|Molyneaux|1992|p=76}} Between films, Stewart had begun a radio career, and had become a distinctive voice on the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' and other shows. So well-known had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=112}}

[[File:Shop-Around-the-Corner.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart and [[Margaret Sullavan]] in their third collaboration, ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' (1940)]]

Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films in 1940. The [[Ernst Lubitsch]]&amp;nbsp;romantic comedy ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' starred them as co-workers who cannot stand each other but unknowingly become romantic pen-pals. It received good reviews and was a box-office success in Europe, but failed to find an audience in the US, where less-gentle [[screwball comedy|screwball comedies]] were more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=142–145}}; {{harvnb|Rinella|2019|pp=134–137}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Lubitsch assessed it to be the best film of his career, and it has been regarded highly by later critics, such as [[Pauline Kael]]&amp;nbsp;and [[Richard Schickel]].{{sfn|Rinella|2019|pp=135–136}}

The drama ''[[The Mortal Storm]]'', directed by [[Frank Borzage]], featured Sullavan and Stewart as lovers caught in turmoil upon [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s rise to power. It was one of the first blatantly anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] films to be produced in Hollywood, but according to film scholar Ben Urwand, "ultimately made very little impact" as it did not show the persecution experienced by Jews or name that ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Urwand|2013|p=217}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=147–149}}; {{harvnb|Rinella|2019|pp=139–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being well received by critics, it failed at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=148–149}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days after filming ''The Mortal Storm'', Stewart began filming ''[[No Time for Comedy]]'' (1940) with [[Rosalind Russell]]. Critics complimented Stewart's performance; [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' called Stewart "the best thing in the show," yet the film was again not a box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=141–143}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hepburn Stewart Philadelphia Story.jpg|thumb|150px|Stewart with [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), for which he won his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].]]
Stewart's final film to be released in 1940 was [[George Cukor]]'s romantic comedy ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', in which he played an intrusive, fast-talking reporter sent to cover the wedding of a socialite ([[Katharine Hepburn]]) with the help of her ex-husband ([[Cary Grant]]).{{sfn|Eliot |2006|pp=163, 167}} The film became one of the largest box-office successes of the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Film Money-Makers Selected By ''Variety'': ' Sergeant York' Top Picture, Gary Cooper Leading Star |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 31, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received widespread critical acclaim. ''[[The New York Herald Tribune]]'' stated that "Stewart...contributes most of the comedy to the show...In addition, he contributes some of the most irresistible romantic moments."{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=218}} His performance earned him his only Academy Award in a competitive category for Best Actor, beating out Henry Fonda, for whom he had voted and with whom he had once roomed, both almost broke, in the early 1930's in New York. {{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=163, 167, 387}} Stewart himself assessed his performance in ''Mr. Smith'' to be superior, and believed the Academy was recompensing for not giving him the award the year prior.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=166–167}} Moreover, Stewart's character was a supporting role, not the male lead.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=166–167}} He gave the Oscar to his father, who displayed it at his hardware store alongside other family awards and military medals.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=168}}

Stewart next appeared in two comedies—''[[Come Live with Me (film)|Come Live with Me]]'' (1941), which paired him with [[Hedy Lamarr]], and ''[[Pot o' Gold (film)|Pot o' Gold]]'' (1941), featuring [[Paulette Goddard]]—that were both box-office failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart considered the latter to be the worst film of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last film before military service was the musical ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'' (1941), which co-starred [[Judy Garland]], Hedy Lamarr and [[Lana Turner]]. It was a critical failure but also one of the best box-office performers of the year.&lt;ref name="Mannix"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=159–160}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=152}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart became the first major American movie star to enlist in the [[United States Army]] to fight in [[World War II]].{{sfn|Resch|2005|p=180}} His family had deep military roots: both of his grandfathers had fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=11–12}} and his father had served during both the [[Spanish–American War]] and World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; After first being rejected for low weight in November, 1940, he successfully enlisted in February, 1941.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=149–152}}{{refn|group=N|Stewart later confided that he had a "friend" operating the weight scales on his second and successful enlisting attempt.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=30}}}} As an experienced amateur pilot, he reported for induction as a private in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] on March 22, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=213}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=152}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2005|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon to be 33 years old, he was over the age limit for [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet]] training—the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers—and therefore applied for an Air Corps commission as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=31}} Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=273}}

[[File:Winning Your Wings.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=16:03|left|Lieutenant James Stewart in ''[[Winning Your Wings]]'' (1942)]]
After enlisting, Stewart made no new commercial films, although he remained under contract to MGM. His public appearances were limited to engagements for the Army Air Forces.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=31}} The Air Corps scheduled him on network radio with [[Edgar Bergen]] and [[Charlie McCarthy]], and on the radio program ''[[We Hold These Truths]]'', a celebration of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], which was broadcast a week after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Smith|2005|pp=31–32}} Stewart also appeared in a [[First Motion Picture Unit]] short film, ''[[Winning Your Wings]]'', to help recruit airmen.

Stewart was concerned that his celebrity status would relegate him to duties behind the lines.{{sfn|Smith|2005|pp=31–32}} After spending over a year training pilots at [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Army Airfield]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],{{sfn|Smith|2005|pp=263, 271–273}} he appealed to his commander and was sent to England as part of the [[445th Bombardment Group]] to pilot a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]], in November 1943, and was based initially at [[RAF Tibenham]] before moving to [[RAF Old Buckenham]].{{sfn|Smith|2005|pp=49–53, 73}}

Stewart appeared in only one film released in 1951, playing a scientist in Koster's British production ''[[No Highway in the Sky]]'', which was one of the first airplane [[disaster film]]s ever made. Filmed in England, it became a box office success in the United Kingdom, but failed to attract audiences in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thumim|1991|p=258}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart took a small supporting role as a troubled clown in [[Cecil B.

Critics were curious why Stewart had taken such a small, out-of-character role; he responded that he was inspired by [[Lon Chaney]]'s ability to disguise himself while letting his character emerge.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=258–259}} In the same year, Stewart starred in a critically and commercially failed biopic ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' (1952),{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=231}} and continued his collaboration with Mann in ''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952), which was again a commercial and critical success.{{sfn|Molyneaux|1992|pp=110–111}}[[File:Far Country Cropped lobby card.jpg|thumb|Stewart in ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1955)]]Stewart followed ''Bend of the River'' with four more collaborations with Mann in the next two years.

Stewart ended the decade with [[Otto Preminger]]'s realistic courtroom drama ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959) and the crime film ''[[The FBI Story]]'' (1959).

Stewart opened the new decade with an appearance in the war film ''[[The Mountain Road]]'' (1960).

===Television and semi-retirement (1971–1991)===
In 1971, Stewart starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] sitcom ''[[The Jimmy Stewart Show]]''.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=371–379, 382}} He played a small-town college professor, whose adult son moves back home with his family. Stewart disliked the amount of work needed to film the show each week and was relieved when it was canceled after only one season due to bad reviews and lack of audiences.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=378–388}} His only film release for 1971, the comedy-drama Western ''[[Fools' Parade]]'', was more-positively received.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=310–317}} Robert Greenspun of ''The New York Times'' stated that "the movie belongs to Stewart, who has never been more wonderful."{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=323}} For his contributions to Western films, Stewart was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Western Performers |url=https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers/ |website=National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum |access-date=July 15, 2019 |archive-date=April 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419213620/https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/awards-halls-of-fame/great-western-performers/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart returned to television in ''Harvey'' for NBC's [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] series in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brennan |first1=Claire |title=Fabulous furry friend |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/dec/04/theatre |access-date=June 17, 2019 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Limited |date=December 3, 2005 |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617225449/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/dec/04/theatre |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then starred in the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] mystery series ''[[Hawkins (TV series)|Hawkins]]'' in 1973. Playing a small-town lawyer investigating mysterious cases – similar to his character in ''Anatomy of a Murder'' – Stewart won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama|Golden Globe]] for his performance.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=380}} Nevertheless, ''Hawkins'' failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with ''[[Shaft (TV series)|Shaft]]'', which had a starkly conflicting demographic, and was canceled after one season.{{sfn|Hyatt|2003|p=222}} Stewart also periodically appeared on [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', sharing poems he had written at different times in his life.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=391}} His poems were later compiled into a short collection, ''Jimmy Stewart and His Poems'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Krier, Beth Ann.

''Los Angeles Times'', September 10, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stewart|1989}}

After performing again in ''Harvey'' at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in London in 1975, Stewart returned to films with a major supporting role in John Wayne's final film, ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976), playing a doctor giving Wayne's gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=383–384}} By this time, Stewart had a hearing impairment, which affected his ability to hear his cues and led to him repeatedly flubbing his lines; his vanity would not allow him to admit this or to wear a hearing aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|1996|pp=363–364; 456}}; {{harvnb|Shepherd|Slatzer|Grayson|1985|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was offered the role of Howard Beale in ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' (1976), but refused it due to its explicit language.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=393}} Instead, he appeared in supporting roles in the disaster film ''[[Airport '77]]'' (1977), the remake of ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1978), and the family film ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'' (1978). Despite mixed reviews, ''Airport '77'' was a box-office success,{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=341}} but the two other films were commercial and critical failures.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=343–348}} Harry Haun of ''New York Daily News'' wrote in his review of ''The Big Sleep'' that it was "really sad to see James Stewart struggle so earnestly with material that just isn't there."{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=344}} Stewart's final live-action feature film was the critically panned Japanese film ''[[The Green Horizon]]'' (1980), directed by [[Susumu Hani]]. Stewart took the role because the film promoted wildlife conservation and allowed his family to travel with him to [[Kenya]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=349–350}}

In the 1980s, Stewart semi-retired from acting. He was offered the role of Norman Thayer in ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981), but turned it down because he disliked the film's father-daughter relationship; the role went instead to his friend, Henry Fonda.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=393}} Stewart filmed two television movies in the 1980s: ''[[Mr. Krueger's Christmas]]'' (1980), produced by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which allowed him to fulfill a lifelong dream to conduct the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Bauman |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705280308/Utah-Hollywood-connection-runs-deep.html |title=Utah-Hollywood connection runs deep |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=January 26, 2009 |page=B2 |access-date=September 8, 2016 |archive-date=September 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913121049/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705280308/Utah-Hollywood-connection-runs-deep.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Right of Way (film)|Right of Way]]'' (1983), an [[HBO]] drama that co-starred [[Bette Davis]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=358–359}} He also made an appearance in the historical miniseries ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'' in 1986, and did voiceover work for commercials for [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soups]] in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dawson |first1=Greg |title=Stewart Soup Pitch is the Real Thing |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1988-12-12-0090080015-story.html |access-date=June 11, 2019 |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=December 12, 1988 |archive-date=October 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026123014/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1988-12-12-0090080015-story.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's last film performance was voicing the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the animated movie ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'' (1991).

Stewart remained in the public eye due to his frequent visits to the [[White House]] during the [[Reagan administration]].{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=404}} The re-release of Hitchcock films gained him renewed recognition, with ''Rear Window'' and ''Vertigo'' in particular praised by film critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maslin |first1=Janet |title=...And James Stewart Recalls 'Hitch' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/movies/and-james-stewart-recalls-hitch.html |access-date=August 1, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=October 9, 1983 |archive-date=August 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801170456/https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/movies/and-james-stewart-recalls-hitch.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hannan|2016|pp=281–282}} Stewart also received several honorary film industry awards at the end of his career: an [[AFI Life Achievement Award|American Film Institute Award]] in 1980, a [[Silver Bear]] in 1982, [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1985, and [[National Board of Review]]&amp;nbsp;and [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]'s Chaplin Award in 1990.

==Personal life==

===Romantic relationships, marriage, and family===
[[File:The Shopworn Angel trailer.JPG|thumb|left|[[Margaret Sullavan]] and Stewart in ''The Shopworn Angel'' (1938), their second film collaboration.|alt=Stewart and Sullavan sitting close and looking into each other's eyes]]As a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, [[Margaret Sullavan]] had a unique influence on Stewart's life. They had met while they were both performing for the University Players; he was smitten with her and invited her on a date.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|pp=23, 97, 105–6}} She regarded him as just a close friend and co-worker, and they never began a romantic relationship, but Stewart regardless felt unrequited romantic love towards her for many years.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|pp=82–83}} Though Sullavan was always aware of his feelings, he never directly revealed them to her.{{sfn|Quirk|1986|pp=25, 61}} Sullavan loved Stewart but was never interested in him romantically; rather, she felt protective and maternal.{{sfn|Quirk|1986|pp=61–63}} However, the director of ''The Shopworn Angel'', [[H.C. Potter]] suggested that they may have married each other had Stewart been more forthcoming with his feelings.{{sfn|Quirk|1986|p=93}} She became his acting mentor in Hollywood and according to director [[Edward H. Griffith]], "made [him] a star"; they went on to co-star in four films: ''Next Time You Love'' (1936), ''The Shopworn Angel'' (1938), ''The Shop Around the Corner'' (1940) and ''Mortal Storm'' (1940).{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=83}}

Stewart did not marry until his forties, which attracted a significant amount of contemporary media attention; gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] called him the "Great American Bachelor."{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=232}} Regardless, he had several romantic relationships prior to marriage. After being introduced by Henry Fonda, Stewart and Ginger Rogers had a brief relationship in 1935.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|p=74}} During production of ''The Shopworn Angel'' (1938), Stewart dated actress [[Norma Shearer]] for six weeks.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=110}} Afterward, he dated [[Loretta Young]]; she wanted to settle down but Stewart did not, and their relationship ended when Young's other boyfriend proposed to her.{{Sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=130}} While filming ''Destry Rides Again'' (1939), Stewart had an affair with his co-star Marlene Dietrich, who was married at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=130, 136–138}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Dietrich allegedly became pregnant, but it was quickly terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2017|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Fishgall|1997|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart ended their relationship after the filming was completed. Hurt by Stewart's rejection, she barely mentioned him in her memoir and waved him off as a one-time affair.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=130, 136–138}}

He dated [[Olivia de Havilland]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s and even proposed marriage to her, but she rejected the proposal as she believed he was not ready to settle down.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=138}} She ended the relationship shortly before he began his military service, as she had fallen in love with director [[John Huston]].{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=148}} In 1942, while serving in the military, Stewart met singer [[Dinah Shore]] at the [[Hollywood Canteen]], a club mainly for servicemen. They began a romantic relationship and were nearly married in [[Las Vegas]] in 1943, but Stewart called off the marriage before they arrived, citing cold feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=180–181}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|pp=23, 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Stewart began a relationship with co-star [[Myrna Dell]] during the filming of ''The Stratton Story'' (1949). Although gossip columnists made claims that they were planning to marry, Dell said this was not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=231}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|pp=293–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gloria Hatrick McLean and her family, August 1954.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart with his wife [[Gloria Hatrick McLean|Gloria]] and their children in 1954]]
Stewart's first interaction with his future wife, [[Gloria Hatrick McLean]], was at [[Keenan Wynn]]'s Christmas party in 1947. He had crashed the party and became inebriated, leaving a poor impression of himself with Hatrick.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=231–233}} A year later, [[Gary Cooper]] and his wife Veronica invited Hatrick and Stewart to a dinner party, and the two began dating.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=232–233}} A former model, Hatrick was divorced with two children.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=233–234}} Stewart and Hatrick were married at Brentwood Presbyterian Church on August 9, 1949, and remained married until her death from lung cancer in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=243}}; {{harvnb|Dewey|1996|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendships, interests, and character===
Stewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended to avoid the emotional connection in interviews he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=160}} He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people. Director John Ford said of Stewart, "You don't get to know Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Stewart gets to know you."{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=7}}

[[File:JamesStewart1981.jpg|thumb|upright|Speaking at [[The Kennedy Center]] on Inauguration Day, 1981, in Washington D.C.|alt=An elderly Stewart standing in a tuxedo on a stage, holding a microphone]]
Stewart was a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] throughout his life.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=424}} A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight with [[Henry Fonda]], according to some accounts, but the two maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again.{{sfn|Robbins|1985|p=99}} The fistfight may be apocryphal, as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying, "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other. We just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him⁠—ever!"{{sfn|Robbins|1985|p=99}}

According to biographer Scott Eyman, Stewart was an instinctive actor. He was natural and at ease in front of the camera, despite his shy off-screen personality.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|pp=4, 53}} In line with his natural and conversational acting style, Stewart's costars found him easy to work with, as he was willing to improvise around any situation that arose while filming.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=272}} Later in his career, Stewart began to resent his reputation of having a "natural" acting technique. He asserted that there wasn't anything natural about standing on a sound stage in front of lights and cameras while acting out a scene.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=246}}

Stewart had established early in his career that he was proficient at communicating personality and character nuances through his performances alone.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=60}} He used an "inside-out" acting technique, preferring to represent the character without accents, makeup, and props.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=174}} Additionally, he tended to act with his body, not only with his voice and face; for example, in ''Harvey'', Stewart portrays the main character's age and loneliness by slightly hunching down.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=202}} He was also known for his pauses that had the ability to hold the audience's attention. Film critic [[Geoffrey O'Brien]] related that Stewart's "stammering pauses" created anxious space for the audience, leaving them in anticipation for the scene which Stewart took his time leading up to.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=212}}

Stewart himself claimed to dislike his earlier film performances, saying he was "all hands and feet", yet added that he "didn't seem to know what to do with either".{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=66}} He added that even though he did not always like his performances, he would not get discouraged. He said, "But I always tried, and if the script wasn't too good, well, then, I just tried a little bit harder. I hope, though, not so hard that it shows."{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=259}} Former co-star Kim Novak stated of his acting style that for emotional scenes, he would access emotions deep inside of him and would take time to wind down after the scene ended. He could not turn it off immediately after the director yelled cut.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=211}}

Stewart was particularly adept at performing vulnerable scenes with women. [[Jack Lemmon]] suggested that Stewart's talent for performing with women was that he was able to allow the audience to see the respect and gentility he felt toward the women through his eyes. He showed that his characters needed them as much as their characters needed him.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=493}} In connection to Stewart's screen persona with women, [[Peter Bradshaw]] said ''The Philadelphia Story'' is "a film every school pupil should see" due to Stewart's character's clear explanation of sexual consent after being accused of taking advantage of the main female character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Peter |title=Porn in schools?

Stewart's screen persona was that of an "everyman", an ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances. Audiences could identify with him, in contrast to other Hollywood leading men of the time, such as Cary Grant, who represented what the audience wanted to become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glenn |first1=Colleen |title=Complicating the theory of the male gaze: Hitchcock's leading men |journal=New Review of Film and Television Studies |date=2017 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=496–510 |doi=10.1080/17400309.2017.1376892 |s2cid=149307252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's screen persona has been compared to those of Gary Cooper and [[Tom Hanks]].{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=174}} Eyman suggested that Stewart could portray several different characters: "the brother, the sweetheart, [and] the nice guy next door with a bias toward doing the right thing: always decent but never a pushover".{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=65}} In Stewart's early career, [[Louella Parsons]] described his "boyish appeal" and "ability to win audience sympathy" as the reasons for his success as an actor; Stewart's performances appealed to both young and old audiences.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=68}} According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, Stewart's essential persona was, "a small-town friendly neighbor, with a gentle face and voice and a slim body that is at once graceful and awkward."{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=23}} Unlike many actors who developed their on-screen persona over time, Stewart's on-screen persona was recognizable as early as ''Art Trouble'' (1932), his uncredited debut film role, where Stewart was relaxed and comfortable on-screen.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=53}} He portrayed this persona most strongly in the 1940s, but maintained a classic everyman persona throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ricwulf |first1=Daniel |title=The 10 Great Everyman Actors of the Last Century |url=https://screenrant.com/everyman-actors-hollywood/ |access-date=August 27, 2019 |work=Screen Rant |publisher=Valnet |date=September 7, 2016 |archive-date=August 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827204908/https://screenrant.com/everyman-actors-hollywood/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Susan |title=James Stewart: Celebrating his 100th birthday |url=https://www.latimes.com/science/la-gd-movies22-2008may22-story.html |access-date=August 27, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 22, 2008 |archive-date=August 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827211206/https://www.latimes.com/science/la-gd-movies22-2008may22-story.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Adam |title=Is Tom Hanks the most relatable actor ever? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/sully/tom-hanks-most-relatable-actor-ever/ |access-date=August 27, 2019 |work=The Telegraph |date=November 22, 2016 |archive-date=August 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827213914/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/sully/tom-hanks-most-relatable-actor-ever/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickard|1992|pp=10–11}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|1988|pp=7, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film scholar Dennis Bingham wrote that Stewart was "both a 'personality' star and a chameleon" who evoked both masculine and feminine qualities.{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=24}} Consequently, it was difficult for filmmakers to sell Stewart as the stereotypical leading man, and thus he "became a star in films that capitalized on his sexual ambivalence."{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=24}} Stewart's asexual persona as a leading man was unusual for the time period for an actor who was not mainly a comedian.{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=38}} However, during his career "Stewart [encompassed] the furthest extremes of American masculinity, from Reaganite militarist patriotism to Hitchcockian perversity."{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=24}}
[[File:James Stewart Rear Windows Poster Still.jpg|thumb|Stewart as wheelchair-bound news photographer Jeffries in ''Rear Window'' (1954)]]
According to [[Roger Ebert]], Stewart's pre-World War II characters were usually likable, but in postwar years directors chose to cast Stewart in darker roles, such as Jeffries in ''Rear Window''. Ebert put this into contemporary perspective by asking, "What would it feel like to see [Tom Hanks] in a bizarre and twisted light?", explaining that it is jarring to see a beloved everyman persona such as Stewart in dark roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Rear Window |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-rear-window-1954 |website=Rogerebert.com |access-date=November 22, 2019 |archive-date=April 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414012338/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-rear-window-1954 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] explained that since audiences were primarily interested in Stewart's "star persona" and "aura" than his characters, "this makes it more striking when Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock periodically explore the neurotic and obsessive aspects of Stewart's persona to play against his all-American innocence and earnestness."&lt;ref name="movimiento"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenbaum |first1=Jonathan |title=En movimiento: How Do We Judge Actors? |url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2016/08/en-movimiento-how-do-we-judge-actors/ |website=Jonathan Rosenbaum |access-date=December 3, 2019 |archive-date=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203193354/http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2016/08/en-movimiento-how-do-we-judge-actors/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Janet Leigh &amp;amp; James Stewart The Naked Spur Still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Janet Leigh]] and Stewart in Anthony Mann's ''The Naked Spur'' (1953)]]

Film scholar [[John Belton (academic)|John Belton]] argued that rather than playing characters in his films, Stewart often played his own screen persona. He had difficulty playing famous historical personages because his persona could not accommodate the historical character. Belton explained that "James Stewart is more James Stewart than Glenn Miller in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' (1954) or Charles Lindbergh in ''The Spirit of St. Louis'' (1957)."{{sfn|Belton|1994|p=92}} Moreover, Jonathan Rosenbaum continued that Stewart's "pre-existing life-size persona" in ''Winchester '73'' "helped to shape and determine the impact of [his character] in [this film]."&lt;ref name="movimiento" /&gt; 
On the other hand, Stewart has been described as a character actor who went through several distinct career phases.{{sfn|Lloyd|Fuller|Desser|1983|pp=418–419}} According to film scholar Amy Lawrence, the main elements of Stewart's persona, "a propensity for physical and spiritual suffering, lingering fears of inadequacy," were established by Frank Capra in the 1930s and were enhanced through his later work with Hitchcock and Mann.{{sfn|Lawrence|1997|pp=41–42}} John Belton explained that "James Stewart evolves from the naive, small-town, populist hero of Frank Capra's 1930s comedies to the bitter, anxiety-ridden, vengeance-obsessed cowboy in Anthony Mann's 1950s Westerns and the disturbed voyeur and sexual fetishist in Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s suspense thrillers."{{sfn|Belton|1994|p=106}} During his postwar career, Stewart avoided appearing in comedies, ''Harvey'' being the exception. He played many different types of characters, including manipulative, cynical, obsessive, or crazy characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2017|pp=201–202}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart found that acting allowed him to express the fear and anxiety that he could not express during the war; his post-war performances were received well by audiences because audiences could still see the innocent, pre-war Stewart underneath his dark roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2017|pp=210–211}}; {{harvnb|Eliot|2006|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Sarris, Stewart was "the most complete actor-personality in the American cinema."{{sfn|Coe|1994|p=9}}

==Legacy==
[[File:It&amp;#039;s A Wonderful Life.jpg|thumb|Stewart, [[Donna Reed]] and [[Karolyn Grimes]] in ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946)]]
Stewart is remembered for portraying idealist "everyman" characters in his films.{{sfn|Eliot|2006|pp=410–412}}{{sfn|Pomerance|2010|pp=63–64}} His heroism on-screen and devotion to his family made him relatable and representative of the American ideal, leading Stewart to be considered one of the best-loved figures in twentieth-century American popular culture.{{sfn|Gregg|2000|pp=552–554}} According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, "his ability to 'play'—even symbolize—honesty and 'American ideals' made him an icon into whose mold later male stars tried to pour themselves."{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=11}} Similarly, film scholar [[James Naremore]] has called Stewart "the most successful actor of the 'common man' in the history of movies" and "the most intensely-emotional leading man to emerge from the studio system," who could cry on screen without losing his masculinity.{{sfn|Naremore|1988|pp=253–254}} [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] has explained Stewart's appeal by stating that "we wanted to be him, and we wanted to be liked by him,"&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=David |title=The man we love to love |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures9 |access-date=December 3, 2019 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Limited |date=November 21, 2002 |archive-date=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203224130/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures9 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roger Ebert]] has stated that "whether he played everyman, or everyman's hidden psyche, Stewart was an innately likable man whose face, loping gait and distinctive drawl became famous all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=James Stewart, A Tribute |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/james-stewart-a-tribute |website=Rogerebert.com |access-date=November 21, 2019 |archive-date=June 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200619075031/https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/james-stewart-a-tribute |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Stewart's most recognizable qualities was his manner of speaking with a hesitant drawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|2006|pp=150, 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesitant Hero" /&gt; According to film scholar Tim Palmer, "Stewart's legacy rests on his roles as the nervous idealist standing trial for, and gaining stature from, the sincerity of his beliefs, while his emotive convictions are put to the test."{{sfn|Palmer|2009|p=43}} Film critic [[David Ansen]] wrote about Stewart's appeal as a person in addition to his appeal as an actor. Ansen retold a story in which Jack Warner, upon being told about Ronald Reagan's presidential ambitions, said, "No. Jimmy Stewart for president, Ronald Reagan for best friend."&lt;ref name="ansen"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ansen |first1=David |title=The All American Hero |url=https://www.newsweek.com/all-american-hero-174538 |access-date=December 3, 2019 |work=Newsweek |date=July 12, 1997 |archive-date=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203234129/https://www.newsweek.com/all-american-hero-174538 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ansen further explained that Stewart was the ultimate trustworthy movie star.&lt;ref name="ansen" /&gt;

In contrast to his popularly remembered "all-American" screen persona, film critics and scholars have tended to emphasize that his performances also often showed a "dark side."{{sfn|Britton|1984|pp=6–7}} According to film scholar [[Murray Pomerance]], "the other Jimmy Stewart ... was a different type altogether, a repressed and neurotic man buried beneath an apparently calm facade, but ready at any moment to explode with vengeful anxiety and anger, or else with deeply twisted and constrained passions that could never match up with cheery personality of the alter ego."{{sfn|Pomerance|2010|p=64}} Bingham has described him as having "two coequal personas; the earnest idealist, the nostalgic figure of the homespun boy next door; and the risk-taking actor who probably performed in films for more canonical auteurs than any other American star."{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=10}} According to him, it is this complexity and his ambiguous masculinity and sexuality with which he approached his roles that characterized his persona.{{sfn|Bingham|1994|pp=95–96}} Naremore has stated that there was a "troubled, cranky, slightly-repressed feeling in [Stewart's] behavior,"{{sfn|Naremore|1988|p=254}} and Thomson has written that it was his dark side that produced "great cinema."&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt;

Stewart was one of the most sought-after actors in 1950s Hollywood, proving that independent actors could be successful in the film industry, which led more actors in Hollywood to forego studio contracts.{{sfn|Booker|2011|pp=364–365}} According to Bingham, Stewart marked "the transition between the studio period...and the era of free-lance actors, independent production, and powerful talent agents that made possible the "new kind of star" of the late 1960s."{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=10}} Although Stewart was not the first big-name freelance actor, his "mythic sweetness and idealism [which] were combined with eccentric physical equipment and capacity as an actor to enact emotion, anxiety, and pain" enabled him to succeed in both the studio system, which emphasized the star as a real person, and the skeptical post-studio era.{{sfn|Bingham|1994|p=10}}

A number of Stewart's films have become classics of American cinema, with twelve of his films having been inducted into the [[National Film Registry|United States National Film Registry]] as of 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |access-date=June 3, 2019 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191832/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and five —''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939), ''The Philadelphia Story'' (1940), ''It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946), ''Rear Window'' (1954), and ''Vertigo'' (1958)— being featured on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 greatest American films]] of all time.

On May 20, 1995, his 87th birthday, [[The Jimmy Stewart Museum]] was established there.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=207}} The museum is located near his birthplace, his childhood home and the former location of his father's hardware store.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=208}} According to biographer Gary Fishgall, some residents of Indiana were angered by the creation of the museum; they believed he had contributed nothing to the town aside from growing up there. The museum committee insisted that Stewart had contributed significant donations to the town, but it was done quietly so it was unknown to most residents.{{sfn|Fishgall|1997|p=371}} A large statue of Stewart stands on the lawn of the Indiana County Courthouse and a plaque marks his birthplace.{{sfn|Smith|2005|pp=19, 208}} In 2011, the United States Post Office located at 47 South 7th Street in Indiana, Pennsylvania, was designated the "James M.
