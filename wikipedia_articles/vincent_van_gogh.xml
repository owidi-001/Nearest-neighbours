In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 [[oil painting]]s, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include [[Trees and Undergrowth (Van Gogh series)|landscapes]], [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)|still lifes]], [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh|portraits]] and [[Portraits of Vincent van Gogh|self-portraits]], and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive [[paintwork|brushwork]] that contributed to the foundations of [[modern art]]. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at thirty-seven came after years of depression and poverty.

Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man, he worked as an [[art dealer]], often traveling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a [[Protestant]] missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] supported him financially, and the two kept a [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|long correspondence by letter]]. His early works, mostly [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)|still lifes]] and depictions of [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)|peasant labourers]], contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the ''[[avant-garde]]'', including [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], who were reacting against the [[Impressionist]] sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and [[Montmartre (Van Gogh series)|local landscapes]]. His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in [[Arles]] in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|olive trees]], [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat fields]], and [[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|sunflowers]].

Van Gogh suffered from [[Psychosis|psychotic episodes]] and [[delusion]]s and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]]. After he discharged himself and moved to the [[Auberge Ravoux]] in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] near Paris, he came under the care of the [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] doctor [[Paul Gachet]]. His depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a [[Lefaucheux]] revolver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/le-revolver-avec-lequel-van-gogh-se-serait-mortellement-blesse-en-vente-a-paris-20190402 ''Le revolver avec lequel Van Gogh se serait mortellement blessé en vente à Paris''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402211847/http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/le-revolver-avec-lequel-van-gogh-se-serait-mortellement-blesse-en-vente-a-paris-20190402 |date=2 April 2019 }} in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' 2 April 2019&lt;/ref&gt; He died from his injuries two days later.

Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide and exists in the public imagination as a misunderstood genius, "where discourses on madness and creativity converge".{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 9}} His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and [[German Expressionism|German Expressionists]]. He attained widespread critical, commercial, and popular success over the ensuing decades, and he is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the [[tortured artist]]. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the [[List of most expensive paintings|world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold]], and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.

==Letters==
{{See also|The Letters of Vincent van Gogh}}
The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890.{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg "Van Gogh: The Letters"]}} Theo van Gogh was an [[art dealer]] and provided his brother with financial and emotional support as well as access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 19}}

Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him;{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= xv}} Vincent kept a few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]] arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 248}}{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= ix, xv}} Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a "diary-like intimacy",{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 19}} and read in parts like autobiography.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 19}} The translator [[Arnold Pomerans]] wrote that their publication adds a "fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted to us by virtually no other painter".{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= ix}}

There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], 58 to the painter [[Anthon van Rappard]], 22 to [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] as well as individual letters to [[Paul Signac]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and the critic [[Albert Aurier]]. Some are illustrated with [[sketch (drawing)|sketches]].{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 19}} Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from Arles. While there Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French and English.{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=143}} There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= i–xxvi}}

The highly paid contemporary artist [[Jules Breton]] was frequently mentioned in Vincent's letters. In 1875 letters to Theo, Vincent mentions he saw Breton, discusses the Breton paintings he saw at a [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], and discusses sending one of Breton's books but only on the condition that it be returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 9 December 1875|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/3/047.htm|access-date=1 January 2021|website=www.webexhibits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=034 (034, 27): To Theo van Gogh.

He turned around and went back without making his presence known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Route|first=Van Gogh|title=Vincent van Gogh in Borinage, Belgium|url=https://www.vangoghroute.com/belgium/borinage/|access-date=1 January 2021|website=Van Gogh Route|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=hoakley|date=6 April 2017|title=Jules Breton's Eternal Harvest: 4 1877–1889|url=https://eclecticlight.co/2017/04/06/jules-bretons-eternal-harvest-4-1877-1889/|access-date=1 January 2021|website=The Eclectic Light Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AN ARTIST IS BORN|url=http://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/AN-ARTIST-IS-BORN-Vincent-Van-Gogh|access-date=1 January 2021|website=AwesomeStories.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears Breton was unaware of Van Gogh or his attempted visit. There are no known letters between the two artists and Van Gogh is not one of the contemporary artists discussed by Breton in his 1891 autobiography ''Life of an Artist''.

==Life==
{{Main|Vincent van Gogh chronology}}

===Early years===
{{See also|Van Gogh's family in his art}}
Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in [[Zundert|Groot-Zundert]], in the predominantly Catholic province of [[North Brabant]] in the Netherlands.{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= 1}} He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and his wife Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth.{{efn|group=note|It has been suggested that being given the same name as his dead elder brother might have had a deep psychological impact on the young artist, and that elements of his art, such as the portrayal of pairs of male figures, can be traced back to this.{{sfnp|Lubin|1972|loc=82–84}}}} Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family. The name had been borne by his grandfather, the prominent art dealer Vincent (1789–1874), and a theology graduate at the [[University of Leiden]] in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).{{sfnp|Erickson|1998|loc= 9}}

Van Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in [[The Hague]],{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 14–16}} and his father was the youngest son of a minister.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 59}} The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 18}} His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and [[Wil van Gogh|Willemina]] (known as "Wil"). In later life, Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 16}} Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 23–25}} Theodorus's salary was modest, but the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 31–32}}

&lt;!-- [[File:Vincent van Gogh at circa 13 years of age cropped.jpeg|thumb|upright|Vincent {{circa|lk=no|1866}}, about 13 years old|alt=Black-and-white formal head shot photo of the artist as a boy in jacket and tie. He has thick curly hair and very pale-coloured eyes with a wary, uneasy expression.]] Theo, not Vincent –  see Talk page--&gt;
Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 13}} He was taught at home by his mother and a governess and in 1860 was sent to the village school. In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school at [[Zevenbergen]],{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 25–35}} where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866 his parents sent him to the middle school in [[Tilburg]], where he was deeply unhappy.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 45–49}} His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother,{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 36–50}} and his early drawings are expressive,{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 25–35}} but do not approach the intensity of his later work.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc=8–9}} [[Constant Cornelis Huijsmans]], who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 48}} In March 1868, he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was "austere and cold, and sterile".{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let403/letter.html Letter 403]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh, Nieuw-Amsterdam, on or about Monday, 5 November 1883.}}

In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers [[Goupil &amp; Cie]] in The Hague.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 20}} After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch on [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]] and took lodgings at [[87 Hackford Road (Van Gogh)|87 Hackford Road]], [[Stockwell]].{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let007/letter.html Letter 007]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh, The Hague, Monday, 5 May 1873.}} This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work and, at 20, was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and he was dismissed a year later.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 35–47}}

[[File:Cuesmes JPG001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maison Van Gogh|Van Gogh's home in Cuesmes]]; while there he decided to become an artist|alt=Photo of a two-storey brick house on the left partially obscured by trees with a front lawn and with a row of trees on the right]]
In April 1876 he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small [[boarding school]] in [[Ramsgate]]. When the proprietor moved to [[Isleworth]] in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him.{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= xxvii}}{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let088/letter.html Letter 088]|ps= .

To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877 the family sent him to live with his uncle [[Johannes Stricker]], a respected theologian, in Amsterdam.{{refn|{{harvp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 26}}; {{harvp|Erickson|1998|loc= 23.}}}} Van Gogh prepared for the [[University of Amsterdam]] theology entrance examination;{{sfnp|Grant|2014|p= 9}} he failed the exam and left his uncle's house in July 1878. He undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at a [[Protestant]] missionary school in [[Laken]], near Brussels.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1990|loc=60–62, 73}}

In January 1879 he took up a post as a missionary at [[Petit Wasmes|Petit-Wasmes]]{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 101}} in the coal-mining district of [[Borinage]] in Belgium.

Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents.{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= 83}} He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia "Kee" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willemina and [[Johannes Stricker]], arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than he was and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 145}} She refused with the words "No, nay, never" ("''nooit, neen, nimmer''").{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let179/letter.html Letter 179]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh. Etten, Thursday, 3 November 1881.}} After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin, [[Anton Mauve]]. Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 239–240}} Mauve invited him to return in a few months and suggested he spend the intervening time working in [[charcoal (art)|charcoal]] and [[pastel]]s; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this advice.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 239–240}}

Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker, one which he described to Theo as an attack.{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let189/letter.html Letter 189]|ps= .

Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.{{sfnp|Gayford|2006|loc=125}}

Mauve took Van Gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 250–252}} He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague.{{efn|group=note|"At Christmas I had a rather violent argument with Pa, and feelings ran so high that Pa said it would be better if I left home.

By March 1882, Mauve appeared to have gone cold towards Van Gogh, and he stopped replying to his letters.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 96–103}} He had learned of Van Gogh's new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute, [[Sien (Van Gogh series)|Clasina Maria "Sien" Hoornik]] (1850–1904), and her young daughter.{{refn|{{harvp|Callow|1990|loc=116}}; cites the work of Hulsker; {{harvp|Callow|1990|loc= 123–124}}; {{harvp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let224/letter.html Letter 224] |ps= .

She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this.{{refn|{{harvp|Callow|1990|loc=116–117}}. citing the research of [[Jan Hulsker]]; the two dead children were born in 1874 and 1879.}} On 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 107}} When Van Gogh's father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him,{{refn|{{harvp|Callow |1990|loc= 132}}; {{harvp|Tralbaut|1981|loc=102–104, 112}}}} and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883, he left Sien and the children.{{sfnp|Arnold|1992|loc=38}}

Poverty may have pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her daughter to her mother and baby Willem to her brother.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc=113}} Willem remembered visiting [[Rotterdam]] when he was about 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child.{{sfnp|Wilkie|2004|loc=185}} He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 101–107}} Sien drowned herself in the [[Scheldt|River Scheldt]] in 1904.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 111–122}}

In September 1883, Van Gogh moved to [[Drenthe]] in the northern Netherlands. In December, driven by loneliness, he went to live with his parents, then in [[Nuenen]], North Brabant.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 111–122}}

In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)#The weaver|paintings of weavers]] and [[Cottages (Van Gogh series)|their cottages]]. Van Gogh also completed ''[[The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen]]'', which was stolen from the [[Singer Laren]] in March 2020.&lt;ref name="artnet News 2020"&gt;{{cite web | title=Opportunistic Thieves Just Stole a Prized Van Gogh Landscape From a Locked-Down Dutch Museum Under Cover of Night | website=artnet News | date=30 March 2020 | url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/thieves-stolen-van-gogh-masterpiece-dutch-museum-1819743 | access-date=30 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 174}} From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of [[strychnine]], but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 107}} On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 154}}

Van Gogh painted several groups of [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)|still lifes]] in 1885.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc=196–205}} During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguished his later work.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 123–160}}

There was interest from a dealer in Paris early in 1885.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 436}} Theo asked Vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=29}} In May, Van Gogh responded with his first major work, ''[[The Potato Eaters]]'', and a series of "[[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)|peasant character studies]]" which were the culmination of several years of work.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 127}} When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that they were too dark and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 123–160}} In August his work was publicly exhibited for the first time, in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague. One of his [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)#Woman|young peasant sitters]] became pregnant in September 1885; Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her, and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 709}}

He moved to Antwerp that November and rented a room above a paint dealer's shop in the rue des Images (''Lange Beeldekensstraat'').{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=181}} He lived in poverty and ate poorly, preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models. Bread, coffee and [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]] became his staple diet. In February 1886, he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=184}} In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of [[colour theory]] and spent time in museums{{mdash}}particularly studying the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens]]{{mdash}}and broadened his palette to include [[carmine]], [[cobalt blue]] and [[Paris green|emerald green]]. Van Gogh bought Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings.{{sfnp|Hammacher|1985|loc=84}} He was drinking heavily again,{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=253}} and was hospitalised between February and March 1886,{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 477}} when he was possibly also treated for [[syphilis]].{{sfnp|Arnold|1992|loc= 77}}{{efn| group= note |The only evidence for this is from interviews with the grandson of the doctor.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 177–178}} For an overall review see Naifeh and Smith.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc=477 n. 199}}}}

After his recovery, despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Antwerp and, in January 1886, matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 173}} He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with [[Charles Verlat]], the director of the Academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class [[Franz Vinck]]. Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by [[Eugène Siberdt]]. Soon Siberdt and Van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When Van Gogh was required to draw the [[Venus of Milo]] during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to Van Gogh's drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, ''God damn it!'' A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!' According to some accounts, this was the last time Van Gogh attended classes at the Academy and he left later for Paris.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 448–489}} On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the Academy decided that 17 students, including Van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that Van Gogh was expelled from the Academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://janlampo.com/category/romantiek/ Jan Lampo, ''In het Spoor van de Academie – persbericht''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206170104/https://janlampo.com/category/romantiek/ |date=6 February 2017 }} {{in lang|nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo's rue Laval apartment in [[Montmartre]] and studied at [[Fernand Cormon]]'s studio. In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54 [[rue Lepic]].{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 187–192}} In Paris, Vincent painted [[Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin|portraits of friends and acquaintances]], [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)|still life paintings]], views of [[Le Moulin de la Galette (Van Gogh series)|Le Moulin de la Galette]], [[Montmartre (Van Gogh series)|scenes in Montmartre]], [[Asnières (Van Gogh series)|Asnières]] and along the [[Seine (Van Gogh series)|Seine]]. In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|Japonaiserie]], tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine ''Paris Illustre'', ''[[Copies by Vincent van Gogh#Copy after Keisai Eisen|The Courtesan or Oiran]]'' (1887), after [[Keisai Eisen]], which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 38–39}}

After seeing the portrait of [[Adolphe Monticelli]] at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his ''[[Saintes-Maries (Van Gogh series)|Seascape at Saintes-Maries]]'' (1888).{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 135}}{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let853/letter.html Letter 853]|ps= .

Van Gogh learned about [[Fernand Cormon]]'s [[atelier]] from Theo.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 702}} He worked at the studio in April and May 1886,{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}} where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist [[John Peter Russell]], who painted [[Vincent van Gogh (Russell painting)|his portrait]] in 1886.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc=62–63}} Van Gogh also met fellow students [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], [[Louis Anquetin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]&amp;nbsp;– who painted [[Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (1887)|a portrait of him]] in pastel. They met at [[Portrait of Père Tanguy|Julien "Père" Tanguy]]'s paint shop,{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}} (which was, at that time, the only place where [[Paul Cézanne]]'s paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing [[Pointillism]] and [[Neo-impressionism]] for the first time and bringing attention to [[Georges Seurat]] and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 212–213}}

Conflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be "almost unbearable".{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}} By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to [[Asnières-sur-Seine|Asnières]], a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of [[complementary colour]]s – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=29}}{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 710}}

In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1990|loc= 256}} There, Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin.

In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there.

Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=143}} He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an [[art colony]]. The Danish artist [[Christian Mourier-Petersen]] became his companion for two months, and, at first, Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: "The [[Zouave]]s, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world."{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=144}}

The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings and more than 100 drawings and watercolours.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 11}} He was enchanted by the local countryside and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, [[ultramarine]] and [[mauve]]. They include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including ''The Old Mill'' (1888), one of seven canvases sent to [[Pont-Aven]] on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, [[Charles Laval]] and others.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}} 
The portrayals of Arles are informed by his Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues are flat and lacking [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], but excel in their use of colour.{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc=143–144}}

In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded "perspective frame"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]]. In April, he was visited by the American artist [[Dodge MacKnight]], who was living nearby at [[Fontvieille, Bouches-du-Rhône|Fontvieille]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 129}}{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= 348}} On 1 May 1888, for 15 [[French franc|francs]] per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the [[The Yellow House|Yellow House]] at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.{{sfnp|Nemeczek|1999|loc=59–61}}

On 7 May, Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare,{{sfnp|Gayford|2006|loc=16}} having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and [[L'Arlésienne (painting)|Marie Ginoux]]. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=219}} He wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included ''[[Van Gogh's Chair]]'' (1888), ''[[Bedroom in Arles]]'' (1888), ''[[The Night Café]]'' (1888), ''[[Café Terrace at Night]]'' (September 1888), ''[[Starry Night Over the Rhone]]'' (1888), and ''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers]]'' (1888), all intended for the [[décoration for the Yellow House|decoration for the Yellow House]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 175–176}}

Van Gogh wrote that with ''The Night Café'' he tried "to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime".{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 266}} When he visited [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]] in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – [[Portrait of Paul-Eugène Milliet#The Lover: Paul-Eugène Milliet|Paul-Eugène Milliet]]{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= 356, 360}} – and painted [[Saintes-Maries (Van Gogh series)|boats on the sea and the village]].{{refn|[http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0028V1962 "Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, 1888"].

When Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888, Van Gogh hoped for friendship and the realisation of his idea of an artists' collective. While waiting, in August he painted ''[[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|Sunflowers]]''. When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study ''The Poet Against a Starry Sky.''{{refn|{{harvp|Hulsker|1980|loc= 356}}; {{harvp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 168–169, 206.}}}}{{efn|group=note| Boch's sister [[Anna Boch|Anna]] (1848–1936), also an artist, purchased ''[[The Red Vineyard]]'' in 1890.{{refn|{{harvp|Hulsker|1980|loc= 356}}; {{harvp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 168–169, 206.}}}}}}

In preparation for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station's postal supervisor [[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|Joseph Roulin]], whose portrait he painted. On 17 September, he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House.{{refn|{{harvp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let677/letter.html Letter 677] |ps= .

Arles, Sunday, 16 September 1888; {{harvp|Gayford |2006|loc= 18}}; {{harvp|Nemeczek|1999|loc=61.}}}} When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on the ''[[Décoration for the Yellow House]],'' probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook.{{sfnp|Dorn |1990}} He completed two chair paintings: ''Van Gogh's Chair'' and ''Gauguin's Chair.''{{sfnp|Pickvance |1984|loc=  234–235}}

After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October and, in November, the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his ''[[The Painter of Sunflowers]]''; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin's suggestion. Among these "imaginative" paintings is ''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden at Etten]]''.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc= 374–376}}{{efn|group=note|{{harvp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let719/letter.html Letter 719]|ps= &amp;nbsp;Vincent to Theo van Gogh.

Gauguin gives me courage to imagine, and the things of the imagination do indeed take on a more mysterious character.{{paragraph break}}}}}} Their first joint outdoor venture was at the [[Alyscamps]], when they produced the pendants ''[[Les Alyscamps]]''.{{sfnp|Gayford|2006|loc=61}} The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was his portrait of Van Gogh.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 411}}

Van Gogh and Gauguin visited [[Montpellier]] in December 1888, where they saw works by [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] in the [[Musée Fabre]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 195}} Their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of "excessive tension", rapidly headed towards crisis point.{{sfnp|Gayford |2006|loc= 274–277}}

[[File:Felix Rey portrait &amp; sketch.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Félix Rey'', January 1889, [[Pushkin Museum]]; note written by Dr Rey for novelist [[Irving Stone]] with sketches of the damage to van Gogh's ear]]
The exact sequence of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known. Gauguin stated, 15 years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc=66}} Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially.{{sfnp|Druick|Zegers|2001|loc= 266}} It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave.{{sfnp|Druick|Zegers|2001|loc= 266}} The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 290}} Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left the house for a walk, and "rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand".{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 290}} This account is uncorroborated;{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 1}} Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 290}}

After the altercation with Gauguin, in the evening of 23 December 1888&lt;ref name="berkeley" /&gt; Van Gogh returned to his room, where he was assaulted by [[auditory hallucination|voices]] and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ),{{efn|group=note|Theo and his wife, Gachet and his son, and Signac, who all saw Van Gogh after the bandages were removed, maintained that only the [[earlobe]] had been removed.{{sfnp| Rewald|1978|loc= 243–248}} According to Doiteau and Leroy, the diagonal cut removed the lobe and probably a little more.{{sfnp|Doiteau|Leroy|1928}} The policeman and Rey both claimed Van Gogh severed the entire [[auricle (anatomy)|outer ear]];{{sfnp| Rewald|1978|loc= 243–248}} Rey repeated his account in 1930, writing a note for novelist [[Irving Stone]] and including a sketch of the line of the incision.&lt;ref name="artnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-how-one-art-history-teacher-solved-two-of-the-biggest-mysteries-about-van-gogh|title=How One Art History Teacher Solved Two of the Biggest Mysteries about Van Gogh|last=Cain|first=Abigail|date=26 July 2016|website=artsy.net|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221224047/https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-how-one-art-history-teacher-solved-two-of-the-biggest-mysteries-about-van-gogh|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} causing severe bleeding.{{sfnp| Rewald|1978|loc= 243–248}} He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented.{{sfnp| Rewald|1978|loc= 243–248}} Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital,{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 235}}{{sfnp|Gayford|2006|loc=277}} where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 290}} Van Gogh researcher and art historian, Bernadette Murphy, discovered the true identity of the woman named Gabrielle who died in Arles at age 80 in 1952; and whose descendants still live just outside Arles. Gabrielle, known in her youth as "Gaby", was a 17-year-old cleaning girl at the brothel and other local establishments at the time Van Gogh presented her with his ear.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.lib.berkeley.edu/van-Gogh-ear|title=What actually happened to Vincent van Gogh's ear?

Van Gogh had no recollection of the event, suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc=707–708}} The hospital diagnosis was "acute mania with generalised delirium",{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 249}} and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care.{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/documentation.html Concordance, lists, bibliography: Documentation]}}{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 237}} Gauguin immediately notified Theo, who on 24 December had proposed marriage to his old friend [[Andries Bonger]]'s sister Johanna.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 37}} That evening Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles. He arrived on Christmas Day and comforted Vincent, who seemed to be semi-lucid. That evening he left Arles for the return trip to Paris.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 704–705}}

During the first days of his treatment, Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to "be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him."{{sfnp|Gayford|2006|loc=284}} Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Meanwhile, other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.{{sfnp|Pickvance |1986|loc=62}}

Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 713}} He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and [[delusion]]s of poisoning.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 298–300}} In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as "le fou roux" (''the redheaded madman'');{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/documentation.html Concordance, lists, bibliography: Documentation]}} Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March;{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 300}} in April Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home.{{refn|{{harvp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 239–242}}; {{harvp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 265–273.}}}} Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]. Around this time, he wrote, "Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant."{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc= 145}}

Van Gogh gave his 1889 ''Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey'' to Dr Rey. The physician was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop, then gave it away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/gun-used-by-vincent-van-gogh-to-kill-himself-goes-on-display-1.2719415|title=Gun used by Vincent van Gogh to kill himself goes on display|last=Cluskey|first=Peter|date=12 July 2016|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023053859/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/gun-used-by-vincent-van-gogh-to-kill-himself-goes-on-display-1.2719415|archive-date=23 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the portrait was housed at the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]] and estimated to be worth over $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vangoghstudio.com/portrait-of-doctor-felix-rey/|title=Portrait of Doctor Felix Rey Oil Painting Reproduction, 1889|website=van gogh studio|language=nl-NL|access-date=22 October 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023061312/http://www.vangoghstudio.com/portrait-of-doctor-felix-rey/|archive-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the centre of the sky the Milky Way is represented as a double swirling vortex.|''[[The Starry Night]]'', June 1889. [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
Van Gogh entered the [[Monastery of Saint-Paul de Mausole|Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum]] on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his caregiver, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than {{convert|30|km|mi}} from Arles, and it was run by a former naval doctor, [[Théophile Peyron]]. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio.{{sfnp|Callow|1990|loc=246}} The clinic and [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)#The garden|its garden]] became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as ''Vestibule of the Asylum'' and ''Saint-Rémy (September 1889)'', and its gardens, such as ''[[Lilacs (painting)|Lilacs]]'' (May 1889). Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as ''[[The Starry Night]]''. He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted [[Cupressus|cypresses]] and olive trees, including ''[[Valley with Ploughman Seen from Above]]'', [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|''Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889,'']] ''[[Cypresses (Metropolitan Museum of Art)|Cypresses 1889]],'' ''Cornfield with Cypresses'' (1889), ''Country road in Provence by Night'' (1890). In September 1889 he produced two further versions of ''Bedroom in Arles''.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 102–103}}

Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh instead worked on [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|interpretations of other artist's paintings]], such as [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s ''The Sower'' and ''Noonday Rest'', and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the [[Realism (visual art)|Realism]] of [[Jules Breton]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and Millet,{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=23}} and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 154–157}}

His ''[[Prisoners' Round (after Gustave Doré)]]'' (1890) was painted after an [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Doré]] (1832–1883). Tralbaut suggests that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself;{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 286}} [[Jan Hulsker]] discounts this.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1990|loc=434}}

Between February and April 1890, Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse. Depressed and unable to bring himself to write, he was still able to paint and draw a little during this time,{{sfnp|Hulsker|1990|loc= 440}} and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases "from memory&amp;nbsp;... [[Houses at Auvers#"Reminisces of the North"|reminisces of the North]]".{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let863/letter.html letter 863]|ps= . Theo van Gogh to Vincent, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, Tuesday, 29 April 1890.}} Among these was ''Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset''. Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh's illness had a significant effect on his work.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1990|loc= 390, 404}} Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches.{{sfnp| Rewald|1978|loc= 326–329}} Belonging to this period is ''[[At Eternity's Gate|Sorrowing Old Man ("At Eternity's Gate")]]'', a colour study Hulsker describes as "another unmistakable remembrance of times long past".{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 820}}{{refn|{{harvp|Hulsker|1990|loc= 390, 404}}; {{harvp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 287.}}}} His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, according to the art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], "longing for concision and grace".{{sfnp|Hughes|1990|loc= 144}}

After the birth of his nephew, Van Gogh wrote, "I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of [[Almond Blossoms|white almond blossom]] against a blue sky."{{sfnp|Tralbaut|1981|loc= 293}}

[[Albert Aurier]] praised his work in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in January 1890 and described him as "a genius".{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc=Appendix III, 310–315|ps = . Aurier's original 1890 review in French with parallel English translation.}} In February, Van Gogh painted five versions of ''[[L'Arlésienne (painting)|L'Arlésienne]] (Madame Ginoux)'', based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc=175–177}}{{efn|group=note|The version intended for Ginoux is lost.

At the opening dinner a ''Les XX'' member, [[Henry de Groux]], insulted Van Gogh's work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group.

From 20 March to 27 April 1890, Van Gogh was included in the sixth exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in the Pavillon de la Ville de Paris on the Champs-Elysées. Van Gogh exhibited ten paintings. Eight of these can be identified as ''Cypresses'' (F 613 / JH 1746 ), ''Road menders (‘The tall plane trees’)'' (F 657 / JH 1860 ), ''Ravine'' (F 662 / JH 1804 ), ''Avenue of chestnut trees in blossom'' (F 517 / JH 1689 ), ''Mulberry tree'' (F 637 / JH 1796 ), ''Trees with ivy in the garden of the asylum'' (F 609 / JH 1693 ), ''Wheatfield at sunrise'' (F 737 / JH 1862 ). ‘Les Tournesols’ is either ''Sunflowers in a vase'' (F 454 / JH 1562 ) or ''Sunflowers in a vase'' (F 456 / JH 1561 ) ''Wheatfield after a storm'' (F 611 / JH 1723 ) and ''Olive grove'' (F 586 / JH 1854 ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=854 (855, 626): To Theo van Gogh.

In May 1890, Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both [[Paul Gachet|Dr Paul Gachet]] in the Paris suburb of [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – [[Camille Pissarro]] had recommended him. Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was "iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much."{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/RM20/letter.html Letter RM20]|ps= .

The painter [[Charles-François Daubigny|Charles Daubigny]] moved to Auvers in 1861 and in turn drew other artists there, including [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] and [[Honoré Daumier]]. In July 1890, Van Gogh completed two paintings of ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]'', one of which is likely his final work.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 270–271}}

In July, Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed "in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow".{{sfnp|Edwards|1989|loc=115}} He had first become captivated by the fields in May, when the wheat was young and green.

Research published in 2020 by senior researchers at the museum Louis van Tilborgh and Teio Meedendorp, reviewing findings of Wouter van der Veen, the scientific director of the Institut Van Gogh, concluded that it was "highly plausible" that the exact location where Van Gogh's final work ''[[Tree Roots]]'' was some {{convert|150|m}} from the Auberge Ravoux inn where he was staying, where a stand of trees with a tangle of gnarled roots grew on a hillside. These trees with gnarled roots are shown in a postcard from 1900 to 1910.

On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a 7mm [[Casimir Lefaucheux|Lefaucheux]] [[Pinfire cartridge|pinfire]] [[revolver]].{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 342–343}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jul/12/vincent-van-gogh-truth-about-ear-exhibition-on-verge-of-insanity-amsterdam|title=The whole truth about Van Gogh's ear, and why his 'mad genius' is a myth|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=12 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013141704/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jul/12/vincent-van-gogh-truth-about-ear-exhibition-on-verge-of-insanity-amsterdam|archive-date=13 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no witnesses and he died 30 hours after the incident.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 669}} The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the [[Auberge Ravoux]], where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: "The sadness will last forever".{{refn|{{harvp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 342–343}}; {{harvp|Hulsker|1980|loc=480–483.}}}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5703399s "La misère ne finira jamais", Études, 1947, p. 9] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122024925/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5703399s |date=22 November 2016 }}, Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Philosophie, histoire, sciences de l'homme, D-33939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La tristesse durera toujours", François-Bernard Michel, ''La face humaine de Vincent Van Gogh'', Grasset, 3 November 1999, {{ISBN|978-2-246-58959-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TvGletter"&gt;{{cite web |first= Theodorus |last1= van Gogh |title= Letter from Theo van Gogh to Elisabeth van Gogh Paris, 5 August 1890 |publisher= Webexhibits.org |access-date= 28 April 2015 |url= http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/21/etc-Theo-Lies.htm |quote= he said, "La tristesse durera toujours" [The sadness will last forever] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624060011/http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/21/etc-Theo-Lies.htm |archive-date= 24 June 2011 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh, [[Andries Bonger]], [[Charles Laval]], [[Lucien Pissarro]], Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet, among twenty family members, friends and locals. Theo had been ill, and his health began to decline further after his brother's death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at [[Den Dolder]] and was buried in Utrecht.{{refn|{{harvp|Hayden|2003|loc=152}}; {{harvp|Van der Veen|Knapp|2010|loc=260–264.}}}} In 1914, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]] had Theo's body [[exhumation|exhumed]] and moved from Utrecht to be re-buried alongside Vincent's at Auvers-sur-Oise.{{sfnp|Sweetman|1990|loc= 367}}

There have been numerous debates as to the nature of [[Vincent van Gogh's health|Van Gogh's illness]] and its effect on his work, and many [[retrospective diagnosis|retrospective diagnoses]] have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning.{{sfnp|Arnold|2004}} Perry was the first to suggest [[bipolar disorder]] in 1947,{{sfnp|Perry|1947}} and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer.{{sfnp|Hemphill|1961}}{{sfnp|Blumer|2002}} Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with [[acute intermittent porphyria]], noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious.{{sfnp|Arnold|2004}} [[Temporal lobe epilepsy]] with bouts of depression has also been suggested.{{sfnp|Blumer|2002}} Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.{{sfnp|Blumer|2002}}

The gun Van Gogh was reputed to have used was rediscovered in 1965 and was auctioned, on 19 June 2019, as "the most famous weapon in art history".

Van Gogh drew, and painted with [[watercolour painting|watercolours]] while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged.{{sfnp|Van Heugten|1996|loc= 246–251}} When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures&amp;nbsp;– highly elaborate studies in black and white,{{efn|group=note|Artists working in black and white, e.g. for illustrated papers like ''[[The Graphic]]'' or ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' were among Van Gogh's favourites.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1974}}}} which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.{{sfnp|Dorn|Keyes|2000}}

In August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working ''[[en plein air]]''. Vincent wrote that he could now "go on painting with new vigour".{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let253/letter.html Letter 253]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh. The Hague, Saturday, 5 August 1882.}} From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known [[Hague School]] artists like [[Johan Hendrik Weissenbruch|Weissenbruch]] and [[Bernard Blommers|Blommers]], and he received technical advice from them as well as from painters like [[Théophile de Bock|De Bock]] and [[Herman Johannes van der Weele|Van der Weele]], both of the Hague School's second generation.{{sfnp|Dorn|Schröder|Sillevis|1996}} When he moved to Nuenen after the period in Drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them. ''The Potato Eaters'' and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived.{{sfnp|Dorn|Schröder|Sillevis|1996}} Following a visit to the [[Rijksmuseum]], Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick, economical brushwork of the [[Dutch Masters]], especially [[Rembrandt]] and [[Frans Hals]].{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let535/letter.html Letter 535]|ps= To Theo van Gogh. Nuenen, on or about Tuesday, 13 October 1885.}}{{efn|group=note|{{harvp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let535/letter.html Letter 535 ]|ps= To Theo van Gogh. Nuenen, on or about Tuesday, 13 October 1885:{{paragraph break}}What particularly struck me when I saw the old Dutch paintings again is that they were usually painted quickly. That these great masters like Hals, Rembrandt, [[Jacob van Ruisdael|Ruisdael]]&amp;nbsp;– so many others&amp;nbsp;– as far as possible just put it straight down&amp;nbsp;– and didn't come back to it so very much. And&amp;nbsp;– this, too, please&amp;nbsp;– that if it worked, they left it alone. Above all I admired hands by Rembrandt and Hals&amp;nbsp;– hands that lived, but were not finished in the sense that people want to enforce nowadays&amp;nbsp;... In the winter I'm going to explore various things regarding manner that I noticed in the old paintings. I saw a great deal that I needed. But this above all things&amp;nbsp;– what they call&amp;nbsp;– dashing off&amp;nbsp;– you see that's what the old Dutch painters did famously. That&amp;nbsp;– dashing off&amp;nbsp;– with a few brushstrokes, they won't hear of it now &amp;nbsp;– but how true the results are.{{paragraph break}}}}}} He was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise,{{sfnp|Dorn|Schröder|Sillevis|1996}} so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skills.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 708}}

Theo criticised ''The Potato Eaters'' for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=18}} During Van Gogh's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His ''[[Portrait of Père Tanguy]]'' (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette and is evidence of an evolving personal style.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=18–19}} [[Charles Blanc]]'s treatise on colour interested him greatly and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that "colour expresses something in itself".{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=666}}{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let537/letter.html Letter 537]|ps= . Vincent to Theo, Nuenen, on or about Wednesday, 28 October 1885.}} According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a "psychological and moral weight", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of ''[[The Night Café]]'', a work he wanted to "express the terrible passions of humanity".{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 7}} Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 11}}

Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature,{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 232}} and during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=20}} His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 8–9}} His renditions of the sower, at first copied from [[Jean-François Millet]], reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun.{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=668}} These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 236}} His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian [[iconography]] he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 12}} In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint ''The Sower''.{{sfnp|Sund|1988|loc=666}}

[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 098.jpg|thumb|''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden at Etten]]'', 1888.

Behind them is a young woman who is picking flowers in a large bed of wildflowers. They appear to be walking through a garden on a winding path at the edge of a river.]]
Van Gogh stayed within what he called the "guise of reality",{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 223}} and was critical of overly stylised works.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=21}} He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of ''Starry Night'' had gone too far and that reality had "receded too far in the background".{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=21}} Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Great Wave]]'', the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below, and the painter's vision is "translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint".{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 8}}

Between 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an ''oeuvre'',{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 224}} a collection that reflected his personal vision and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word "purposeful" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=16–17}} He painted many series of studies;{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 223}} most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 242}} The work in Arles contributed considerably to his ''oeuvre'': those he thought the most important from that time were ''The Sower'', ''Night Cafe'', ''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden in Etten]]'' and ''Starry Night''. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=21}}

[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York|alt=A well-dressed woman sits facing to her right (the viewer's left). She has two books on her lap, and is dressed in dark clothes vividly contrasted against a yellow background.]]

Van Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc=138}} Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 193}}

In December 1888 he painted ''La Berceuse'' – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=21}} It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December.

====Self-portraits====
{{main|Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh}}
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project (454045).jpg|alt= A portrait of Vincent van Gogh from the left, with an extreme intense, intent look, and a red beard.|thumb|190x190px|''Self-Portrait'', September 1887. [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 15}}{{efn|group=note|[[Rembrandt]] is one of the few major painters to exceed this volume of self-portraits, producing over 50, but he did so over a forty-year period.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 15}}}} They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc=263–269, 653}} Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.{{sfnp|van Uitert|1981|loc= 242}}{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 261}}

The self-portraits reflect an unusually high degree of self-scrutiny.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 10}} Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life; for example, the mid-1887 Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and Signac.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 265–269}} In ''Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat'', heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas. It is one of his most renowned self-portraits of that period, "with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes, and the novel halo derived from the Neo-impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a 'purposeful' canvas".{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=83}}

They contain a wide array of [[Physiognomy|physiognomical]] representations.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 15}} Van Gogh's mental and physical condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 15}}

Van Gogh's gaze is seldom directed at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin.{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 261}} Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 15}} Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 535–537}}{{sfnp|Cohen|2003|loc=305–306}}

====Flowers====

[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 127.jpg|thumb|upright|''Still Life: Vase with Fourteen Sunflowers'', August 1888. [[National Gallery]], London|alt=A ceramic vase with sunflowers on a yellow surface against a bright yellow background.]]
Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, [[lilac]]s, [[iris (plant)|irises]], and [[sunflower]]s. Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese [[ukiyo-e]].{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 80–81, 184–187}} There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 413}} Both are built from [[impasto|thickly layered paintwork]], which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the "texture of the seed-heads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-sunflowers|title=Vincent van Gogh; Sunflowers; NG3863|publisher=National Gallery, London|access-date=1 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812154012/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-sunflowers|archive-date=12 August 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather, the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin,{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 411}} who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888: "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers&amp;nbsp;... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go."{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let666/letter.html Letter 666]|ps= . Vincent to Theo van Gogh. Arles, Tuesday, 21 or Wednesday, 22 August 1888.}}

The sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the ''[[Décoration for the Yellow House|Yellow House's guest room]]'' in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 411}} After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the ''Berceuse Triptych'', and included them in his [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|''Les XX'' in Brussels exhibit]]. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 417}}

Fifteen canvases depict [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypresses]], a tree he became fascinated with in Arles.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 101, 189–191}} He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death.{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 8–9}} The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 110}} Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: "Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers"; he went on to say, "They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk."{{sfnp|Rewald|1978|loc= 311}}

In mid-1889, and at his sister Wil's request, Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of ''[[Wheat Field with Cypresses]]''.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 132–133}} The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include ''The Starry Night'', in which cypresses dominate the foreground.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 101, 189–191}} In addition to this, other notable works on cypresses include ''Cypresses'' (1889), ''Cypresses with Two Figures'' (1889–90), and ''[[Road with Cypress and Star]]'' (1890).{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 101}}

During the last six or seven months of the year 1889, he had also created at least fifteen paintings of olive trees, a subject which he considered as demanding and compelling.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg84/gg84-46627.html |title=The Olive Garden, 1889 |year=2011 |work=Collection |publisher=National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC |access-date=25 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510143650/http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg84/gg84-46627.html |archive-date=10 May 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these works are ''[[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background]]'' (1889), about which in a letter to his brother Van Gogh wrote, "At last I have a landscape with olives".{{sfnp|Pickvance|1986|loc= 101}}While in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh spent time outside the asylum, where he painted trees in the olive groves. In these works, natural life is rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world, which are, according to Hughes, filled with "a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation".{{sfnp|Hughes|2002|loc= 8–9}}

====Orchards====
{{See also|Flowering Orchards}}

The ''[[Flowering Orchards]]'' (also the ''Orchards in Blossom'') are among the first groups of work completed after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found "a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese".{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 331–333}} Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and "one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled".{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc=45–53}}

During this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 331–333}} Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including ''[[View of Arles, Flowering Orchards]]''.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc=385}} Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the [[Mediterranean climate]] his palette significantly brightened.{{sfnp|Fell |1997|loc= 32}}

Van Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including ''The Old Mill'' (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond.{{sfnp|Pickvance|1984|loc= 177}} At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in ''[[The Wheat Field]]'' series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.{{sfnp|Hulsker|1980|loc=390–394}}

Many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of Van Gogh's death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns.{{sfnp|van Uitert|van Tilborgh|van Heugten|1990|loc=283}}{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 680–686}} Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed "in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow".{{sfnp|Edwards|1989|loc=115}}

Van Gogh was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. His ''Wheatfields at Auvers with White House'' shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues, which creates a sense of idyllic harmony.{{sfnp|Walther|Metzger|1994|loc= 654}}

About 10 July 1890, Van Gogh wrote to Theo of "vast fields of wheat under troubled skies".{{refn|{{harvp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let898/letter.html Letter 898]|ps= .

After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at ''[[Les XX]]''; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc=72}} In 1892, [[Octave Mirbeau]] wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an "infinitely sadder loss for art&amp;nbsp;... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived."{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 305}}

Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent's most vocal and well-connected champion.{{sfnp|Sund|2002|loc= 310}} Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband or her brother-in-law very long and who suddenly had to take care of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 244–254}}{{efn|group=note|Her husband had been the sole support of the family, and Johanna was left with only an apartment in Paris, a few items of furniture, and her brother-in-law's paintings, which at the time were "looked upon as having no value at all".{{sfnp|Van Gogh|2009|loc=[http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/memoir/nephew/1.html Memoirs of V.W.

In 1892, Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh's paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894, the [[Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel Gallery]] in Paris agreed to take 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 245}} In 1896, the [[Fauvism|Fauvist painter]] [[Henri Matisse]], then an unknown art student, visited [[John Russell (Australian painter)|John Russell]] on [[Belle Île]] off Brittany.{{sfnp| Spurling|1998|loc= 119–138}}&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm|title=The Unknown Matisse&amp;nbsp;... – Book Talk|last=interview with [[Hilary Spurling]]|date=8 June 2005|work=[[ABC Online]]|access-date=1 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012112023/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm|archive-date=12 October 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell had been a close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing.

In Paris in 1901, a large Van Gogh retrospective was held at the [[Bernheim-Jeune]] Gallery, which excited [[André Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 245}} Important group exhibitions took place with the [[Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Künstler|Sonderbund]] artists in Cologne in 1912, the [[Armory Show]], New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914.{{sfnp|Dorn|Leeman|1990}} [[Henk Bremmer]] was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh,{{sfnp|Rovers|2007|loc= 262}} and introduced [[Helene Kröller-Müller]] to Van Gogh's art; she became an avid collector of his work.{{sfnp|Rovers|2007|loc= 258}} The early figures in [[German Expressionism]] such as [[Emil Nolde]] acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh's work.{{sfnp|Selz|1968|p= 82}} Bremmer assisted [[Jacob Baart de&amp;nbsp;la&amp;nbsp;Faille]], whose ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' ''L'Oeuvre de Vincent van Gogh'' appeared in 1928.{{refn|{{harvp|Faille|1928}}; {{cite web|title=Faille, J-B de la|url=http://arthistorians.info/faillej|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|access-date=3 August 2016}}}}{{efn|group=note|In de&amp;nbsp;la&amp;nbsp;Faille's 1928 catalogue each of Van Gogh's works was assigned a number.

Van Gogh's fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before [[World War I]],{{sfnp|Weikop|2007|loc= 208}} helped by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914.{{sfnp|Naifeh|Smith|2011|loc= 867}} His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind.{{sfnp|McQuillan|1989|loc= 19}} These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young.{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= x}} In 1934, the novelist [[Irving Stone]] wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled ''[[Lust for Life (novel)|Lust for Life]]'', based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0994883/|title=IMDb for Vincent Van Gogh|access-date=9 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527102007/https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0994883/|archive-date=27 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel and the [[Lust for Life (1956 film)|1956 film]] further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people had heard of Van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.{{sfnp|Pomerans|1997|loc= xii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlhn_Kxgm8g |title=Irving Stone interview |work=[[Day at Night]] |author=[[James Day (journalist)|James Day]] |date=23 April 1974 |access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh's ''The Painter on the Road to Tarascon'', the original of which was destroyed during the [[Second World War]]. Bacon was inspired by an image he described as "haunting", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: "[R]eal painters do not paint things as they are&amp;nbsp;... [T]hey paint them as ''they themselves'' feel them to be."{{sfnp|Farr|Peppiatt|Yard|1999|loc=112}}

Van Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978),{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 253}} inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 252}} Theo's son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]] was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964 [[Kisho Kurokawa]] took charge.&lt;ref name=nga&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/vgmsm.shtm |title=Van Gogh's Van Goghs: The Van Gogh Museum |publisher=National Gallery of Art |access-date=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529195527/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/vgmsm.shtm |archive-date=29 May 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.{{sfnp| Rewald|1986|loc= 253}}
