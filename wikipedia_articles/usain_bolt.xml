An eight-time [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists|Olympic gold medallist]], Bolt is the only sprinter to win [[100 metres at the Olympics|Olympic 100 m]] and [[200 metres at the Olympics|200&amp;nbsp;m]] titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). He also won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], which made him the first person to hold both records since [[fully automatic time]] became mandatory.

An eleven-time [[World Championships in Athletics|World Champion]], he won consecutive [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championship 100&amp;nbsp;m]], [[200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|200&amp;nbsp;m]] and [[4 × 100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics|4 × 100 metres relay]] gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100&amp;nbsp;m [[false start]] in 2011. He is the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics#Multiple medallist|most successful male athlete]] of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200&amp;nbsp;m and is one of the most successful in the 100&amp;nbsp;m with three titles.

Bolt improved upon his second [[Men's 100 metres world record progression|100&amp;nbsp;m world record]] of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the [[Men's 200 metres world record progression|200 metres world record]], setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three [[Men's 4 × 100 metres relay world record progression|4 × 100 metres relay world records]], with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100&amp;nbsp;m; he had earlier won numerous 200&amp;nbsp;m medals (including [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|2007 World Championship]] silver) and held the [[List of world junior records in athletics|world under-20]] and [[List of world youth bests in athletics|world under-18 records]] for the event until being surpassed by [[Erriyon Knighton]] in 2021.

His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt", and his awards include the [[IAAF World Athlete of the Year]], [[Track &amp; Field Athlete of the Year]], [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] (three times) and [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]] (four times). Bolt retired after the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics|2017 World Championships]], when he finished third in his last solo 100&amp;nbsp;m race, opted out of the 200&amp;nbsp;m, and pulled up in the 4×100&amp;nbsp;m relay final.

===Early competitions===
Performing for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the [[400 metres]] in the 2001 [[CARIFTA Games]], winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.&lt;ref name=Carifta&gt;{{cite web |title=Carifta Games (Under 17 boys) |publisher=GBR Athletics |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cfgy.htm |access-date=17 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917055503/http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cfgy.htm |archive-date=17 September 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first appearance on the world stage at the [[2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics|2001 IAAF World Youth Championships]] in [[Debrecen]], Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Results – 200 metres – Men – semi-final |publisher=[[IAAF]] |date=14 July 2001 |url=http://www2.iaaf.org/WYC01/Results/data/M/200/Rsf.html |access-date=17 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916213329/http://www2.iaaf.org/WYC01/Results/data/M/200/Rsf.html |archive-date=16 September 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.&lt;ref name=McNeil/&gt; However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.&lt;ref name=Carifta/&gt; He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the [[Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships |publisher=GBR Athletics |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cacy.htm |access-date=17 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919084651/http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cacy.htm |archive-date=19 September 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with [[Valerie Adams]], [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]], [[Jacques Freitag]], [[Yelena Isinbayeva]], [[Jana Pittman]], [[Dani Samuels]], [[David Storl]], and [[Kirani James]]) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister [[P. J.

===Rise to prominence===
The [[2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics|2002 World Junior Championships]] were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to {{convert|1.96|m|ftin}} tall, and he physically stood out among his peers.&lt;ref name=Focus/&gt; He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Results – 200 metres – Men – Final |publisher=[[IAAF]] |date=19 July 2002 |url=http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rf.html |access-date=17 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823014902/http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rf.html |archive-date=23 August 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Results – 200 metres – Men – Heats |publisher=[[IAAF]] |date=18 July 2002 |url=http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rh.html |access-date=8 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727061449/http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rh.html |archive-date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever.&lt;ref name=Longmore/&gt; The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet, although he realized the mistake before the race began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolt's Best Moment - Junior World Championships 2002 {{!}} I AM BOLT |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcLCaQsiDs |access-date=16 October 2019 |date=24 September 2019 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves.&lt;ref&gt;Hattenstone, Simon (28 August 2010).

The year 2005 signalled a fresh start for Bolt in the form of a new coach, [[Glen Mills]], and a new attitude toward athletics.

Misfortune awaited Bolt at the next major event, the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics|2005 World Championships]] in Helsinki.

Bolt took a financial stake in a new Australia-based track and field meeting series – [[Nitro Athletics]]. He performed at the inaugural meet in February 2017 and led his team (Bolt All-Stars) to victory. The competition featured variations on traditional track and field events. He committed himself to three further editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/nitro-goes-off-with-a-bang-returning-crowds-to-athletics/news-story/7fc26c3809c14300385e8a0fc14bcbf8 Nitro goes off with a bang, returning crowds to athletics].

In 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the 2008 Olympics 4×100 metre title due to [[Nesta Carter]]'s disqualification for doping offences. Bolt, who never failed a dope test, was quoted by the BBC saying that the prospect of having to return the gold was "heartbreaking".&lt;ref name=BBCJan17&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/38744846|title=Usain Bolt loses one Olympic gold medal as Nesta Carter tests positive|date=25 January 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=25 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125144538/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/38744846|archive-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banned substance in Carter's test was identified as [[methylhexanamine]], a nasal decongestant sometimes used in dietary supplements.

At the [[2017 World Athletics Championships]], Bolt won his heat uncomfortably after a slow start in 10.07, in his semi-final he improved to 9.98 but was beaten by [[Christian Coleman]] by 0.01. That race broke Bolt's 4 year winning streak in the 100&amp;nbsp;m. In his final individual race, in the final, Bolt won the Bronze medal in 9.95, 0.01 behind Silver medalist Coleman and 0.03 behind World Champion [[Justin Gatlin]]. It was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championship since the 4×100 m relay of the [[2007 World Athletics Championships]]. Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4×100-metre relay team in both the heats and the final. Jamaica won their heat comfortably in 37.95 seconds. In what was intended to be his final race, Bolt pulled up in agony with 50 metres to go and collapsed to the track after what was later confirmed to be another [[hamstring injury]]. He refused a wheelchair and crossed the finish line one last time with the assistance of his teammates [[Omar McLeod]], [[Julian Forte]], and [[Yohan Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/20324713/usain-bolt-injured-final-race-career-great-britain-wins-4x100-final|title=Bolt finale ends in injury and collapse, no gold|work=ESPN.com|access-date=13 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813050749/http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/20324713/usain-bolt-injured-final-race-career-great-britain-wins-4x100-final|archive-date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He popularized the "lightning bolt" pose, also known as "to di world" or "bolting", which he used both before races and in celebration. The pose consists of extending a slightly raised left arm to the side and the right arm folded across the chest, with both hands have the thumb and [[index finger]] outstretched. His performance of the pose during his Olympic and World Championship victories led to widespread copying of the move, from American President [[Barack Obama]] to small children. It has been suggested that the pose comes from Jamaican [[dancehall]] moves of the period,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/08/14/origin-usain-bolt-to-the-world-rio-olympics-2016/88728420/ What's the origin of Usain Bolt's signature celebration?].

The scooters have capabilities to reach up to 30 MPH, but are typically capped at 15 MPH depending on city regulation.
