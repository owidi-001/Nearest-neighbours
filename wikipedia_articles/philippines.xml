{{div col end}}}} is an [[archipelagic state|archipelagic country]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. It is situated in the western [[Pacific Ocean]], and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. The Philippines is bounded by the [[South China Sea]] to the west, the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, and the [[Celebes Sea]] to the southwest, and shares [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]]s with [[Taiwan]] to the north, [[Japan]] to the northeast, [[Palau]] to the east and southeast, [[Indonesia]] to the south, [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]] to the southwest, [[Vietnam]] to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of {{convert|300,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and, {{as of|2020|lc=on}}, had a population of around 109&amp;nbsp;million people, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population|twelfth-most populous country]]. The Philippines is a [[multinational state]], with diverse [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnicities]] and cultures throughout its islands. [[Manila]] is the nation's capital, while the [[Cities of the Philippines#Largest cities|largest city]] is [[Quezon City]], both lying within the urban area of [[Metro Manila]].

[[Negrito]]s, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by [[Models of migration to the Philippines|successive waves]] of [[Austronesian peoples]]. Adoption of [[Animism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] established [[History of the Philippines (900–1565)|island-kingdoms]] called [[Kedatuan]]s, [[Rajahnate]]s and [[Sultanate]]s. The arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer leading a fleet for [[Spain]], marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] named the archipelago ''{{lang|es|[[:es:Filipinas|Las Islas Filipinas]]}}'' in honor of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Spanish settlement through [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Mexico]], beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the [[Spanish Empire]] for more than 300 years. During this time, [[Catholicism]] became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of [[Spanish treasure fleet|trans-Pacific trade]]. In 1896, the [[Philippine Revolution]] began, which then became entwined with the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]]. Spain ceded the territory to the [[United States]], while [[Hong Kong Junta|Filipino rebels]] declared the [[First Philippine Republic]]. The ensuing [[Philippine–American War]] ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|Japanese invasion]] of the islands during [[World War II]]. Following [[Philippines campaign (1944–1945)|liberation]], the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the [[unitary state|unitary]] [[sovereign state]] has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|dictatorship]] by the [[People Power Revolution]].

It is considered to be an [[emerging market]] and a [[newly industrialized country]], which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]], the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum, and the [[East Asia Summit]]. The Philippines' position as an [[List of island countries|island country]] on the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]] and close to the equator makes the country prone to [[Earthquakes in the Philippines|earthquakes]] and [[Typhoons in the Philippines|typhoons]]. The country has a variety of [[natural resource]]s and a globally significant [[megadiverse countries|level of biodiversity]]. This low-lying island geography makes the [[Climate change in the Philippines|country vulnerable to climate change]], increasing risk from [[Typhoons in the Philippines|typhoons]] and [[sea level rise]].

Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]], during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] "''{{lang|es|Felipinas}}''" after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;II of Spain]], then the [[Prince of Asturias]]. Eventually the name "''{{lang|es|Las Islas Filipinas}}''" would be used to cover the archipelago's Spanish possessions.{{sfn|Scott |1994 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=15KZU-yMuisC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}} Before Spanish rule was established, other names such as ''{{lang|es|Islas del Poniente}}'' (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands, ''{{lang|es|San Lázaro}}'', were also used by the Spanish to refer to islands in the region.&lt;ref name="Spate"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/spanish_lake/mobile_devices/ |chapter-url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/spanish_lake/mobile_devices/ch04s05.html |title=The Spanish Lake – The Pacific since Magellan, Volume I |chapter=Chapter 4.

From the period of the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898) and the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902) until the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] period (1935–1946), American colonial authorities referred to the country as ''The Philippine Islands'', a translation of the Spanish name.&lt;ref name="Constantino1975"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Constantino |first1=R |title=The Philippines: a Past Revisited |date=1975 |publisher=Tala Pub.

 |quote                = Given the significance of the size and distribution of the population to the spread of diseases and their ability to become endemic, it is worth commenting briefly on the physical and human geography of the Philippines. The hot and humid tropical climate would have generally favored the propagation of many diseases, especially water-borne infections, though there might be regional or seasonal variations in climate that might affect the incidence of some diseases. In general, however, the fact that the Philippines comprise some seven thousand islands, some of which are uninhabited even today, would have discouraged the spread of infections, as would the low population density.

Mexicans were administrators, priests and soldiers (guachinangos or hombres de pueblo) (Bernal 1964: 188) many though, integrated into the peasant society, even becoming tulisanes ‘bandits’ who in the late 18th century “infested” Cavite and led peasant revolts (Medina 2002: 66). Meanwhile, in the Spanish garrisons, Spanish was used among administrators and priests. Nonetheless, there is not enough historical information on the social role of these men. In fact some of the few references point to a quick integration into the local society: “los hombres del pueblo, los soldados y marinos, anónimos, olvidados, absorbidos en su totalidad por la población Filipina.” (Bernal 1964: 188). In addition to the Manila-Acapulco galleon, a complex commercial maritime system circulated European and Asian commodities including slaves. During the 17th century, Portuguese vessels traded with the ports of Manila and Cavite, even after the prohibition of 1644 (Seijas 2008: 21). Crucially, the commercial activities included the smuggling and trade of slaves: “from the Moluccas, and Malacca, and India… with the monsoon winds” carrying “clove spice, cinnamon, and pepper and black slaves, and Kafir [slaves]” (Antonio de Morga cf Seijas 2008: 21).” Though there is no data on the numbers of slaves in Cavite, the numbers in Manila suggest a significant fraction of the population had been brought in as slaves by the Portuguese vessels. By 1621, slaves in Manila numbered 1,970 out of a population of 6,110. This influx of slaves continued until late in the 17th century; according to contemporary cargo records in 1690, 200 slaves departed from Malacca to Manila (Seijas 2008: 21). Different ethnicities were favored for different labor; Africans were brought to work on the agricultural production, and skilled slaves from India served as caulkers and carpenters.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of the Philippines}}
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map PHL present.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification]] of the Philippines]]
The Philippines has a tropical maritime climate that is usually hot and humid. There are three seasons: a hot dry season or summer from March to May; a rainy season from June to November; and a cool dry season from December to February. The southwest [[monsoon]] lasts from May to October, and the northeast monsoon from November to April. Temperatures usually range from {{convert|21|C|F}} to {{convert|32|C|F}}. The coolest month is January; the warmest is May.&lt;ref name="PAGASA-Climate"&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate of the Philippines |url=http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/information/climate-philippines |website=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration |access-date=July 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418140425/http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/information/climate-philippines |archive-date=April 18, 2018 |quote=Based on the average of all weather stations in the Philippines, excluding Baguio, the mean annual temperature is 26.6o C. The coolest months fall in January with a mean temperature of 25.5oC while the warmest month occurs in May with a mean temperature of 28.3oC. Latitude is an insignificant factor in the variation of temperature while altitude shows greater contrast in temperature. Thus, the mean annual temperature of Baguio with an elevation of 1,500 meters is 18.3oC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average yearly temperature is around {{convert|26.6|C|F}}. In considering temperature, location in terms of latitude and longitude is not a significant factor, and temperatures at sea level tend to be in the same range. Altitude usually has more of an impact. The average annual temperature of [[Baguio]] at an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|sp=us}} above sea level is {{convert|18.3|C|F}}, making it a popular destination during hot summers.&lt;ref name="PAGASA-Climate" /&gt; Annual rainfall measures as much as {{convert|5000|mm|sp=us}} in the mountainous east coast section but less than {{convert|1000|mm|sp=us}} in some of the sheltered valleys.&lt;ref name=cp /&gt;

{{Further|Filipino values}}
[[File:Core Value.JPG|thumb|A statue in [[Iriga City]] commemorating the ''[[Mano (gesture)|mano po]]'' gesture]]

As a general description, the distinct [[value system]] of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity), and commercial relationships.&lt;ref name=CAPH&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm ''Social Values and Organization''], Philippines, Country Studies US. Online version of print book Ronald E. Dolan, ed. ''Philippines: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

American rule introduced new architectural styles. This led to the construction of government buildings and [[Art Deco]] theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by [[Daniel Burnham]] was done on the portions of the city of Manila.

In general, there are two types of Philippine traditional folk dance. The first one reflects the influence under the Spanish occupation and the other, the country's profuseness of tribes that offer their own tribal dances. The music that incorporates the former are mostly [[bandurria]]-based bands that utilizes 14th string guitars. One example of such type is the [[Cariñosa]]. A Hispanic Filipino dance, unofficially considered as the "National Dance of the Philippines".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcdsb.org/FORCOMMUNITY/HeritageCelebration/FilipinoHeritageMonth/Documents/PASSOC_DANCE-1.pdf|title=PASSOC: Philippine Arts &amp; Social Studies in the Ontario Curriculum, Page 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[Tinikling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Games: Building Skills Through Multicultural Play|last = Horowitz|first = Gayle L.|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2009|isbn = 9780736073943|page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; While native dances had become less popular over time,&lt;ref name="Villaruz"/&gt;{{rp|77}} a revival of folk dances began in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Villaruz"/&gt;{{rp|82}} In the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances may vary from the delicate [[ballet]] up to the more street-oriented styles of [[breakdancing]].&lt;ref name="nccadance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=1&amp;i=117|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724234241/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=1&amp;i=117 |archive-date=July 24, 2014|date=July 24, 2014 |title=Philippine Dance in the American Period|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|first=Basilio Esteban S.|last=Villacruz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_ocHJ0_t44C|title=Humanities and the Digital Art|edition=2006|isbn=978-971-23-4628-6|year=2006|pages=[https://books.google.com/?id=3_ocHJ0_t44C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=history+philippine+sculptures#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20philippine%20sculptures&amp;f=false 31-32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Filipino cuisine}}
Regional variations exist throughout the islands, for example [[rice]] is a standard starch in Luzon while [[cassava]] is more common in Mindanao.&lt;ref name="Zibart"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y6vTun3i4NQC&amp;pg=PA266 |title = The Ethnic Food Lover's Companion: Understanding the Cuisines of the World |author = Zibart, Eve |publisher = Menasha Ridge Press |year = 2001 |pages = 268,&lt;!--Estimate--&gt; 277 |isbn = 978-0-89732-372-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors.&lt;ref name=Zialcita&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PEy9G-HLokwC&amp;pg=PA281 |title = Authentic Though not Exotic: Essays on Filipino Identity |author = Zialcita, Fernando Nakpil |publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press |location = Quezon City |year = 2005 |page = 281 |isbn = 978-971-550-479-9}}{{failed verification|date=July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many Asians, most Filipinos do not eat with [[chopsticks]]; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of [[spoon]] and [[fork]], not knife and fork.&lt;ref name="lonelyplanet48"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781741042894 |url-access = registration |quote = filipino cuisine. |title = Philippines |author1 = Rowthorn, Chris |author2 = Greg Bloom |name-list-style = amp |edition = 9th |publisher =Lonely Planet|year = 2006 |page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781741042894/page/48 48] |isbn = 978-1-74104-289-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
