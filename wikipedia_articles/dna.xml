'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Deoxyribonucleic_acid.ogg|d|iː|ˈ|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|ˌ|r|aɪ|b|oʊ|nj|uː|ˌ|k|l|iː|ɪ|k|,_|-|ˌ|k|l|eɪ|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|deoxyribonucleic acid}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''DNA''') is a [[molecule]] composed of two [[polynucleotide]] chains that coil around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] carrying [[genetics|genetic]] instructions for the development, functioning, growth and [[reproduction]] of all known [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es. DNA and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) are [[nucleic acid]]s. Alongside [[protein]]s, [[lipids]] and complex carbohydrates ([[polysaccharide]]s), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of [[macromolecule]]s that are essential for all known forms of [[life]].

The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s as they are composed of simpler [[monomer]]ic units called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 978-0-8153-4432-2 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |name-list-style=vanc |title=DNA |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archive-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[Organophosphate|phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s (known as the phospho-diester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), with [[hydrogen bond]]s to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, [[pyrimidine]]s and [[purine]]s. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.

Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same [[Central dogma of molecular biology#Biological sequence information|biological information]]. This information is [[DNA replication|replicated]] as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for [[Primary protein structure|protein sequences]]. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. [[RNA]] strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes [[uracil]] (U).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Uracil|title=Uracil|website=Genome.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[genetic code]], these RNA strands specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. Before typical [[cell division]], these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] as [[nuclear DNA]], and some in the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] as [[mitochondrial DNA]] or in [[chloroplast]]s as [[chloroplast DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Peter | name-list-style = vanc | title= iGenetics |url= https://archive.org/details/igenetics0000russ_v6o1 |url-access= registration |publisher= Benjamin Cummings |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]], in [[circular chromosome]]s. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins, such as [[histone]]s, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA is a long [[polymer]] made from repeating units called [[nucleotide]]s, each of which is usually symbolized by a single letter: either {{mono|A}}, {{mono|T}}, {{mono|C}}, or {{mono|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Saenger |first= Wolfram | name-list-style = vanc |title= Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure |publisher= Springer-Verlag |location= New York |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-387-90762-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Alberts | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Lewis | first3 = Julian | last4 = Raff | first4 = Martin | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Keith | first6 = Walters | last6 = Peter | name-list-style = vanc | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = Fourth | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2002 | location = New York and London | isbn = 0-8153-3218-1 | oclc = 145080076 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/ | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161101022040/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/ | archive-date = 1 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chargaff's rules]] state that DNA from any species of any organism should have a 1:1 [[protein stoichiometry]] ratio (base pair rule) of [[purine]] and [[pyrimidine]] bases (i.e., {{mono|A+G{{=}}T+C}}) and, more specifically, that the amount of [[guanine]] should be equal to [[cytosine]] and the amount of [[adenine]] should be equal to [[thymine]].

A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a [[nucleoside]], and a base linked to a sugar and to one or more phosphate groups is called a [[nucleotide]]. A [[biopolymer]] comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a [[polynucleotide]].&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite journal | author = IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN) | title = Abbreviations and Symbols for Nucleic Acids, Polynucleotides and their Constituents.

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating [[phosphate]] and [[carbohydrate|sugar]] groups.&lt;ref name=Ghosh&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghosh A, Bansal M | title = A glossary of DNA structures from A to Z | journal = Acta Crystallographica Section D | volume = 59 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 620–26 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12657780 | doi = 10.1107/S0907444903003251|issn=0907-4449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sugar in DNA is [[deoxyribose|2-deoxyribose]], which is a [[pentose]] (five-[[carbon]]) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings. These are known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3&amp;prime;-end|3&amp;prime;-end]] (three prime end), and [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5&amp;prime;-end|5&amp;prime;-end]] (five prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a [[glycosidic bond]].  Therefore, any DNA strand  normally has one end at which there is a phosphate group attached to the 5&amp;prime; carbon of a ribose (the 5&amp;prime; phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl group attached to the 3&amp;prime; carbon of a ribose (the 3&amp;prime; hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3&amp;prime; and 5&amp;prime; carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers [[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]] (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a [[nucleic acid double helix]], the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5&amp;prime; ), and three prime end (3&amp;prime;), with the 5&amp;prime; end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3&amp;prime; end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and [[RNA]] is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

===Nucleobase classification===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, {{mono|A}} and {{mono|G}}, which are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings {{mono|C}} and {{mono|T}}.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] ({{mono|U}}), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial [[nucleic acid analogue]]s have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma S, Eckstein F | title = Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 67 | pages = 99–134 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759484 |issn=0066-4154 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.99 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-canonical bases===

Modified bases  occur in DNA. The first of these recognised was [[5-methylcytosine]], which was found in the [[genome]] of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in 1925.&lt;ref name=Johnson1925&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson TB, Coghill RD | year = 1925 | title = Pyrimidines.

This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.&lt;ref name="pmid27319741"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weigele P, Raleigh EA |title=Biosynthesis and Function of Modified Bases in Bacteria and Their Viruses |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=116 |issue=20 |pages=12655–12687 |date=October 2016 |pmid=27319741 |doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00114 |doi-access=free |issn=0009-2665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications of the bases cytosine and adenine, the more common and modified DNA bases, plays vital roles in the [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] control of gene expression in plants and animals.&lt;ref name="pmid30619465"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar S, Chinnusamy V, Mohapatra T |title=Epigenetics of Modified DNA Bases: 5-Methylcytosine and Beyond |journal=Frontiers in Genetics |volume=9 |pages=640 |date=2018 |pmid=30619465 |pmc=6305559 |doi=10.3389/fgene.2018.00640 |issn=1664-8021 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA-ligand-by-Abalone.png|left|thumb|DNA major and minor grooves. The latter is a binding site for the [[Hoechst stain]] dye 33258.]]

===Grooves===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is {{convert|22|Å|nm}} wide and the other, the minor groove, is {{cvt|12|Å|nm}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson RE | title = Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5784 | pages = 755–58 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 7432492 | doi = 10.1038/287755a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W | s2cid = 4315465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of the major groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pabo CO, Sauer RT | title = Protein-DNA recognition | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 53 | pages = 293–321 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Base pairing===
{{further|Base pair}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[base pair]]ing. Purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix (from six-carbon ring to six-carbon ring) is called a Watson-Crick base pair.  DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low {{mono|GC}}-content. A Hoogsteen base pair (hydrogen bonding the 6-carbon ring to the 5-carbon ring) is a rare variation of base-pairing.&lt;ref name="pmid23818176"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikolova EN, Zhou H, Gottardo FL, Alvey HS, Kimsey IJ, Al-Hashimi HM |title=A historical account of Hoogsteen base-pairs in duplex DNA |journal=Biopolymers |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=955–68 |year=2013 |pmid=23818176 |pmc=3844552 |doi=10.1002/bip.22334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily.

This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in organisms.&lt;ref name=Alberts/&gt;

{{Anchor|ssDNA}}
==== ssDNA vs. dsDNA ====
As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded ('''dsDNA''') structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for {{mono|G,C}} stacks. The two strands can come apart—a process known as melting—to form two single-stranded DNA ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high [[pH]] (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the {{mono|GC}}-content (% {{mono|G,C}} basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the temperature at which 50% of the double-strand molecules are converted to single-strand molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of {{mono|GC}} base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high {{mono|GC}}-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high {{mono|AT}} content have weaker-interacting strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalikian TV, Völker J, Plum GE, Breslauer KJ | title = A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 7853–58 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10393911 | pmc = 22151 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the {{mono|TATAAT}} [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoters]], tend to have a high {{mono|AT}} content, making the strands easier to pull apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = deHaseth PL, Helmann JD | title = Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 817–24 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7476180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x | s2cid = 24479358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break half of the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J | title = Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 51 | pages = 15996–6010 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v | url = http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610205112/http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | archive-date = 10 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense and antisense===
{{further|Sense (molecular biology)}}

A [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequence]] is called a "sense" sequence if it is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015915/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html |date=24 April 2008 }}  JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989. Retrieved 7 May 2008
&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N | title = Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 289–97 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851066 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munroe SH | title = Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 664–71 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252 | s2cid = 23748148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having [[overlapping gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makalowska I, Lin CF, Makalowski W | title = Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680581 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In [[bacteria]], this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson ZI, Chisholm SW | title = Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes | journal = Genome Research | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 2268–72 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15520290 | pmc = 525685 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2433104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RA, Horvath CM | title = Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 261–66 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1771674 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(91)90326-L | pmc = 7173306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercoiling===
{{further|DNA supercoil}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benham CJ, Mielke SP | s2cid = 1427671 | title = DNA mechanics | journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 7 | pages = 21–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ab63/d57290ebf9bc3536fd3f2257a2b509076fc1.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190301225243/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ab63/d57290ebf9bc3536fd3f2257a2b509076fc1.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by [[enzyme]]s called [[topoisomerase]]s.&lt;ref name=Champoux&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Champoux JJ | s2cid = 18144189 | title = DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 70 | pages = 369–413 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11395412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.369 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/983e/e70eabbeccac71bf6a634d1d538225c64c71.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang JC | title = Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 430–40 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12042765 | doi = 10.1038/nrm831 | s2cid = 205496065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These flat four-base units then stack on top of each other to form a stable [[G-quadruplex]] structure.&lt;ref name=Burge&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burge S, Parkinson GN, Hazel P, Todd AK, Neidle S | title = Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 19 | pages = 5402–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17012276 | pmc = 1636468 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and [[chelation]] of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parkinson GN, Lee MP, Neidle S | title = Crystal structure of parallel quadruplexes from human telomeric DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6891 | pages = 876–80 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050675 | doi = 10.1038/nature755 | bibcode = 2002Natur.417..876P | s2cid = 4422211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffith JD, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel RM, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T | s2cid = 721901 | title = Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal = Cell | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–14 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10338214 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.335.2649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands.

===Branched DNA===
{{further|Branched DNA|DNA nanotechnology}}

In DNA, [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seeman NC | title = DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16515737 | pmc = 3478329 | doi = 10.1017/S0033583505004087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branched DNA can be used in [[nanotechnology]] to construct geometric shapes, see the section on [[#Uses in technology|uses in technology]] below.

===Artificial bases===
{{Main|Nucleic acid analogue}}
Several artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named [[Hachimoji DNA]]. Dubbed S, B, P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a predictable way (S–B and P–Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and be transcribed to RNA. Their existence could be seen as an indication that there is nothing special about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matthew | last = Warren | name-list-style = vanc |title=Four new DNA letters double life's alphabet | journal = Nature |date=21 February 2019 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-00650-8 | pmid = 30809059 | volume=566 | issue = 7745 | page=436| doi-access = free | bibcode = 2019Natur.566..436W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Hoshika S, Leal NA, Kim MJ, Kim MS, Karalkar NB, Kim HJ, Bates AM, Watkins NE, SantaLucia HA, Meyer AJ, DasGupta S, Piccirilli JA, Ellington AD, SantaLucia J, Georgiadis MM, Benner SA | display-authors = 6 |title=Hachimoji DNA and RNA: A genetic system with eight building blocks (paywall)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=363 |issue=6429 |pages=884–887 |date=22 February 2019 | doi = 10.1126/science.aat0971 | pmid = 30792304 | pmc=6413494 | bibcode=2019Sci...363..884H}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, DNA is tightly related to [[RNA]] which does not only act as a transcript of DNA but also performs as moleular machines many tasks in cells.

===Base modifications and DNA packaging===
{{further|DNA methylation|Chromatin remodeling}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the [[histone]] protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see [[Chromatin remodeling]]). There is, further, [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Q, Rosenfeld MG | title = Epigenetic regulation of human embryonic stem cells | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 3 | pages = 238 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23133442 | pmc = 3488762 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2012.00238 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one example, cytosine methylation produces [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], which is important for [[X-inactivation]] of chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klose RJ, Bird AP | title = Genomic DNA methylation: the mark and its mediators | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–97 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16403636 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2005.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average level of methylation varies between organisms—the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' lacks cytosine methylation, while [[vertebrate]]s have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–21 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11782440 | doi = 10.1101/gad.947102 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can [[deamination|deaminate]] to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh CP, Xu GL | title = Cytosine methylation and DNA repair | volume = 301 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16570853 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-31390-7_11 | isbn = 3-540-29114-8 | journal = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] in the [[brain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kriaucionis S, Heintz N | title = The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 929–30 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19372393 | pmc = 3263819 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169786 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..929K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[glycosylation]] of uracil to produce the "J-base" in [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratel D, Ravanat JL, Berger F, Wion D | title = N6-methyladenine: the other methylated base of DNA | journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–15 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16479578 | pmc = 2754416 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gommers-Ampt JH, Van Leeuwen F, de Beer AL, Vliegenthart JF, Dizdaroglu M, Kowalak JA, Crain PF, Borst P | s2cid = 24801094 | title = beta-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil: a novel modified base present in the DNA of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei | journal = Cell | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = 1129–36 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8261512 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(93)90322-H | hdl = 1874/5219 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of [[mutagen]]s, which change the [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequence]]. Mutagens include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]] and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[X-ray]]s.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called ''[[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]]''. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]].

==Biological functions==
[[File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Location of eukaryote [[nuclear DNA]] within the chromosomes]]
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and [[circular prokaryote chromosome|circular chromosomes]] in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.&lt;ref name = "Venter_2001"/&gt; The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called [[DNA replication]]. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{further|Cell nucleus|Chromatin|Chromosome|Gene|Noncoding DNA}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]], to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, and [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfsberg TG, McEntyre J, Schuler GD | title = Guide to the draft human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 824–26 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000 | bibcode = 2001Natur.409..824W | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233093 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the "[[C-value enigma]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory TR | title = The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–46 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15596463 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mci009 | pmc = 4246714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].&lt;ref name = "Birney_2007" /&gt;

===Transcription and translation===
{{further|Genetic code|Transcription (genetics)|Protein biosynthesis}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|DNA replication: The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase|topo&amp;shy;iso&amp;shy;merase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{further|DNA replication}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5&amp;prime; to 3&amp;prime; direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albà M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178285 | pmc = 150442 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

===DNA-binding proteins===
{{further|DNA-binding protein}}
[[File:Nucleosome1.png|thumb|260px|left|Interaction of DNA (in orange) with [[histone]]s (in blue). These proteins' basic amino acids bind to the acidic phosphate groups on DNA.]]

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN | s2cid = 21101836 | title = Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350–64 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9893710 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dame RT | title = The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 858–70 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15853876 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04598.x | s2cid = 26965112 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a [[nucleosome]], which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface.

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec JA | title = Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10473346 | doi = 10.1080/10409239991209255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers LC, Kornberg RD | title = Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 69 | pages = 729–49 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spiegelman BM, Heinrich R | title = Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal = Cell | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–67 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15479634 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee WK, Zhang MQ, Ren B | title = A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 14 | pages = 8164–69 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12808131 | pmc = 166200 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332764100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8164L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984" /&gt;

===DNA-modifying enzymes===

====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5&amp;prime;-GATATC-3&amp;prime; and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.57.2.434-450.1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.&lt;ref name=Doherty&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doherty AJ, Suh SW | title = Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 28 | issue = 21 | pages = 4051–58 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11058099 | pmc = 113121 | doi = 10.1093/nar/28.21.4051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt;

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.&lt;ref name=Champoux/&gt; Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoeffler AJ, Berger JM | title = Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1465–70 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16246147 | doi = 10.1042/BST20051465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuteja N, Tuteja R | title = Unraveling DNA helicases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3&amp;prime; [[hydroxyl]] group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5&amp;prime; to 3&amp;prime; direction.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce CM, Steitz TA | title = Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 177 | issue = 22 | pages = 6321–29 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7592405 | pmc = 177480 | doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]s make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3&amp;prime; to 5&amp;prime; [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S | s2cid = 26171993 | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | pages = 133–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e941/98efed7eb8fa606b87d9a44c118c235a62e9.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210126170051/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e941/98efed7eb8fa606b87d9a44c118c235a62e9.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2021-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson A, O'Donnell M | title = Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 74 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.&lt;ref name=Greider/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola ML, Nevinsky GA, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S | title = The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 497–503 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 7514143 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.8.8.7514143 | s2cid = 39614573 | url = http://www.fasebj.org/doi/pdf/10.1096/fasebj.8.8.7514143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication.&lt;ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994/&gt; Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes [[telomeres]] at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez E | s2cid = 24946189 | title = Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–47 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516863 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021258713850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Genetic recombination}}
[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "[[chromosome territories]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cremer T, Cremer C | title = Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–301 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075 | s2cid = 8547149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in [[chromosomal crossover]] which occurs during [[sexual reproduction]], when [[genetic recombination]] occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pál C, Papp B, Lercher MJ | title = An integrated view of protein evolution | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 337–48 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838 | s2cid = 23225873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Driscoll M, Jeggo PA | title = The role of double-strand break repair – insights from human genetics | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–54 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746 | s2cid = 7779574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. [[Non-homologous recombination]] can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vispé S, Defais M | title = Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions | journal = Biochimie | volume = 79 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 587–92 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9466696 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neale MJ, Keeney S | title = Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7099 | pages = 153–58 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885 | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..153N | pmc = 5607947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dickman MJ, Ingleston SM, Sedelnikova SE, Rafferty JB, Lloyd RG, Grasby JA, Hornby DP | s2cid = 39505263 | title = The RuvABC resolvasome | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 22 | pages = 5492–501 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12423347 | doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north–south cleavage. The north–south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east–west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.

DNA contains the genetic information that allows all forms of life to function, grow and reproduce.

In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins A, Morton NE | title = Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 13 | pages = 6007–11 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8016106 | pmc = 44126 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6007C }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weir BS, Triggs CM, Starling L, Stowell LI, Walsh KA, Buckleton J | title = Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–22 | date = March 1997 | doi = 10.1520/JFS14100J | pmid = 9068179 | s2cid = 14511630 | url = http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f47f/2c895d0b06b3dc72a4707b464126e6c820aa.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeffreys AJ, Wilson V, Thein SL | title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 316 | issue = 6023 | pages = 76–79 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2989708 | doi = 10.1038/316076a0 | bibcode = 1985Natur.316...76J | s2cid = 4229883 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061214004903/http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork&amp;nbsp;– first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.

DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |date=September 2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112000837/http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |archive-date=12 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

DNA profiling is also used in [[DNA paternity testing]] to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal [[DNA sequencing]] methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html "Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy" New York Times June 20, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624231639/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html |date=24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioinformatics===
{{further|Bioinformatics}}
[[Bioinformatics]] involves the development of techniques to store, [[data mining|data mine]], search and manipulate biological data, including DNA [[nucleic acid sequence]] data. These have led to widely applied advances in [[computer science]], especially [[string searching algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], and [[database theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baldi|first1= Pierre|author1-link=Pierre Baldi|last2= Brunak|first2= Soren | name-list-style = vanc |title=Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach |publisher= MIT Press |year=2001| isbn=978-0-262-02506-5 |oclc=45951728}}&lt;/ref&gt; String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gusfield | first = Dan | name-list-style = vanc | title = Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = 15 January 1997 | isbn = 978-0-521-58519-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA sequence may be [[sequence alignment|aligned]] with other DNA sequences to identify [[Sequence homology|homologous sequences]] and locate the specific [[mutation]]s that make them distinct.

Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by [[Gene prediction|gene finding]] algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular [[gene product]]s and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally.&lt;ref name="Mount"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Mount DM |title=Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis |edition= 2nd |publisher= Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-87969-712-1|oclc= 55106399|location=Cold Spring Harbor, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entire genomes may also be compared, which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.

===DNA nanotechnology===
[[File:DNA nanostructures.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The DNA structure at left (schematic shown) will self-assemble into the structure visualized by [[Atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopy]] at right.

{{further|DNA nanotechnology}}
DNA nanotechnology uses the unique [[molecular recognition]] properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothemund PW | s2cid = 4316391 | title = Folding DNA to create nanoscale shapes and patterns | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue = 7082 | pages = 297–302 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16541064 | doi = 10.1038/nature04586 | bibcode = 2006Natur.440..297R | url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/22244/3/nature04586-s2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the ''[[DNA origami]]'' method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen ES, Dong M, Nielsen MM, Jahn K, Subramani R, Mamdouh W, Golas MM, Sander B, Stark H, Oliveira CL, Pedersen JS, Birkedal V, Besenbacher F, Gothelf KV, Kjems J | s2cid = 4430815 | title = Self-assembly of a nanoscale DNA box with a controllable lid | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7243 | pages = 73–76 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19424153 | doi = 10.1038/nature07971 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459...73A | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-0010-9362-B | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA machine|Nanomechanical devices]] and [[DNA computing|algorithmic self-assembly]] have also been demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishitsuka Y, Ha T | title = DNA nanotechnology: a nanomachine goes live | journal = Nature Nanotechnology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–82 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19421208 | doi = 10.1038/nnano.2009.101 | bibcode = 2009NatNa...4..281I }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as [[Colloidal gold|gold nanoparticles]] and [[streptavidin]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aldaye FA, Palmer AL, Sleiman HF | title = Assembling materials with DNA as the guide | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5897 | pages = 1795–99 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18818351 | doi = 10.1126/science.1154533 | bibcode = 2008Sci...321.1795A | s2cid = 2755388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and anthropology===
{{further|Phylogenetics|Genetic genealogy}}
Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wray GA | title = Dating branches on the tree of life using DNA | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS0001 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11806830 | pmc = 150454 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-3-1-reviews0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in [[evolutionary biology]]. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, [[population genetics|population geneticists]] can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from [[ecological genetics]] to [[anthropology]].

===Information storage===
{{main|DNA digital data storage}}

DNA as a [[data storage|storage device]] for information has enormous potential since it has much higher [[storage density]] compared to electronic devices.  However, high costs, slow read and write times ([[memory latency]]), and insufficient [[data corruption|reliability]] has prevented its practical use.&lt;ref name="pmid29744271"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panda D, Molla KA, Baig MJ, Swain A, Behera D, Dash M | title = DNA as a digital information storage device: hope or hype? | journal = 3 Biotech | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 239 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29744271 | doi = 10.1007/s13205-018-1246-7 | pmc=5935598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid30073589"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akram F, Haq IU, Ali H, Laghari AT | s2cid = 51905843 | title = Trends to store digital data in DNA: an overview | journal = Molecular Biology Reports | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 1479–1490 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30073589 | doi = 10.1007/s11033-018-4280-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician [[Friedrich Miescher]] who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the [[pus]] of discarded surgical bandages.

Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order.
In 1927, [[Nikolai Koltsov]] proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a "giant hereditary molecule" made up of "two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template".&lt;ref&gt;Koltsov proposed that a cell's genetic information was encoded in a long chain of amino acids.

In February 1953, [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Robert Corey]] proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside.&lt;ref name="pmid16578429"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L, Corey RB | title = A Proposed Structure For The Nucleic Acids | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–97 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 16578429 | pmc = 1063734 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.39.2.84| url = http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/dna/papers/1953p.9-084.html | bibcode = 1953PNAS...39...84P }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Watson and Crick completed their model, which is now accepted as the first correct model of the double-helix of [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|DNA]]. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] [[pub]] in Cambridge to announce that he and Watson had "discovered the secret of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Regis | first = Ed | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2009 | title = What Is Life?: investigating the nature of life in the age of synthetic biology | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-538341-6 | page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 25 April 1953 issue of the journal ''Nature'' published a series of five articles giving the Watson and Crick double-helix structure DNA and evidence supporting it.&lt;ref name=NatureDNA50&gt;{{cite web | work = Nature Archives | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html | title = Double Helix of DNA: 50 Years | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405140401/http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html | archive-date=5 April 2015 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was reported in a letter titled "''MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS A  Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid''", in which they said, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; This letter was followed by a letter from Franklin and Gosling, which was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and of their original analysis method.&lt;ref name=NatFranGos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html | title = Original X-ray diffraction image | publisher = Oregon State Library | access-date = 6 February 2011 | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090130111849/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html | archive-date=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then followed a letter by Wilkins and two of his colleagues, which contained an analysis of ''in vivo'' B-DNA X-ray patterns, and which supported the presence ''in vivo'' of the Watson and Crick structure.&lt;ref name="NatWilk" /&gt;

In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962 | work = Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maddox B | s2cid = 4428347 | title = The double helix and the 'wronged heroine' | journal = Nature | volume = 421 | issue = 6921 | pages = 407–08 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12540909 | doi = 10.1038/nature01399 | url = http://www.biomath.nyu.edu/index/course/hw_articles/nature4.pdf | bibcode = 2003Natur.421..407M | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161017011403/http://www.biomath.nyu.edu/index/course/hw_articles/nature4.pdf | archive-date = 17 October 2016 | df = dmy-all | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the "adaptor hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last= Crick |first= F.H.C. | name-list-style = vanc |title=A Note for the RNA Tie Club | date= 1955 | location = Cambridge, England |url= http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001223217/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date = 1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meselson M, Stahl FW | title = The Replication of DNA in Escherichia Coli | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 671–82 | date = July 1958 | pmid = 16590258 | pmc = 528642 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.44.7.671 | bibcode = 1958PNAS...44..671M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work by Crick and co-workers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called [[Genetic code#Codons|codons]], allowing [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]], and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] to decipher the genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1968 | work = Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings represent the birth of [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pray L | year = 2008 | title = Discovery of DNA structure and function: Watson and Crick. | journal = Nature Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
