The '''Detroit Tigers''' are an American [[professional baseball]] team based in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The Tigers compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League Central|Central division]]. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit as a member of the minor league [[Western League (1885–1899)|Western League]] in 1894 and is the only Western League team still in its original city. They are also the oldest continuous one name, one city franchise in the AL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Carter|title=Aging Franchises|url=https://www.billjamesonline.com/aging_franchises/|website=Bill James Online|date=November 2, 2012|access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their establishment as a major league franchise in 1901, the Tigers have won four [[World Series]] championships ({{wsy|1935}}, {{wsy|1945}}, {{wsy|1968}}, and {{wsy|1984}}), 11 [[List of American League pennant winners|AL pennants]] (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, [[1984 American League Championship Series|1984]], [[2006 American League Championship Series|2006]], [[2012 American League Championship Series|2012]]), and four AL Central division championships (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). They also won division titles in 1972, 1984, and 1987 as a member of the [[American League East|AL East]]. Since [[2000 Detroit Tigers season|2000]], the Tigers have played their home games at [[Comerica Park]] in [[Downtown Detroit]].

The Tigers constructed [[Bennett Park (Detroit)|Bennett Park]] at the corner of [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|Michigan Avenue]] and Trumbull Avenue in [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]] (just west of Downtown Detroit) and began playing there in 1896. In 1912, the team moved into Navin Field, which was built on the same location. It was expanded in 1938 and renamed Briggs Stadium. It was renamed [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in 1961 and the Tigers played there until [[1999 Detroit Tigers season|1999]].

From 1901 to 2020, the Tigers overall win–loss record is 9,369–9,226 (a winning percentage of {{winpct|9369|9226}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Detroit Tigers Team History &amp; Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DET/ |website=Baseball-Reference.com |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |access-date=2019-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise's best winning percentage was .656 in [[1934 Detroit Tigers season|1934]], while its worst was .265 in [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|2003]].

===Western League beginnings (1894–1900) ===
[[File:Detroit Tigers 1900.jpg|thumb|left|1900 Detroit Tigers team photo]]
The franchise was founded as a member of the reorganized Western League in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 40]|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814325124}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally played at Boulevard Park, sometimes called League Park. It was located on East Lafayette, then called Champlain Street, between Helen and East Grand Boulevard, near Belle Isle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=The Tigers first 4th of July game was in 1894|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2013/07/05/the-tigers-first-4th-of-july-game-was-in-1894/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=July 5, 2013|access-date=January 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, owner George Vanderbeck decided to build Bennett Park at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, which would remain the team's base of operations for the next 104 seasons.&lt;ref name="Bennett Park"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium|year=1998|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 58–59]|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814325124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickson&gt;{{cite web|first=Marcus W.|last=Dickson|title=April 28, 1896: There used to be a hay market here: Detroit Tigers open Bennett Park|url=https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/april-28-1896-there-used-be-hay-market-here-detroit-tigers-open-bennett-park|website=Society for American Baseball Research|access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game at The Corner was an exhibition on April 13, 1896. The team, now occasionally called the "Tigers," beat a local semi-pro team, known as the Athletics, by a score of 30–3.&lt;ref name="Bennett Park"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt; The Tigers played their first Western League game at Bennett Park on April 28, 1896, defeating the Columbus Senators 17–2.&lt;ref name="Bennett Park"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt;

At the end of the 1897 season, [[Rube Waddell]] was loaned to the team to gain professional experience. After being fined, Waddell left Detroit to pitch in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=O'Brien|title=Rube Waddell|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/a5b2c2b4|website=Society for American Baseball Research|access-date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Western League renamed itself the American League for 1900, it was still a minor league, but the next year, it broke from the National Agreement and declared itself a major league, openly competing with the [[National League]] for players and for fans in four contested cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 70]|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814325124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Page 73"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 73]|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814325124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Joe|last1=Santry|first2=Cindy|last2=Thomson|title=Ban Johnson|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/dabf79f8|website=Society for American Baseball Research|access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, there were rumors of the team relocating to [[Pittsburgh]]. However, these rumors were put to rest when the two leagues made peace in 1903 when they signed a new National Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium|year=1998|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 77–79]|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814325124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Major League season (1901)===
[[File:5068 detroit tigers-cap-1901.png|thumb|upright=0.85|Logo (1901 to 1902)]]
The Tigers were established as a charter member of the now major league American League in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Year In Review : 1901 American League|url=https://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr1901a.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They played their first game as a major league team at home against the [[1901 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] on April 25, 1901, with an estimated 10,000 fans at Bennett Park.&lt;ref name="Page 73"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigers Timeline|url=https://www.mlb.com/tigers/history/timeline|website=Tigers.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After entering the ninth inning behind 13–4, the team staged a dramatic comeback to win 14–13.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; The team finished third in the eight-team league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1901 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1901.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cobb era (1905–1926)===
====1905====
[[File:1913 Ty Cobb portrait photo.png|thumb|[[Ty Cobb]] in 1913]]
In 1905, the team acquired 18-year-old [[Ty Cobb]], a fearless player with a mean streak, who came to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. The addition of Cobb to an already talented team that included [[Sam Crawford]], [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Bill Donovan]] and [[George Mullin (baseball)|George Mullin]] quickly yielded results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cobb still revered, reviled 100 years after first game|url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2146324|website=ESPN.com|date=August 29, 2005|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1907 American League Champions====
{{Main|1907 Detroit Tigers season}}
Behind the hitting of outfielders Ty Cobb (.350) and Sam Crawford (.323), and the pitching of Bill Donovan and [[Ed Killian]] (25 wins each), the Tigers went 92–58 to win the AL pennant in 1907 by 1.5 games over the [[1907 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1907 Detroit Tigers Statistics|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DET/1907.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1907 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1907.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved on to [[1907 World Series|their first World Series appearance]] against the [[1907 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref name="1907 World Series"&gt;{{cite web|title=1907 World Series|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=1907|website=MLB.com|access-date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tie&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=When the Tigers played to a tie in the World Series|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2013/11/14/when-the-detroit-tigers-played-to-a-tie-in-the-world-series/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=November 14, 2013|access-date=January 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game 1 ended in a rare 3–3 tie, called due to darkness after 12 innings.&lt;ref name="1907 World Series"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tie/&gt; The Tigers scored only three runs in the succeeding four games, never scoring more than one run in a game, and lost the Series, 4–0.&lt;ref name="1907 World Series"/&gt;

====1908 American League Champions====
{{Main|1908 Detroit Tigers season}}
[[File:1908WorldSeries.png|thumb|upright=1.0|[[1908 World Series]] program]]
The Tigers won the AL by just a half-game over the 90–64 [[1908 Cleveland Naps season|Cleveland Naps]] with a 90–63 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1908 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1908.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb hit .324, while Sam Crawford hit .311 with 7 home runs, which was enough to lead the league in the [[Dead-ball era|"dead ball" era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1908 American League Batting Leaders|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1908-batting-leaders.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1908 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]], however, would defeat the Tigers again in the [[1908 World Series]], this time in five games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1908 World Series Chicago Cubs over Detroit Tigers (4–1)|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1908_WS.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the Cubs' last World Championship until [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ronald|last=Blum|title=Cubs win World Series Game 7, end 108-year drought|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/dp-cubs-world-series-beat-indians-game-7-20161103-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|agency=Associated Press|date=November 3, 2016|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1909 American League Champions====
{{Main|1909 Detroit Tigers season}}
In 1909, Detroit posted a 98–54 season, winning the AL pennant by 3.5 games over the Athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1909 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1909.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ty Cobb won the batting triple crown in 1909, hitting .377 with 9 home runs (all inside-the-park) and 107 RBIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball History in 1909|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr1909a.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1909 AL batting"&gt;{{cite web|title=1909 American League Batting Leaders|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1909-batting-leaders.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led the league with 76 stolen bases.&lt;ref name="1909 AL batting"/&gt; George Mullin was the pitching hero, going 29–8 with a 2.22 ERA, while fellow pitcher [[Ed Willett]] went 21–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1909 Detroit Tigers Statistics|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DET/1909.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mullin's 11–0 start in 1909 was a Tiger record for 104 years, finally being broken by [[Max Scherzer]]'s 13–0 start in [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew B.|last=Mowery|title=Scherzer makes history, becoming first Tigers starter to post an 11–0 record to begin the season|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/op/20130622/news/306229950/|website=The Oakland Press|date=June 22, 2013|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Lowe|title=Max Scherzer first pitcher to start 12–0 in 27 years|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/06/28/max-scherzer-12-0-first-since-1986-tigers-beat-rays/2474509/|website=USA Today|agency=Detroit Free Press|date=June 28, 2013|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Axisa|title=Rangers hand Max Scherzer first loss of 2013|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/rangers-hand-max-scherzer-first-loss-of-2013/|website=CBS Sports|date=July 13, 2013|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hoped that a new opponent in the [[1909 World Series|1909 Series]], the [[1909 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], would yield different results.

On August 19, 1921, Cobb collected his 3,000th career hit off [[Elmer Myers]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

====1927–1933====
Though the Tigers struggled with mediocre records in the seven years following Cobb's departure, they were building a solid foundation, adding slugging first baseman [[Hank Greenberg]] and pitchers [[Tommy Bridges]] and [[Schoolboy Rowe]] to a lineup that already included second baseman [[Charlie Gehringer]].&lt;ref name="Cochrane freep"&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Ferkovich|title=1935 Tigers: Missing the Babe leads to HR hire in Cochrane|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2015/09/27/detroit-tigers-world-series-babe-ruth/72921784/|website=Detroit Free Press|date=September 27, 2015|access-date=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the final week of the 1938 season, the Tigers presciently held out doubts about a pennant in 1939, but figured that 1940 would be their year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uMYLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tFQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2621,2121213&amp;dq=detroit-tigers-are-figuring-on-a-pennant Detroit Tigers Point to Pennant in 1940], Sid Feder, ''The Evening Independent'', St. Petersburg, Florida, September 29, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

====1945 World Series Champions====

With the end of World War II and the timely return of Hank Greenberg and others from the military, the Tigers won the AL pennant by just 1.5 games over the [[1945 Washington Senators season|Washington Senators]] with an 88–65 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Rosengren|title=The Return of Hank Greenberg|url=https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/baseball-history/hank-greenberg-return|website=Baseball Hall of Fame|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1945 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1945.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hal Newhouser became the first pitcher in the history of the AL, and still the only pitcher as of 2021, to win the MVP Award in two consecutive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David|last1=Nemec|first2=Scott|last2=Flatow|title=Baseball Feats, Facts and Firsts|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/greatbaseballfea00davi/page/153 153]|publisher=Berkley|isbn=978-0451223630|url=https://archive.org/details/greatbaseballfea00davi/page/153|edition=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newhouser won the [[Triple Crown (baseball)#Pitching Triple Crown|pitching triple crown]], leading the AL in wins (25), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed|last=Eagle|title=Triple Crown in Pitching|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/triple-crown-in-pitching/c-266118846|website=MLB.com|date=March 1, 2018|access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Newhouser, [[Virgil Trucks]] and Dizzy Trout on the mound and Greenberg leading the offense, Detroit responded in a World Series Game 7 for the first time, staking Newhouser to a 5–0 lead before he threw a pitch en route to a 9–3 victory over the [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1945 World Series|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=1945|website=MLB.com|access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen V.|last=Rice|title=October 10, 1945: Newhouser leads Tigers to Game 7 victory|url=https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/october-10-1945-newhouser-leads-tigers-game-7-victory|website=Society for American Baseball Research|access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many stars had not yet returned from the military, some baseball scholars have deemed the [[1945 World Series]] to be among the worst-played contests in World Series history.

During the [[1946 Detroit Tigers season|1946 season]], the Tigers acquired [[George Kell]], a third baseman who would become a 10-time all-star and Hall of Famer.&lt;ref name="Kell ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Kell, former Detroit Tigers broadcaster, dies at 86|url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4011970|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2009|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kell NYT"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Kell, 86, Detroit Tigers Hall of Famer and Broadcaster, Dies|first=Richard|last=Goldstein|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/sports/baseball/25kell.html|website=The New York Times|date=March 24, 2009|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He batted over .300 in eight straight seasons (1946–53), and finished with a career .306 average.&lt;ref name="Kell ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kell NYT"/&gt; Kell won the batting title in a very close race with [[Ted Williams]] in [[1949 Detroit Tigers season|1949]], going 2-for-3 on the last day of the season to edge out the Red Sox slugger, .34291 to .34276.&lt;ref name="Kell ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kell NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=The Day George Kell Won the Batting Title|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2014/08/31/day-george-kell-won-batting-title/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=August 31, 2014|access-date=January 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1950 Detroit Tigers season|1950 season]] was particularly frustrating, as the Tigers posted a 95–59 record for a .617 winning percentage, the fourth-best in team history at the time. However, they finished that season three games behind a strong [[1950 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] team that went on to sweep the [[1950 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in the [[1950 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref name="1950 season"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Anderson|title=In October 1950, Yankees Pitching Delivered a Sweep of the Phillies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/sports/baseball/27anderson.html|website=The New York Times|date=October 26, 2009|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding Detroit's fall in the standings, the decade saw the debut of outfielder [[Al Kaline]] in 1953. One of the few major league players who never played a day in the minor leagues, he would hit over .300 nine times in his career. He also made 15 All-Star teams, won 10 Gold Gloves, and featured one of the league's best arms in right field.

=====1972 ALCS=====
{{main|1972 American League Championship Series}}

In the 1972 American League Championship Series, Detroit faced the American League West division champion [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], who had become steadily competitive ever since the 1969 realignment.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=OKennedy|title=Playoff flashback, 1972: Oakland A's vs Detroit Tigers|url=https://www.blessyouboys.com/2013/9/30/4781516/playoff-flashback-1972-oakland-as-vs-detroit-tigers|website=Bless You Boys|date=September 30, 2013|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Game 1 of the ALCS in Oakland, Mickey Lolich, the hero of '68, took the hill and allowed just one run over nine innings. The Athletics' ace, [[Catfish Hunter]], matched Lolich, surrendering only a solo home run to Norm Cash, and the game went into extra innings.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; Al Kaline hit a solo homer to break a 1–1 tie in the top of the 11th inning, only to be charged with a throwing error on [[Gonzalo Marquez]]'s game-tying single in the bottom half of the frame that allowed [[Gene Tenace]] to score the winning run.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; [[Blue Moon Odom]] shut down Detroit 5–0 in Game 2.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; The end of Game 2 was marred by an ugly incident in which Tigers reliever [[Lerrin LaGrow]] hit A's shortstop and leadoff hitter [[Bert Campaneris]] on the ankle with a pitch. An angered Campaneris threw the bat at LaGrow, and LaGrow ducked just in time for the bat to sail over his head. Both benches cleared, and though no punches were thrown, both LaGrow and Campaneris were suspended for the remainder of the series. It was widely believed that Martin had ordered the pitch that hit Campaneris, who had three hits, two stolen bases and two runs scored in the game.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://launiusr.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/was-billy-martin-the-most-%E2%80%9Cbad-ass%E2%80%9D-baseball-manager-of-them-all/|title=Was Billy Martin the Most "Bad Ass" Baseball Manager of them All?|publisher=Launiusr.wordpress.com |date=October 8, 2010 |access-date=December 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012151700/http://launiusr.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/was-billy-martin-the-most-%E2%80%9Cbad-ass%E2%80%9D-baseball-manager-of-them-all/ |archive-date=October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the series shifted to Detroit, the Tigers caught their stride. Joe Coleman held the A's scoreless on seven hits in Game 3, striking out 14 batters in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1972 American League Championship Series (ALCS) Game 3, Oakland Athletics at Detroit Tigers, October 10, 1972|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET197210100.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game 4 was another pitchers' duel between Hunter and Lolich, resulting again in a 1–1 tie at the end of nine innings. Oakland scored two runs in the top of the 10th and put the Tigers down to their last three outs.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; Detroit pushed two runs across the plate to tie the game before Jim Northrup came through in the clutch again. His single off [[Dave Hamilton (baseball)|Dave Hamilton]] scored [[Gates Brown]] to give the Tigers a 4–3 win and even the series at two games apiece.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt;

A first-inning run on an RBI ground out from Bill Freehan, set up by a Gene Tenace passed ball that allowed [[Dick McAuliffe]] to reach third, gave Detroit an early lead in the deciding fifth and final game in Detroit.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; [[Reggie Jackson]]'s steal of home in the second inning tied it up, though Jackson was injured in a collision with Freehan and had to leave the game.&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; Tenace's two-out single to left field plated [[George Hendrick]] to give Oakland a 2–1 lead in the fourth inning. The run was controversial to many Tigers fans, as Hendrick was ruled safe at first base two batters prior to the Tenace hit. Hendrick appeared to be out by two steps on a grounder to short, but umpire John Rice ruled that Norm Cash pulled his foot off first base. Replays and photos, however, show that Cash did not pull his foot.&lt;ref name=Northrup/&gt;&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt; Thanks to that play and four innings of scoreless relief from [[Vida Blue]], the A's took the AL pennant and a spot in the [[1972 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref name="1972 ALCS"/&gt;

===A slow decline (1973–1978)===
The [[1973 Detroit Tigers season|1973 season]] saw the Tigers drop to third place in the division, with an 85–77 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1973 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1973.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Coleman posted another 23 wins, but the other Tiger starters had subpar seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1973 Detroit Tigers Statistics|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DET/1973.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willie Horton hit .316, but injuries limited him to just 111 games.&lt;ref name=Horton/&gt; Jim Northrup posted the best batting average of his career (.307) but was inexplicably limited to part-time duty (119 games played), which Northrup attributed to an ongoing feud with Billy Martin that had actually started in the 1972 ALCS. Northrup even proclaimed to the press that Martin "took the fun out of the game."&lt;ref name=Northrup/&gt; Martin did not survive the 1973 season as manager. He was fired that September after ordering his pitchers to throw [[spitball]]s (and telling the press that he did so) in protest of opposing [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Gaylord Perry]], whom Martin was convinced was doing the same.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin fired"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Hawkins|title=Billy Martin Fired by Tigers|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13612431/billy_martin_fired_by_tigers_offfield/|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 3, 1973|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third base coach [[Joe Schultz]] served as interim manager for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref name="Martin fired"/&gt;

A bright spot for the Tigers in 1973 was relief pitcher [[John Hiller]], who marked his first full season since suffering a heart attack in 1971 by collecting a league-leading 38 saves and posting a brilliant 1.44 ERA.&lt;ref name=Hiller&gt;{{cite web|first=Bruce|last=Markusen|title=Hiller's amazing comeback is one of Tigers' greatest triumphs over adversity|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2013/12/17/hillers-amazing-comeback-is-one-tigers-greatest-triumphs-over-adversity/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=December 17, 2013|access-date=January 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiller's saves total would stand as a Tiger record until [[2000 Detroit Tigers season|2000]], when it was broken by [[Todd Jones]]' 42 saves (Jones' record would later be broken by [[José Valverde]]'s 49 saves in 2011).&lt;ref name=Hiller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigers ready to cope without their closer|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/news/tigers-ready-to-cope-without-their-closer/article_271ef07d-9e67-561f-81a1-219f4c1b1b30.html|website=The Oakland Press|date=April 3, 2006|access-date=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valverde delivery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jose Valverde Named Winner of the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Year Award|url=http://www.mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20111005&amp;content_id=25508294&amp;vkey=pr_mlbcom&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|website=MLB.com|date=October 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023162936/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20111005&amp;content_id=25508294&amp;vkey=pr_mlbcom&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|archive-date=October 23, 2013|access-date=October 22, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the season, the Tigers hired [[Ralph Houk]] to be their new manager. Houk served in that capacity for five full seasons, through the end of the 1978 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Vorperian|title=Ralph Houk|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/7ba0b8fa|website=Society for American Baseball Research|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roster of players who played under Houk were mostly aging veterans from the 1960s, whose performance had slipped from their peak years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Holmes|title=War hero Houk managed Tigers through transitional era in 1970s|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2012/12/21/war-hero-houk-managed-tigers-through-transitional-phase-in-1970s/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=December 21, 2012|access-date=January 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tigers did not have a winning season from 1974 to 1977, and their 57 wins in the [[1975 Detroit Tigers season|1975 season]] was the team's lowest since [[1952 Detroit Tigers season|1952]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1974 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1974.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1975 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1975.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1976 season"&gt;{{cite web|title=1976 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1976.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1977 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1977.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the biggest signal of decline for the Tigers was the retirement of Kaline following the 1974 season, after he notched his [[3,000 hit club|3,000th career hit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Baseball Hall of Fame – The 3,000 Hit Club – Al Kaline|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/3000_hit_club/kaline_al.htm|website=Baseball Hall of Fame|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lynn|last=Henning|title=399: Kaline's last day short of history, long on regret|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2015/05/26/kalines-last-day-short-history-long-regret/27988713/|website=The Detroit News|date=May 26, 2015|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaline finished with 3,007 hits and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1980.&lt;ref name="Kaline HOF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaline, Al|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/kaline-al|website=Baseball Hall of Fame|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Gage|title=Al Kaline, turning 80, reflects on Hall of Fame career|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2014/12/11/al-kaline-turning-reflects-hall-fame-career/20276143/|website=The Detroit News|date=December 11, 2014|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger fans were provided a glimmer of hope when 21-year-old rookie [[Mark Fidrych]] made his debut in 1976.&lt;ref name=Fidrych&gt;{{cite web|first=Rich|last=Puerzer|title=Mark Fidrych|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/a9b9cdb2|website=Society for American Baseball Research|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidrych, known as "The Bird", was a colorful character known for talking to the baseball and other eccentricities.&lt;ref name=Fidrych/&gt; During a game against the [[1976 New York Yankees season|Yankees]], [[Graig Nettles]] responded to Fidrych's antics by talking to his bat. After making an out, he later lamented that his Japanese-made bat did not understand him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bird: The Life and Legacy of Mark Fidrych Book Review|url=https://www.baseball-almanac.com/dugout_2013_b.shtml|website=Baseball Almanac|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidrych entered the All-Star break at 9–2 with a 1.78 ERA, and was the starting pitcher for the American League in the [[1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] played that year in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]] to celebrate the American [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]].&lt;ref name=Fidrych/&gt; He finished the season with a record of 19–9 and an American League-leading [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 2.34.&lt;ref name=Fidrych/&gt; Fidrych, the AL Rookie of the Year, was one of the few bright spots that year with the Tigers finishing next to last in the AL East in 1976.&lt;ref name="1976 season"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fidrych/&gt;

Aurelio Rodríguez won the [[Gold Glove Award]] in 1976 at third base, snapping a streak in which Hall of Famer [[Brooks Robinson]] had won it for 16 consecutive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Holmes|title=Aurelio Rodriguez: The Detroit Tiger with the Golden Arm|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2011/04/15/aurelio-rodriguez-the-detroit-tiger-with-the-golden-arm/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=April 15, 2011|access-date=January 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in 1968, the Tigers' next World Series season would be preceded by a disappointing second-place finish, as the [[1983 Detroit Tigers season|1983 Tigers]] won 92 games to finish six games behind the [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the AL East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1983 American League Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1983.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of futility, the 2006 season showed signs of hope. The impressive rookie campaigns of eventual AL Rookie of the Year [[Justin Verlander]], centerfielder [[Curtis Granderson]], and flamethrowing relief pitcher [[Joel Zumaya]], coupled with a well-publicized early-season tirade by Leyland, helped the team explode and quickly rise to the top of the AL Central.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leyland/&gt; The team reached a high point when they were 40 games over .500, but a second half swoon started to raise questions about the team's staying power.&lt;ref name="Blown lead"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leyland/&gt; On August 27, a 7–1 victory over the [[2006 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] gave the Tigers their 82nd victory and their first winning season since 1993.&lt;ref name=Leyland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Tigers at Cleveland Indians Box Score, August 27, 2006|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE200608270.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers' gem helps Tigers avoid sweep vs. Indians|url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260827105|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=August 28, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330050101/http://www.espn.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260827105|archive-date=March 30, 2019|access-date=January 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, the Tigers beat the [[2006 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 11–4 to clinch their first playoff berth since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Tigers at Kansas City Royals Box Score, September 24, 2006|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/KCA/KCA200609240.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit rejoices in its first postseason since 1987|url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2601779|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=September 25, 2006|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A division title seemed inevitable. All that was required was one win in the final five games of the season, which included three games against the Royals, whom the Tigers had manhandled much of the season.

There are various legends about how the Tigers got their [[nickname]].&lt;ref name=MCB&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristen|last=Bentley|title=Detroit Tigers: Why Are the Tigers the Tigers?|url=https://motorcitybengals.com/2016/03/19/detroit-tigers-why-are-the-tigers-the-tigers/|website=Motor City Bengals|date=March 19, 2016|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bak&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium|date=1998|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw532hJGaTwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 46–49]|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0814325124}}&lt;/ref&gt; One involves the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings.&lt;ref name=MCB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bak/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigers list"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Holmes|title=10 things most fans don't know about the Detroit Tigers|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2016/06/29/10-things-fans-dont-know-detroit-tigers/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=June 29, 2016|access-date=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tigers manager [[George Stallings]] took credit for the name. However, the earliest known use of it appeared in the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' on April 16, 1895, a year prior to Stallings joining the team.&lt;ref name=Bak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zlati|last=Meyer|title=This week in Michigan history: Detroit baseball team 1st called Tigers in Freep|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/04/11/detroit-tigers-name-michigan-history/25635345/|website=Detroit Free Press|date=April 11, 2015|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium'', Richard Bak states that the name originated from the [[Detroit Light Guard]] military unit, who were known as "The Tigers". They had played significant roles in certain [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battles and in the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]]. Upon entry into the majors, the ballclub sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use its [[trademark]]. From that day forth, the team has been known officially as the Tigers.&lt;ref name=Bak/&gt;

==Rivalries and fan base==
The Tigers' [[Major League Baseball rivalries|rivalries]] with other baseball franchises have changed throughout the years, with no one rivalry standing out. The most notable of them are with [[Midwestern United States|regional]] neighbors [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref name="Rivalries BYB"&gt;{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Rogacki|title=Who are the Tigers' three biggest rivals?|url=https://www.blessyouboys.com/2015/2/4/7974435/detroit-tigers-rivals-al-central|website=Bless You Boys|date=February 4, 2015|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The others are with nearby teams such as the [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Minnesota Twins]], and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], the latter a holdover from when the Tigers competed in the AL East.&lt;ref name="Rivalries BYB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=LaMar|title=Which team is the Royals' biggest rival?|url=https://www.royalsreview.com/2015/4/30/8517913/which-team-is-the-royals-biggest-rival|website=Royals Review|date=April 30, 2015|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=McMann|title=Rivalry forming between the Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals?

The Tigers have had some rivalries with NL teams that they have faced repeatedly in the [[World Series]], such as the [[Chicago Cubs]] (four times) and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (three times).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Thomas|title=Storied Tigers-Cubs Rivalry Dates Back 102 Years|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2009/06/22/storied-tigers-cubs-rivalry-dates-back-102-years/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=June 22, 2009|access-date=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Pelc|title=Detroit Tigers-St. Louis Cardinals: Natural Interleague Rivals|url=https://motorcitybengals.com/2015/05/15/detroit-tigers-and-st-louis-cardinals-the-real-natural-interleague-rivals/|website=Motor City Bengals|date=May 15, 2015|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[interleague play]], the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] are the Tigers' "natural rival."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirates' interleague 'rival' slated to be Tigers|url=https://archive.triblive.com/sports/pirates/pirates-interleague-rival-slated-to-be-tigers/|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=August 22, 2012|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry with the Indians came to a head when the Tigers played the Indians at [[Progressive Field]] in [[Cleveland]] on August 7, 2013, with the teams first and second in the AL Central standings. Many Tigers fans who made the short trip to Cleveland started several "Let's go Tigers!" chants while the game was tied in the 9th inning. Irritated that their rivals were "taking over" their home stadium, many Indians fans decided to combat the chant with a "Detroit's bankrupt!" chant, in reference to the [[Detroit bankruptcy|city's 2013 bankruptcy]]. Footage of the game from [[SportsTime Ohio]] that had the chants clearly audible quickly went [[Viral video|viral]], with many baseball fans on [[social media]] criticizing the Indians fans for the chant due to the circumstances of [[Decline of Detroit|Detroit's financial situation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Michael|last1=Brookbank|first2=Kimberlee|last2=Rohrer|title=VIDEO: Indians fans' 'Detroit's bankrupt' chant goes viral|url=https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/baseball/indians/video-indians-fans-detroits-bankrupt-chant-goes-viral|publisher=News 5 Cleveland|date=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028033920/https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/baseball/indians/video-indians-fans-detroits-bankrupt-chant-goes-viral|archive-date=October 28, 2018|access-date=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tigers ended up defeating the Indians 6–5 in 14 innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2013/08/08/prince-fielder-detroit-tigers-cleveland-indians/2630465/ |title=Tigers outlast Indians in 14 innings |newspaper=USA Today |date=August 8, 2013 |access-date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally cry==
During the 1968 season, the team was cheered on by the phrase, "Go Get 'Em, Tigers", which was made popular by a song of the same name written and recorded by [[Artie Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Newman|title=Download a hot Motown ringtone|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/1718667/|website=MLB.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301113036/http://m.mlb.com/news/article/1718667/|archive-date=March 1, 2016|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sock it to 'em, Tigers!" was also a popular phrase during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Bak|title=50 Years Later: A Look Back at the Tigers' 1968 World Series Win|url=https://www.hourdetroit.com/community/50-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-tigers-1968-world-series-win/|website=Hour Detroit|date=July 2, 2018|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Edwards|title=How the 1968 Detroit Tigers helped heal a city|url=https://thedrivemagazine.com/posts/1968-detroit-tigers-heal-a-city/|website=The Drive|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1984 World Series championship run, the team was cheered on to the cry, "Bless You Boys," a phrase coined by sportscaster Al Ackerman.&lt;ref name="Ackerman BYB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackerman COD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bless You Boys: A Celebration of the '84 Tigers|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/history/bless_you_boys.jsp|website=MLB.com|access-date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the team began using the phrase "Who's Your Tiger?" as its slogan.&lt;ref name=Zeringue&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Hill Zeringue|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/team/team_frontoffice_bio.jsp?loc=ellen_hill|website=MLB.com|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006 season, a rally cry caught on in the Tigers' dugout. In a June game versus the New York Yankees, Tigers pitcher [[Nate Robertson]] was featured in an in-game interview with [[Fox Sports Detroit|FSN Detroit]]. During the interview, Robertson began to stuff [[Big League Chew]] bubble gum into his mouth. The Tigers would spark a rally, in which they came back to tie the game. As a result, the phrase "Gum Time" became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nate|last=Robertson|title=How Gum Time Started|url=http://naterobertson.mlblogs.com/2006/06/26/how-gum-time-started/|website=MLB.com|date=June 26, 2006|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=D'Addona|title=How "Gum Time" became a dugout rally ritual for the 2006 Detroit Tigers|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2017/06/12/gum-time-became-dugout-rally-ritual-2006-detroit-tigers/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=June 12, 2017|access-date=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the chant of a local man, the late James Van Horn, who patrolled the streets around Comerica Park yelling out "Eat 'Em Up Tigers! Eat 'Em Up!", was very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Solano|title=Known for 'Eat 'em up Tigers' shouts, James Van Horn carved out niche, Tigers style|url=http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/sports/james-van-horn-carved-out-niche-tigers-style|work=WXYZ.com|date=July 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054648/https://www.wxyz.com/dpp/sports/james-van-horn-carved-out-niche-tigers-style|archive-date=July 30, 2013|access-date=January 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the team used the phrase "Always a Tiger" as its slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Casselberry|title=Once a Tiger, Always a Tiger?|url=https://www.blessyouboys.com/2009/1/10/715971/once-a-tiger-always-a-tige|website=Bless You Boys|date=January 10, 2009|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the slogan was switched back to "Who's Your Tiger?"&lt;ref name=Zeringue/&gt;

During the 2018 season, a rally cry caught on with both players and fans. In a May game versus the [[Los Angeles Angels]], a goose appeared on the field during a second rain delay. After a few minutes, it left the field only to fly into the scoreboard. The goose was unharmed. When the game resumed, the Tigers scored five runs in the sixth inning. They ultimately won the game, 6–1. As a result, the goose was referred to as the "Rally Goose" and the phrase became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=George|last=Sipple|title=Rally Goose OK, Detroit Tigers best L.A.

* The Tigers' uniforms have more belt loops than those of any other team, owing to the fact that their uniform pants do not feature the wide "tunnel" loops that appear on most baseball pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Lukas|title=Uni Watch: MLB's top 10 uniform oddities|url=https://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/3750/mlbs-top-10-biggest-uniform-oddities|website=ESPN.com|date=June 8, 2012|access-date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternate jerseys:'''

In 1995, the Tigers introduced a solid navy blue [[Third jersey|alternate jersey]], which featured the team's primary [[logo]] at the time, a tiger stepping through the D, on the chest. It was worn for one home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Lukas|title=Uni Watch: One and done|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070823|website=ESPN.com|access-date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers wear the throwback jerseys of the [[Detroit Stars]] for their annual Negro Leagues Tribute Game in order to pay tribute to the [[Negro leagues]] players and their contributions to the game of baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigers honor Torii Hunter during 16th annual Negro Leagues Weekend|url=https://www.mlb.com/tigers/press-release/tigers-honor-torii-hunter-during-16th-annual-negro-leagues-weekend-280226310|website=MLB.com|date=June 7, 2018|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers wear a white and navy blue home jersey with "Tigres" across the chest for their annual "¡Fiesta Tigres!" game to recognize and honor the contributions of Hispanic and Latino players and coaches to the game of baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Littmann|title=Detroit Tigers become 'Tigres' to celebrate Hispanic and Latino heritage|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb-news/4513927-detroit-tigers-spanish-uniform-jersey-fiesta-tigres|website=Sporting News|date=July 30, 2013|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all of MLB, the Tigers wear a highly stylized and brightly colored jersey for [[Players Weekend]]. In the inaugural games from August 25–27, 2017, their away jerseys were grey with bright orange with "Tigers" on the chest, the orange cap had a tiger instead of the Old English "D" on it. Players were also encouraged to use nicknames on the back of their jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Beck|title=Tigers to celebrate Players Weekend|url=https://www.mlb.com/tigers/news/tigers-to-celebrate-players-weekend-c247198956|website=MLB.com|date=August 15, 2017|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2018 season, the Tigers wore a blue jersey with orange sleeves that said "Tigers" on the chest, with an orange cap that had a tiger on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Galli|title=See the Tigers' hats and jerseys for Players' Weekend|url=https://www.wxyz.com/sports/baseball/tigers/see-the-tigers-hats-and-jerseys-for-players-weekend|website=WXYZ.com|date=August 9, 2018|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
