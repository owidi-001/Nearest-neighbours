Many of his films are known for their depiction of [[violence]] and the liberal use of [[profanity]]. Scorsese has also dedicated his life to [[film preservation]] and [[film restoration]] by founding the nonprofit organization [[The Film Foundation]] in 1990, as well as the [[World Cinema Foundation]] in 2007 and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017.&lt;ref name="indiewire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/african-film-heritage-project-martin-scorsese-restorations-1202046208/|title= Martin Scorsese and the African Film Heritage Project Are Bringing Four Vital Films Home|website= IndieWire|date= February 23, 2019|access-date= April 7, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200118162740/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/african-film-heritage-project-martin-scorsese-restorations-1202046208/|archive-date= January 18, 2020|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese studied at [[New York University]] (NYU), where he received a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1964, and received a master's degree in fine arts in film from NYU's [[Tisch School of the Arts]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nyu.edu/washington-dc/nyu-washington--dc-events/42nd-jefferson-lecture-with-martin-scorsese.html|title= 42nd Jefferson Lecture with Martin Scorsese|website= nyu.edu.com|access-date= May 9, 2020|archive-date= May 26, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200526123144/https://www.nyu.edu/washington-dc/nyu-washington--dc-events/42nd-jefferson-lecture-with-martin-scorsese.html|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Scorsese's first feature film ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'' was released and was accepted into the [[Chicago Film Festival]], where critic [[Roger Ebert]] saw it and called it "a marvelous evocation of American city life, announcing the arrival of an important new director".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/whos-that-knocking-at-my-door-1969|title= Who's That Knocking at My Door – Review|website= [[Roger Ebert.com]]|access-date= May 9, 2020|archive-date= December 27, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045145/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/whos-that-knocking-at-my-door-1969|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scorsese's mentors included [[John Cassavetes]], whose chatty, improvisational style did much to influence Scorsese's scripts and production work, and who told him to "make films about what you know". While attending New York University, Scorsese met and became good friends with director [[Michael Wadleigh]]. They were both passionate about rock music, and came up with the idea of staging a rock concert and documenting it, which ended up becoming the Oscar Award winning documentary Woodstock. Scorsese served as the assistant director and editor for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Donato|first=Raffaele|title=Docufictions: An Interview with Martin Scorsese on Documentary Film.|url=http://demo.schempc.com/ks/uploads/English-1302/term%20paper/sources/Interview%20with%20Martian%20Scosazie.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 Scorsese moved to [[Hollywood]], where he associated with some of the young directors who defined the decade, including [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Brian De Palma]], and [[George Lucas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/martin-scorsese-biography|title= Martin Scorsese – Jefferson Lecture|website= [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]|access-date= May 9, 2020|archive-date= February 27, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200227201923/https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/martin-scorsese-biography|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directed ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'' (1972), a cut-rate Depression-era film for [[Roger Corman]], and ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), a personal film about faith and redemption shot in [[Little Italy|New York's Little Italy]], starring [[Harvey Keitel]] and [[Robert De Niro]].

He has established a [[filmmaking]] history involving repeat collaborations with actors and film technicians, including [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|nine films]] made with [[Robert De Niro]]. His films with De Niro are the psychological thriller ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), the biographical sports drama ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), the satirical black comedy ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1982), the musical drama ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' (1977), the psychological thriller ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1991), and the crime films ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Irishman]]'' (2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800014966 |title=Yahoo!

''The Departed'' won Scorsese an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Scorsese is also known for his long-time collaboration with film editor [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], who has edited every Scorsese film beginning with his debut ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'' (1967) and later ''Raging Bull'', back in 13 years. Scorsese's other film work includes the black comedy ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), the romantic drama ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'' (1993), the children's adventure drama ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' (2011), and the religious epics ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) and ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'' (2016).

Scorsese's films have consistently garnered critical acclaim, with nine nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], Scorsese is the most-nominated living director and is second only to [[William Wyler]]'s twelve nominations overall. In 2007, Scorsese was presented with the [[Kennedy Center Honor]] at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] for his influence in American culture, and five of his films have been inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kennedycenter/kennedy-center-honors-five-including-scorsese-idUSN1145449620070911|title= Kennedy Center honors five, including Scorsese|website= Reutgers|date= September 11, 2007|access-date= April 14, 2020|archive-date= December 27, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045217/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kennedycenter/kennedy-center-honors-five-including-scorsese-idUSN1145449620070911|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://walkoffame.com/martin-scorsese/|title= Martin Scorsese|website= walkoffame.com|date= October 25, 2019|access-date= April 15, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191214060335/https://www.walkoffame.com/martin-scorsese|archive-date= December 14, 2019|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[British Film Institute Fellowship]] in 1995, and a [[BAFTA Fellowship]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/04/martin-scorsese-bafta-fellowship-award|title= Martin Scorsese to receive Bafta fellowship award|website= The Guardian|date= January 4, 2012|access-date= April 15, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170523030916/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/04/martin-scorsese-bafta-fellowship-award|archive-date= May 23, 2017|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scorsese is also a recipient of the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an Academy Award, a [[Palme d'Or]], a [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes Film Festival Award]], a [[Silver Lion]], a [[Grammy Award]], three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, three [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]], and two [[Directors Guild of America Award]]s.

As a boy, he had [[asthma]] and could not play sports or take part in any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, Scorsese frequently rented [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. Scorsese was one of only two people who regularly rented it; the other was future film director [[George A. Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/feature/2015-07-08-george-a-romero-talks-zombies-religion-and-genocide-in-karlovy-vary-feature-story-by-richard-mowe |title=Romero – master of the macabre |publisher=Eye for Film |access-date=July 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723173645/http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/feature/2015-07-08-george-a-romero-talks-zombies-religion-and-genocide-in-karlovy-vary-feature-story-by-richard-mowe |archive-date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese has cited [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]] and [[Victor Mature]] as his favorite actors during his youth. He has also spoken of the influence of the 1947–48 Powell and Pressburger films ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'', whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Black-Narcissus-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN4 |title=Black Narcissus (The Criterion Collection) (2001) DVD commentary |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] |access-date=October 27, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104105357/http://www.amazon.com/Black-Narcissus-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN4 |archive-date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his documentary titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', Scorsese said that he was enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, and at least two films of the genre, ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'', appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on [[Italian neorealism]], and commented on how ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' and especially ''[[Paisà]]'' inspired him and influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, ''[[Il Mio Viaggio in Italia]]'' (''My Voyage to Italy''), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Paisan|Paisà]]'', which he first saw on television with his relatives who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, had a significant impact on his life.&lt;ref name="hatchet" /&gt; He acknowledges owing a great debt to the [[French New Wave]] and has stated that "the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/new-wave-cinema-guide/nouvelle-vague-where-to-start.shtml |title=New Wave Film Guide: Nouvelle Vague &amp; International New Wave Cinema – Where to Start |publisher=Newwavefilm.com |access-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113132259/http://www.newwavefilm.com/new-wave-cinema-guide/nouvelle-vague-where-to-start.shtml |archive-date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited filmmakers including [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], and [[Federico Fellini]] as major influences on his career.&lt;ref name="hatchet"&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Ingui |publisher=Hatchet |url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2002/03/04/Arts/Martin.Scorsese.Hits.Dc.Hangs.With.The.Hachet-195598.shtml |title=Martin Scorsese hits DC, hangs with the Hachet |access-date=June 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826214118/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2002/03/04/Arts/Martin.Scorsese.Hits.Dc.Hangs.With.The.Hachet-195598.shtml|archive-date=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raging Bull: A film review |author=Jay Antani |year=2004 |publisher=[[Filmcritic.com]] |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Raging-Bull |access-date=May 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208084836/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Raging-Bull|archive-date=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andre Soares |url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/directors/martin-scorsese-on-michelangelo-antonioni/ |title=Martin Scorsese on Michelangelo Antonioni |publisher=Altfg.com |date=March 19, 2009 |access-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708062952/http://www.altfg.com/blog/directors/martin-scorsese-on-michelangelo-antonioni/ |archive-date=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ingmar Bergman Foundation |url=http://193.10.144.136/page.asp?guid=65BFD29C-045F-4C51-88B1-1A50F6173D26 |title=Ingmar Bergman |publisher=193.10.144.136 |access-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013947/http://193.10.144.136/page.asp?guid=65BFD29C-045F-4C51-88B1-1A50F6173D26 |archive-date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |id=uysS8EHrpB4 |title=Martin Scorsese praises Federico Fellini and 'La Dolce Vita' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
While attending the Tisch School of the Arts, Scorsese made the short films ''[[What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?]]'' (1963) and ''[[It's Not Just You, Murray!]]'' (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic ''[[The Big Shave]]'' (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], suggested by its alternative title ''Viet '67''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Finding the boy again |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |author=Alistair Harkness |date=April 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by film professor [[Haig P. Manoogian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/marchapril/feature/love-and-resolution-appreciation |title="With Love and Resolution": An Appreciation |website=neh.gov |url-status=live |access-date=January 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701161645/https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/marchapril/feature/love-and-resolution-appreciation |archive-date=July 1, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white ''I Call First'', which was later retitled ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'', with his fellow students actor [[Harvey Keitel]] and editor [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semi-autobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which would have included a later film, ''[[Mean Streets]]''. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] saw the film at the 1967 [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and in his review praised Scorsese and the film writing, "I Call First" brings these two kinds of films together into a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-call-first--whos-that-knocking-at-my-door-1967|title= I Call First / Who's That Knocking at My Door?|website= Rogerebert.com|access-date= November 15, 2020|archive-date= December 27, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045136/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-call-first--whos-that-knocking-at-my-door-1967|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Scorsese has avoided comparing his own films to those of other filmmakers whom he considers to be his contemporaries after 1967 when his own career in films began. The single exception is [[Kubrick]]’s 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="BFI2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/1058 |title=Martin Scorsese's Picks for 2012 Sight and Sound Polls |website=Bfi.org.uk |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=August 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223005206/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people//sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/1058 |archive-date=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
Scorsese became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s: [[Brian De Palma]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref name="BANDB"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/06/brian-de-palma-shed-light-on-a-crazy-rumor-about-scorsese-and-taxi-driver/ |title=Brian De Palma Shed Light on a Crazy Rumor About Martin Scorsese and Taxi Driver |last=Maurer |first=Daniel |date=June 9, 2016 |website=bedfordandbowery.com |url-status=live |access-date=January 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111035443/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/06/brian-de-palma-shed-light-on-a-crazy-rumor-about-scorsese-and-taxi-driver/ |archive-date=November 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Adams, Veronika ''Martin Scorsese'' Ebook.GD Publishing ISBN 1-61323-010-9 |isbn=9781613230107 |last1=Adams |first1=Veronika |date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was De Palma who introduced Scorsese to [[Robert De Niro]].&lt;ref name="BANDB"/&gt; During this period, Scorsese worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970) and met actor–director [[John Cassavetes]], who became a close friend and mentor. In 1972, Scorsese made the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era exploiter ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'' for [[B-movie]] producer [[Roger Corman]], who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, [[James Cameron]], and [[John Sayles]] launch their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=The Screen: 'Boxcar Bertha' Tops Local Double Bill |first=Howard |last=Thompson |date=August 18, 1972 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/18/archives/the-screenboxcar-bertha-tops-local-double-bill.html|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029223024/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980CE1DF1631E63BBC4052DFBE668389669EDE |archive-date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with ''Mean Streets''. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.

Championed by influential film critic [[Pauline Kael]], ''Mean Streets'' was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of ''Mean Streets'' was shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, [[Samuel Fuller]] and early [[Jean-Luc Godard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html |title=Scorsese, Master Of The Rage |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 24, 1991 |first=Hal |last=Hinson|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203140433/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html|archive-date=December 3, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, actress [[Ellen Burstyn]] chose Scorsese to direct her in ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with ''[[Italianamerican]]'', a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.

''[[Taxi Driver]]'' followed in 1976—Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's gradual descent into insanity. The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the troubled and psychotic [[Travis Bickle]], and co-starred [[Jodie Foster]] in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, with Harvey Keitel as her pimp. ''Taxi Driver'' also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer [[Paul Schrader]], whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin [[Arthur Bremer]] and ''[[Pickpocket (film)|Pickpocket]]'', a film by the French director [[Robert Bresson]]. Writer–director Schrader often returns to Bresson's work in films such as ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Light Sleeper]]'', and Scorsese's later ''[[Bringing Out the Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thurman |first=John |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/37/taxi_driver/ |title=Citizen Bickle, or the Allusive Taxi Driver: Uses of Intertextuality |publisher=Sensesofcinema.com |date=April 5, 1976 |access-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128221305/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/37/taxi_driver/ |archive-date=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already controversial upon its release, ''Taxi Driver'' hit the headlines again five years later, when [[John Hinckley Jr.]] made an assassination attempt on then-president [[Ronald Reagan]]. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster's ''Taxi Driver'' character (in the film, De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1813797,00.html |title=I was in a bad place |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 6, 2006 |location=London |first=Geoffrey |last=MacNab |access-date=May 12, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720040533/http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0%2C%2C1813797%2C00.html |archive-date=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Festival Archives: Taxi Driver |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2123.html |publisher=Festival de Cannes |access-date=February 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614231841/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2123.html |archive-date=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also receiving four [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The critical and financial success of ''Taxi Driver'' encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]''. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: {{quote|For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2008/01/28/080128gomo_GOAT_movies_brody |title=Top of the Heap |work=[[The New Yorker]] |agency=DVD Notes (column) |date=January 28, 2008 |access-date=July 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124000216/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2008/01/28/080128gomo_GOAT_movies_brody|archive-date=January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1977 he directed the Broadway musical ''[[The Act (musical)|The Act]]'', starring Liza Minnelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bailey |first1=Jason |title=Martin Scorsese's Weirdest Projects – Page 2 |url=http://flavorwire.com/475332/martin-scorseses-weirdest-projects/2 |website=[[Flavorwire]] |access-date=May 17, 2016 |date=September 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616190243/http://flavorwire.com/475332/martin-scorseses-weirdest-projects/2 |archive-date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disappointing reception that ''New York, New York'' received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''.

=== 1980s ===
By several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''. Writing for ''The New Yorker'' in March 2000, [[Mark Singer (journalist)|Mark Singer]] summarized Scorsese's condition stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;He (Scorsese) was more than mildly depressed. Drug abuse, and abuse of his body in general, culminated in a terrifying episode of internal bleeding. Robert De Niro came to see him in the hospital and asked, in so many words, whether he wanted to live or die. If you want to live, De Niro proposed, let's make this picture—referring to ''Raging Bull'', an as-told-to book by [[Jake LaMotta|Jake La Motta]], the former world middleweight boxing champion, that De Niro had given him to read years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Mark (2000).

''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |title=Raging Bull |publisher=Eufs.org.uk |date=March 5, 2001 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430185450/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |archive-date=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.

Although the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and [[Mardik Martin]] (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including [[Jay Cocks]] (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films ''The Age of Innocence'' and ''[[Gangs of New York]]''). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ageing bulls return |newspaper=Observer |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,98151,00.html |date=October 31, 1999 |first=Mark |last=Morris |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111064454/http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0%2C%2C98151%2C00.html |archive-date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] chose ''Raging Bull'' as the number one American sports film on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Sports|their list of the top 10 sports films]]. In 1997, the Institute ranked ''Raging Bull'' as the twenty-fourth greatest film of all time on their [[AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies]] list. In 2007, they ranked ''Raging Bull'' as the fourth greatest film of all time on their [[AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] list.

Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983). It is a [[satire]] on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act ([[kidnapping]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |title=The King of Comedy Film Review |work=Timeout.com |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110220949/http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |archive-date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed previously, often using a static camera and long takes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=evil jimi |url=http://www.ehrensteinland.com/htmls/library/koc.html |title=The King of Comedy |publisher=Ehrensteinland.com |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326054035/http://www.ehrensteinland.com/htmls/library/koc.html |archive-date=March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the expressionism of his previous work gave way to moments of almost total [[surrealism]]. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The ''King of Comedy'' failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director [[Wim Wenders]] numbered it among his 15 favorite films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm |title=The Official Site |publisher=[[Wim Wenders]] |access-date=March 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020618113722/http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm|archive-date=June 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1983, Scorsese made a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Anna Pavlova (film)|Anna Pavlova]]'' (also known as ''A Woman for All Time''), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, [[Michael Powell]]. This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.

With ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), for which he won a [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director|Best Director Award]] at Cannes, Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.

In 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|1955 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |access-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archive-date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archive-date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.

In 1986, Scorsese directed the 18 minute short film ''[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]'' featuring [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Wesley Snipes]] (in his film debut). The short also serves as a music video and was shot in the [[Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station]] in [[Brooklyn]] over a 6-week period during November and December 1986. The short film's cinematographer was frequent Scorsese collaborator [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]]. The dancing and filmmaking was heavily influenced by the 1961 film ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]''. Scorsese also noted the influence of his own film ''[[Taxi Driver (film)|Taxi Driver]]'' (1976) in [[Spike Lee]]'s documentary about the 25th anniversary of the short titled, ''[[Bad 25 (film)|Bad 25]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA3TasRXh8U|title= Michael Jackson – Making Of Bad (BAD 25) Documentary|website= [[YouTube]]|access-date= November 26, 2020|archive-date= November 21, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201121011538/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA3TasRXh8U|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short has been praised by critics as one of the most iconic and greatest videos of all time; Jackson's outfit has been cited as an influence on fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7949240/michael-jackson-bad-interviews-quincy-jones-welsey-snipes|title=Michael Jackson's 'Bad': Quincy Jones, Wesley Snipes &amp; Other Collaborators Tell the Stories of the Album's Five No. 1 Singles|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-11-06|archive-date=December 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045128/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7949240/michael-jackson-bad-interviews-quincy-jones-welsey-snipes|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/review/108840/from-the-record-crate-michael-jackson-bad-1987/|title=From the Record Crate: Michael Jackson – "Bad" (1987) {{!}} The Young Folks|date=2017-08-31|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upscalehype.com/2018/09/how-michael-jacksons-bad-music-video-influenced-fashion/|title=How Michael Jackson's 'BAD' Music Video Influenced Fashion|date=2018-09-05|website=UpscaleHype|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-06|archive-date=December 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045131/http://www.upscalehype.com/2018/09/how-michael-jacksons-bad-music-video-influenced-fashion/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called "Life Lessons". [[Roger Ebert]]'s gave the film a mixed review, while praising Scorsese's short as "really successful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/new-york-stories-1989|title= New York Stories|website= Rogerebert.com|access-date= November 26, 2020|archive-date= December 27, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045146/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/new-york-stories-1989|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
After a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' "the best mob movie ever". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archive-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=March 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archive-date=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archive-date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won many other awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more. The American Film Institute placed ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').

[[File:La generación del 70.jpg|thumb|Scorsese, [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[George Lucas]]]]
In 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: ''[[Made in Milan]]'' about fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]]. The following year brought ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1.

In 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' is remembered for the telling line: "You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money." De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa |title=Films produced by De Fina-Cappa |work=[[Letterboxd]] |access-date=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011625/http://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa/ |archive-date=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy (1995 film)|Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).

[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]

''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.

Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (''The Leopard'') as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]]'' (''The Taking of Power by Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV''). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''. This was Scorsese's first film to be shot on Super 35 format.

''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,&lt;ref name="variety-gross"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archive-date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it received generally positive notices from critics. Comparisons were drawn to his earlier film ''Goodfellas'', and Scorsese admitted ''Casino'' bore a superficial resemblance to it, but he maintained that the story was significantly larger in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016|title=Beyond The Frame: Casino|url=https://ascmag.com/articles/beyond-the-frame-casino-1995|access-date=2020-11-01|website=[[American Cinematographer]]|archive-date=December 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201227045146/https://ascmag.com/articles/beyond-the-frame-casino-1995|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.

Scorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, "I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries." In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the "Director's Dilemma", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of "making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself."

If ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archive-date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.

''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |access-date=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archive-date=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like earlier Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recall the films of Robert Bresson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archive-date=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

On various occasions Scorsese has been asked to present the [[Honorary Academy Award]] during the Oscar telecast.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Leo Scor Diaz(GangsofNY)-.jpg|thumb|At the ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' screening at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Cameron Diaz]]]]

In 1999, Scorsese produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers titled ''Il Mio Viaggio in Italia'', also known as ''[[My Voyage to Italy]]''. The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecittà]] film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with [[Miramax]] boss [[Harvey Weinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,860378,00.html |title=Gangs of Los Angeles |work=The Guardian |date=December 15, 2002 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111091503/http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0%2C%2C860378%2C00.html |archive-date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite denials of artistic compromise, some felt that ''Gangs of New York'' was the director's most conventional film, featuring standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] purposes and explanatory [[flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]].&lt;ref name="guardian_film_of_the_week"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Peter Bradshaw |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,871400,00.html |title=Gangs of New York |work=The Guardian |date=January 10, 2003 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111091432/http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0%2C%2C871400%2C00.html |archive-date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epinions.com/content_136317079172 |title=Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Gangs of New York at |publisher=Epinions.com |date=July 1, 2003 |access-date=March 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012014134/http://epinions.com/content_136317079172|archive-date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Xan Brooks |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,871715,00.html |title=Past master |work=The Guardian |date=January 9, 2003 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111091447/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0%2C%2C871715%2C00.html |archive-date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes long.&lt;ref name="guardian_film_of_the_week" /&gt; Even so, the film received generally positive reviews with the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reporting that 75 percent of the reviews for the film they tallied were positive and summarizing the critics writing, "Though flawed, the sprawling, messy ''Gangs of New York'' is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/ |title=Gangs of New York |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013039/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/ |archive-date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's central themes are consistent with the director's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film until its release in the [[Oscar season]] of late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,680795,00.html |title=In briefs: Gangs of New York release delayed again |work=The Guardian |date=April 8, 2002 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111064545/http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0%2C%2C680795%2C00.html |archive-date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gangs of New York'' earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, ''Gangs of New York'' received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis; however, it did not win in any category.

The following year, Scorsese completed production of ''[[The Blues (film)|The Blues]]'', an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Mike Figgis]], and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled ''Feel Like Going Home''). In the early 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for up-and-coming directors, such as ''[[You Can Count on Me]]'' (directed by [[Kenneth Lonergan]]), ''Rain'' (directed by Katherine Lindberg), ''[[Lymelife]]'' (directed by [[Derick Martini]]) and ''[[The Young Victoria]]'' (directed by [[Jean-Marc Vallée]]). At that time, he established [[Sikelia Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/exec/martin-scorsese |title=Martin Scorsese |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=September 3, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054732/http://variety.com/exec/martin-scorsese/ |archive-date=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, producer [[Emma Tillinger Koskoff]] joined the company.&lt;ref name="SD"&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/tillinger-named-production-president-at-scorseses-sikelia/4027253.article Tillinger named production president at Scorsese's Sikelia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224143634/http://www.screendaily.com/tillinger-named-production-president-at-scorseses-sikelia/4027253.article |date=February 24, 2014 }}, screendaily.com, retrieved February 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Scorsese also produced several documentaries, such as ''[[The Soul of a Man]]'' (directed by Wim Wenders) and ''Lightning in a Bottle'' (directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]]).

''The Aviator'' was nominated for six [[Golden Globe awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture-Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama]] for Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture-Drama and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005 ''The Aviator'' became the most-nominated film of the [[77th Academy Awards]] nominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese. Despite having the most nominations, the film won only five Oscars. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood for ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (which also won Best Picture).

''[[No Direction Home]]'' is a documentary film by Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and the culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-[[Electric Dylan controversy|controversial transformation]] from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his "retirement" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the [[BBC Two]] ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released the same month. The film won a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]]. In addition, Scorsese received an [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nomination for it.

Scorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thriller ''The Departed'', based on the Hong Kong police drama ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' (which is co-directed by [[Andrew Lau]] and [[Alan Mak (director)|Alan Mak]]). The film continued Scorsese's collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio and was the first time he worked with [[Matt Damon]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], and [[Martin Sheen]].

''The Departed'' earned Scorsese a second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his first [[Directors Guild of America]] Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director.

== Filmmaking style and technique ==
Several recurring filmmaking techniques are identifiable in many of Scorsese's films. He has established a filmmaking history which involves repeat collaborations with actors, screenwriters, film editors, and cinematographers, sometimes extending over several decades, such as that with recurring cinematographers Michael Ballhaus, Robert Richardson, and Rodrigo Prieto.

===Slow motion and freeze frame===
Scorsese is known for his frequent use of slow motion, for example, in ''Who's That Knocking at My Door'' (1967) and ''Mean Streets'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/scorsese/ Martin Scorsese] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225033838/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/scorsese/ |date=December 25, 2010 }} by Marc Raymond, ''Senses of Cinema'' (online), May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for using [[freeze frame shot|freeze frames]], such as: in the opening credits of ''The King of Comedy'' (1983), throughout ''Goodfellas'' (1990), ''Casino'' (1995), ''The Departed'' (2006), and in ''The Irishman'' (2019). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion—[[Cybill Shepherd]] in ''Taxi Driver''; [[Cathy Moriarty]]'s white bikini in ''Raging Bull''; Sharon Stone's white minidress in ''Casino''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070513035400/http://www.frankiesfilms.com/html/martin_scorsese.html Martin Scorsese], ''Frankie's Films'' (online), January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/hitch/tour8.html |title=Hitchcock and Women |publisher=Screenonline.org.uk |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211013832/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/hitch/tour8.html |archive-date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scorsese often uses long tracking shots,&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jake |last=Coyle |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/29/atonement_brings_the_long_tracking_shot_back_into_focus/?page=1 |title="Atonement" brings the long tracking shot back into focus |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=December 29, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203044006/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/29/atonement_brings_the_long_tracking_shot_back_into_focus/?page=1 |archive-date=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Taxi Driver'', ''Goodfellas'', ''Casino'', ''Gangs of New York'', and ''Hugo''. [[MOS (film)|MOS]] sequences set to popular music or voice-over are regularly seen in his films, often involving aggressive camera movement and/or rapid editing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/martin_scorseses_comfortable_state_of_anxiety_3290/ Martin Scorsese's Comfortable State of Anxiety] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20121217163916/https://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/martin_scorseses_comfortable_state_of_anxiety_3290/ |date=December 17, 2012 }}, by Timothy Rhys, ''[[MovieMaker Magazine]]'' (online), October 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s [[silent film]] cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in ''Casino'' (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), ''Life Lessons'', ''The Departed'' (on Matt Damon), and ''Hugo''. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', ''[[The Searchers]]'', and ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]''. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song "[[Gimme Shelter]]" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese's films: ''Goodfellas'', ''Casino'', and ''The Departed''.

===Cameo appearances===
Scorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Boxcar Bertha'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'', ''Taxi Driver'', ''The King of Comedy'', ''After Hours'', ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' (albeit hidden under a hood), ''The Age of Innocence'', ''Gangs of New York'', ''Hugo''), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in ''The Aviator'' and ''The Wolf of Wall Street''). In ''The Age of Innocence'', for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of a [[large format]] portrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration in ''Mean Streets'' and ''The Color of Money''; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of ''Raging Bull'', and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in ''Bringing Out the Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html Most Famous Film Director Cameos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510072224/http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html |date=May 10, 2008 }} by Tim Dirks, [[Filmsite.org]] (online), 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedy ''[[In the Pope's Eye]]''.

===Religious guilt===
Guilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Raging Bull'', ''Bringing Out the Dead'', ''The Departed'', ''Shutter Island'', and ''The Irishman''). In a similar manner, Scorsese considered ''Silence'' a "passion project": it had been in development since 1990, two years after the release of his film ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', which also contained strongly religious themes.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/silence-release-date-us-uk-martin-scorsese-liam-neeson-oscars-2017-adam-driver-andrew-garfield-a7332221.html Silence release date sets Martin Scorsese's passion project up for Oscars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020834/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/silence-release-date-us-uk-martin-scorsese-liam-neeson-oscars-2017-adam-driver-andrew-garfield-a7332221.html |date=December 1, 2016 }}". ''The Independent.'' September 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he retained interest in a project dealing with strong theological themes for over 26 years, Scorsese said,&lt;blockquote&gt;As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more&amp;nbsp;... ''Silence'' is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done&amp;nbsp;... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions.&lt;ref name="Emmett Furla"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/04/martin-scorsese-to-make-noise-on-silence-at-cannes-emmettfurla-films-funding-the-film-479101 |title=Martin Scorsese to Make Noise on 'Silence' at Cannes; Emmett/Furla Funding The Film |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=April 19, 2013 |access-date=January 16, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219231833/http://deadline.com/2013/04/martin-scorsese-to-make-noise-on-silence-at-cannes-emmettfurla-films-funding-the-film-479101/ |archive-date=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Political corruption===
More recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in ''The Departed''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/11/revisiting_southies_culture_of_death/ "Revisiting Southie's culture of death"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202061132/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/11/revisiting_southies_culture_of_death/ |date=February 2, 2009 }}, Michael Patrick MacDonald, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (online), October 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and politicians in ''Gangs of New York''&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021220/REVIEWS/212200304/1023 "Gangs of New York Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023005939/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20021220%2FREVIEWS%2F212200304%2F1023 |date=October 23, 2009 }}, [[Roger Ebert]], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (online), December 20, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Aviator''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/12/20/041220crci_cinema "High Rollers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616114916/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/12/20/041220crci_cinema |date=June 16, 2008 }}, David Denby, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (online), December 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his liberal usage of profanity, dark humor, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wthr.com/story/5515074/martin-scorsese-retrospective |title=Martin Scorsese Retrospective |date=October 9, 2006 |work=wthr.com |access-date=February 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429090833/http://www.wthr.com/story/5515074/martin-scorsese-retrospective |archive-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese's interest in political corruption as depicted in his films was expanded further in his 2019 film ''The Irishman''. [[Richard Brody]] writing for ''The New Yorker'' found the main interpretation of the film to be a dark allegory of a realist reading of American politics and American society stating:&lt;blockquote&gt; The real-life Hoffa... (was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. ''The Irishman'' is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society—from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics—is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.&lt;ref&gt;"Watching ''The Irishman'' on Netflix Is the Best Way to See It." By Richard Brody. December 2, 2019. ''The New Yorker''.

Scorsese often casts the same actors in his projects, particularly Robert De Niro, who has collaborated with Scorsese on nine feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (''Taxi Driver'', ''Raging Bull'', and ''Goodfellas'') that made AFI's 100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in ''The King of Comedy''. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating on five feature films and one short to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.go.com/moviesproxy/tipster?id=922715 |title=Leo &amp; Marty: Yes, Again! |publisher=Movies.go.com |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401160435/http://movies.go.com/moviesproxy/tipster?id=922715 |archive-date=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.net/martin-scorsese/news/martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-introduced-me-to-leonardo-dicaprio_6275540 |title=Scorsese Likens DiCaprio To De Niro |access-date=June 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502000140/http://www.contactmusic.net/martin-scorsese/news/martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-introduced-me-to-leonardo-dicaprio_6275540 |archive-date=May 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20164049,00.html |title=Successful Hollywood Duos |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 30, 2007 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703225354/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20164049%2C00.html |archive-date=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent collaborators also include: [[Victor Argo]] (6), Harvey Keitel (6), [[Harry Northup]] (6), Murray Moston (5), [[Illeana Douglas]] (4), [[J.

== Personal life ==
In 1965, Scorsese married his first wife Laraine Marie Brennan, and they remained together for six years between 1965 and 1971; they have a daughter, Catherine, who was named after his mother.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Scorsese begs public for $30K to fix flooded Brooklyn apartment", by Dean Balsamini and Sara Dorn, ''PageSix'', May 25, 2019.

Blake, Loyola Press, 2000, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Scorsese identified himself as a Catholic again, saying, "my way has been, and is, Catholicism. After many years of thinking about other things, dabbling here and there, I am most comfortable as a Catholic.

In 1976, Scorsese married the writer [[Julia Cameron]], his second marriage; they have a daughter ([[Domenica Cameron-Scorsese]], who is an actress and appeared in ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]''), but the marriage lasted only a year. The divorce was acrimonious and served as the basis of Cameron's first feature, the dark comedy ''God's Will'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=God's Will (1989) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/163155/God-s-Will/overview |access-date=April 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423023314/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/163155/God-s-Will/overview |department=Movies &amp; TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Clarke Fountain |date=2014 |archive-date=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also starred their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/martinscorsese0000keys/page/188 |author=Keyser, Les |title=Twayne's Filmmakers Series: Martin Scorsese |publisher=[[Twayne Publishers]]: New York |year=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/martinscorsese0000keys/page/188 188] |isbn=978-0-8057-9321-5 |access-date=February 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="success"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Piccalo |first=Gina |title=Agonizing success of 'Artist's Way' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 23, 2006 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/23/entertainment/et-cameron23 |access-date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122116/http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/23/entertainment/et-cameron23 |archive-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a small role in ''Cape Fear'' using the name Domenica Scorsese and has continued to act, write, direct, and produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malkin |first=Marc |title=Scorsese's Family Business |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/59163/scorsese-s-family-business |publisher=[[E!]] |access-date=April 18, 2014 |date=April 16, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420231140/http://www.eonline.com/news/59163/scorsese-s-family-business |archive-date=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years, divorcing in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini – Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archive-date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorsese married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; they divorced in 1991. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese was romantically involved with actress [[Illeana Douglas]] following his fourth divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jewel|first=Dan|date=March 1, 1999|title=Note Worthy|url=https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225552/https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/|archive-date=October 25, 2018|access-date=October 25, 2018|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The African Film Heritage Project ===
In 2017, Scorsese also introduced The African Film Heritage Project (AFHP), which is a joint initiative between Scorsese's non-profit [[The Film Foundation]], [[UNESCO]], [[Cineteca di Bologna]], and the [[Pan African Federation of Filmmakers]] (FEPACI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/10/africa/martin-scorsese-african-film-heritage-project-unesco-fepaci/index.html|title= Martin Scorsese leads effort to save lost African cinema|website= CNN|access-date= April 7, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229064144/https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/10/africa/martin-scorsese-african-film-heritage-project-unesco-fepaci/index.html|archive-date= February 29, 2020|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to locate and preserve 50 classic African films, some thought lost and others beyond repair, with hopes to make them available to audiences everywhere. In an interview with ''Cinema Escapist'' in 2018, Scorsese talked about the ambitious collaboration saying, "Our first goal is to launch and conduct a thorough investigation in film archives and laboratories around the world, in order to locate the best surviving elements—original negatives, we hope—for our first 50 titles."&lt;ref name="film-foundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.film-foundation.org/cinema-escapist|title= MARTIN SCORSESE ON THE AFRICAN FILM HERITAGE PROJECT|website= The Film Foundation|access-date= April 7, 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200115165004/http://www.film-foundation.org/cinema-escapist|archive-date= January 15, 2020|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "Restoration is always the primary goal, of course, but within the initiative, it’s also a starting point of a process that follows through with exhibition and dissemination in Africa and abroad. And of course, our restoration process always includes the creation of preservation elements."&lt;ref name="film-foundation.org"/&gt;

In 2019, the AFHP, announced that they would screen restorations of four African films on their home continent for the first time as part of the 50th anniversary of the [[Pan African Film Festival]] of [[Ouagadougou]]. The movies in question are [[Med Hondo]]’s ''[[Soleil Ô]]'' (1970), [[Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina]]’s ''[[Chronique des années de braise]]'' (1975), [[Timité Bassori]]’s ''La Femme au couteau'' (1969), and [[Jean-Pierre Dikongue-Pipa]]’s ''[[Muna Moto]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="indiewire.com"/&gt;
