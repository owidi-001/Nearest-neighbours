Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]] to [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms such as [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s. These various organisms contribute to the [[biodiversity]] of an [[ecosystem]], where they play specialized roles in the [[Biogeochemical cycle | cycling]] of [[nutrient]]s and [[energy]].

==Etymology==
''Biology'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words of {{lang|grc|βίος}} [[romanized]] {{transl|grc|bíos}} meaning 'life' and -{{lang|grc|λογία}}; romanized -{{transl|grc|logía}} meaning 'branch of study' or 'to speak'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |title=Who coined the term biology? |work=Info.com |access-date=2012-06-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509211839/http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |archive-date=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict_biology&gt;{{cite web | title=biology | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307163258/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | archive-date=2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those combined make the Greek word {{lang|grc|βιολογία}} romanized {{transl|grc|biología}} meaning 'biology'. Despite this, the term {{lang|grc|βιολογία}} as a whole didn't exist in Ancient Greek. The first to borrow it was the English and French ({{lang|fr|biologie}}). Historically there was another term for ''biology'' in English, [[wikt:lifelore|lifelore]]; it is rarely used today.

The Latin-language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] ({{lang|sv|Carl von Linné}}) used {{lang|sv|biologi}} in his {{lang|sv|[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]}}. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled {{lang|la|Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis}}, by [[Michael Christoph Hanow|Michael Christoph Hanov]], a disciple of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. The first German use, {{lang|de|Biologie}}, was in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in the preface of a book, {{lang|de|Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft}}. [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective ({{lang|de|Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst}}). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise {{lang|de|Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur}} (1802–22) by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]], who announced:&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Robert J. |title=The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn= 978-0-226-71210-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7N4_i7vrTUC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been affected. The [[science]] that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [{{lang|de|Biologie}}] or the doctrine of life [{{lang|de|Lebenslehre}}].

The earliest of roots of [[science]], which included [[medicine]], can be traced to [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] in around 3000 to 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name= "Lindberg1"&gt;{{cite book | last= Lindberg | first= David C. | year = 2007 | chapter = Science before the Greeks | title= The beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context | pages = 1–20 | edition = Second | location = Chicago, Illinois | publisher = University of Chicago Press | isbn= 978-0-226-48205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Grant2007a"&gt;{{cite book | last= Grant| first= Edward | year = 2007 | chapter = Ancient Egypt to Plato | title= A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century | url= https://archive.org/details/historynaturalph00gran| url-access= limited| pages = [https://archive.org/details/historynaturalph00gran/page/n16 1]–26 | edition = First | location = New York, New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn= 978-052-1-68957-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contributions later entered and shaped Greek [[natural philosophy]] of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name= "Lindberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Grant2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magner|first=Lois N.|title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-91100-6|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|archive-date=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anthony | last=Serafini |title=The Epic History of Biology |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3oECAAAQBAJ&amp;q=biology%20egypt&amp;pg=PA2|access-date=14 July 2015| isbn=978-1-4899-6327-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. His works such as ''[[History of Animals]]'' were especially important because they revealed his naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on [[botany]] that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic world]] who wrote on biology included [[al-Jahiz]] (781–869), [[Al-Dīnawarī]] (828–896), who wrote on botany,&lt;ref name="Fahd-815"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fahd | first=Toufic |contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815|editor-last1=Morelon |editor-first1=Régis |editor-last2=Rashed |editor-first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=978-0-415-12410-2| title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (865–925) who wrote on [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. [[Medicine]] was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.

Biology began to quickly develop and grow with [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvement of the [[microscope]]. It was then that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic [[dissection]] and [[staining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |pages=133–44 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |archive-date=2015-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Then, in 1838, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jan | last=Sapp | author-link=Jan Sapp | year=2003 | title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology | chapter=7 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-19-515618-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=William | year=1977 | title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century: Problems of Form, Function, and Transformation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-29293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. [[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Although he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Darwin aged 51.jpg|thumb|In 1842, [[Charles Darwin]] penned his first sketch of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1909|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="Gould 2002 187"&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]]. ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-674-00613-5}}. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.&lt;ref name=Lam1914&gt;[[#Lamarck1914|Lamarck (1914)]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], the uniformitarian geology of [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]], [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar reasoning and evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: "Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent"; and chapter 11: "The causation of evolution: natural selection"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |title=Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-58836-538-5 |chapter=Ch. 3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324124009/http://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |archive-date=2015-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.

The basis for modern genetics began with the work of [[Gregor Mendel]], who presented his paper, "''Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden''" ("[[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]]"), in 1865,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henig|url=http://archive.org/details/monkingardenlost00heni|title=Op. cit|date=2000|pages=134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlined the principles of biological inheritance, serving as the basis for modern genetics.&lt;ref name = "miko2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miko | first = Ilona | title = Gregor Mendel's principles of inheritance form the cornerstone of modern genetics. So just what are they? | journal = Nature Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 134 | date = 2008 | url = https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/gregor-mendel-and-the-principles-of-inheritance-593/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] reconciled Darwinian evolution with [[classical genetics]].&lt;ref name="Futuyma2017a"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Futuyma | first1 = Douglas J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = Mark | date = 2017| pages=3–26 | chapter = Evolutionary Biology | title = Evolution | edition = 4th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | location = Sunderland, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and early 1950s, a [[Hershey–Chase experiment|series of experiments]] by [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] pointed to [[DNA]] as the component of [[chromosomes]] that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as [[genes]]. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]], along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]]. From the 1950s to the present times, biology has been vastly extended in the [[Molecular Biology|molecular]] domain. The [[genetic code]] was cracked by [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] after DNA was understood to contain [[codons]]. Finally, the [[Human Genome Project]] was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human [[genome]]. This project was essentially completed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | title=Human genome finally complete | access-date=2006-07-22 | date=2003-04-14 | work=BBC News | first=Ivan | last=Noble | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | archive-date=2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.

The smallest unit of an element is an [[atom]], which is composed of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more [[electron]]s bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more [[proton]]s and a number of [[neutron]]s. Individual atoms can be held together by [[chemical bond]]s to form [[molecule]]s and ionic compounds.&lt;ref name = "urry2017b"/&gt; Common types of chemical bonds include [[ionic bond]]s, [[covalent bond]]s, and [[hydrogen bond]]s. Ionic bonding involves the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic attraction]] between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, or between two [[atoms]] with sharply different [[electronegativities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.IT07058|doi = 10.1351/goldbook.IT07058|chapter = Ionic bond|title = IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-9678550-9-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. Ions are atoms (or groups of atoms) with an electrostatic charge. Atoms that gain electrons make negatively charged ions (called [[anion]]s) whereas those that lose electrons make positively charged ions (called [[cations]]). 

Unlike ionic bonds, a [[covalent bond]] involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share [[electron]]s, is known as covalent bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first2= Brad|last2= Williamson|first3= Robin J.|last3= Heyden| last1 = Campbell| first1 = Neil A.| title = Biology: Exploring Life| url = http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| access-date = 2012-02-05| year = 2006| publisher =| location = Boston | isbn = 0-13-250882-6 }}{{better source needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A hydrogen bond is primarily an [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] force of attraction between a [[hydrogen]] atom which is covalently bound to a more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] atom or group such as oxygen. A ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between [[water]] molecules. In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Two molecules of [[water]] can form a hydrogen bond between them. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule.

====Organic compounds====

[[Image:Glucose Haworth.png|thumb|right|Organic compounds such as [[glucose]] are vital to organisms]]
With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.&lt;ref name = "freeman2017b"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freeman| first1 = Scott | last2 = Quillin | first2 = Kim | last3 = Allison | first3 = Lizabeth | last4 = Black | first4 = Michael |  last5 = Podgorski | first5 = Greg | last6 = Taylor | first6 = Emily | last7 = Carmichael | first7 = Jeff | chapter = Water and carbon: The chemical basis of life | title = Biological Science | publisher = Pearson | edition = 6th | date = 2017 | location = Hoboken, N.J. | pages = 55–77 | isbn = 978-0321976499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "urry2017d"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Urry | first1 = Lisa | last2 = Cain | first2 = Michael | last3 = Wasserman | first3 =  Steven | last4 = Minorsky | first4 = Peter |  last5 = Reece | first5 = Jane | chapter = Molecular diversity of life | title = Campbell Biology | publisher = Pearson | edition = 11th | date = 2017 | location = New York | pages = 56–65 | isbn = 978-0134093413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting [[carbon–carbon bond]]s, which are strong and stable. The simplest form of an organic molecule is the [[hydrocarbon]], which is a large family of [[organic compound]]s that are composed of [[hydrogen]] atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms. When combined with other elements such as [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]], carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds such as [[sugar]]s, [[fat]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[nucleotide]]s.

====Macromolecules====

[[File:225 Peptide Bond-01.jpg | thumb |The (a) primary, (b) secondary, (c) tertiary, and (d) quaternary structures of a [[hemoglobin]] protein.]]
Molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides can act as single repeating units called [[monomer]]s to form chain-like molecules called [[polymer]]s via a chemical process called [[condensation reaction | condensation]].&lt;ref name = "urry2017e"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Urry | first1 = Lisa | last2 = Cain | first2 = Michael | last3 = Wasserman | first3 =  Steven | last4 = Minorsky | first4 = Peter |  last5 = Reece | first5 = Jane | chapter = The structure and function of large biological molecules | title = Campbell Biology | publisher = Pearson | edition = 11th | date = 2017 | location = New York | pages = 66–92 | isbn = 978-0134093413}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, amino acids can form [[peptide | polypeptide]]s whereas nucleotides can form strands of [[DNA | deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]] or [[RNA | ribonucleic acid (RNA)]]. Polymers make up three of the four [[macromolecule]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s) that are found in all organisms. Each macromolecule plays a specialized role within any given cell. Some polysaccharides, for instance, can function as storage material that can be [[hydrolysis | hydrolyzed]] to provide cells with sugar. Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers and the most biologically important lipids are [[fat]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, and [[steroid]]s.&lt;ref name = "urry2017e"/&gt; Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules, which include [[enzyme]]s, [[transport protein]]s, large [[cell signal|signaling]] molecules, [[antibodies]], and [[structural proteins]]. Finally, nucleic acids store, transmit, and express hereditary information.&lt;ref name = "urry2017e"/&gt;

===Cells===
{{Further|Cell biology}}
[[Cell theory]] states that [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through [[cell division]].&lt;ref name = "mazzarello1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mazzarello, P | title=A unifying concept: the history of cell theory | journal=Nature Cell Biology | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=E13–15 | date=May 1999 | pmid=10559875 | doi=10.1038/8964| s2cid=7338204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|micrometer]]s and are therefore only visible under a [[light microscope | light]] or [[electron microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|title=Biology: Exploring Life|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.| first2 = Brad | last2 = Williamson| first3 = Robin J. | last3 = Heyden | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|isbn=9780132508827|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally two types of cells: [[eukaryotic]] cells, which contain a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and [[prokaryotic]] cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]] such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or [[multicellular organism|multicellular]]. In [[multicellular organisms]], every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a [[zygote|single cell]] in a fertilized [[egg (biology)|egg]].

====Cell structure====
[[File:biological cell.svg|thumb|right|Structure of an animal [[cell (biology)|cell]] depicting various [[organelle]]s]]
Every cell is enclosed within a [[cell membrane]] that separates its [[cytoplasm]] from the [[extracellular space]].&lt;ref name = "urry2017g"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Urry | first1 = Lisa | last2 = Cain | first2 = Michael | last3 = Wasserman | first3 =  Steven | last4 = Minorsky | first4 = Peter |  last5 = Reece | first5 = Jane | chapter = Membrane structure and function | title = Campbell Biology | publisher = Pearson | edition = 11th | date = 2017 | location = New York | pages = 126–142 | isbn = 978-0134093413}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cell membrane consists of a [[lipid bilayer]], including [[cholesterol]]s that sit between [[phospholipid]]s to maintain their [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]] at various temperatures. Cell membranes are [[semipermeable membrane|semipermeable]], allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as [[ion]]s.&lt;ref name="MBOC"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/?term=Molecular%20Biology%20of%20the%20Cell|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J|publisher=Garland Science|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3|edition=4th|location=New York|display-authors=etal|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220092628/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/?term=Molecular%20Biology%20of%20the%20Cell|archive-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell membranes also contains [[membrane protein]]s, including [[integral membrane protein]]s that go across the membrane serving as [[membrane transporter]]s, and [[peripheral protein]]s that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as [[enzyme]]s shaping the cell.&lt;ref name="Tom Herrmann 2019"&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Tom Herrmann |author2=Sandeep Sharma | journal=StatPearls | date=March 2, 2019 &lt;!-- | location=1 SIU School of Medicine 2 Baptist Regional Medical Center--&gt; | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538211/ | pmid=30855799 | title=Physiology, Membrane }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as [[cell adhesion]], [[membrane potential|storing electrical energy]], and [[cell signalling]] and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a [[cell wall]], [[glycocalyx]], and [[cytoskeleton]]. 

[[File:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|left|Structure of a plant cell]]
Within the [[cytoplasm]] of a cell, there are many [[biomolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="Alberts2002"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26863/ Cell Movements and the Shaping of the Vertebrate Body] in Chapter 21 of ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/ Molecular Biology of the Cell]'' fourth edition, edited by Bruce Alberts (2002) published by Garland Science.&lt;br /&gt; The Alberts text discusses how the "cellular building blocks" move to shape developing [[embryo]]s. It is also common to describe small molecules such as [[amino acid]]s as "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=%22all+cells%22+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+372023%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4.section.4#23 molecular building blocks]".&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called [[organelle]]s that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units. These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains a cell's genetic information, or [[mitochondrion | mitochondria]], which generates [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by [[lysosome]]s, another specialized organelle. [[Plant cell]]s have additional organelles that distinguish them from [[animal cell]]s such as a [[cell wall]], [[chloroplast]]s, and [[vacuole]].

====Metabolism====
{{Further | Bioenergetics}}
[[File:Activation2 updated.svg|right|thumb|Example of an enzyme-catalysed [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic]] reaction]]
All cells require [[energy]] to sustain cellular processes. Energy is the capacity to do [[Work (physics)|work]], which, in [[thermodynamics]], can be calculated using [[Gibbs free energy]]. According to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], energy is [[Conservation law|conserved]], i.e., cannot be created or destroyed. Hence, [[chemical reaction]]s in a cell do not create new energy but are involved instead in the transformation and transfer of energy.&lt;ref name = "freeman2017h"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freeman| first1 = Scott | last2 = Quillin | first2 = Kim | last3 = Allison | first3 = Lizabeth | last4 = Black | first4 = Michael |  last5 = Podgorski | first5 = Greg | last6 = Taylor | first6 = Emily | last7 = Carmichael | first7 = Jeff | chapter = Energy and enzymes: An introduction to metabolism | title = Biological Science | publisher = Pearson | edition = 6th | date = 2017 | location = Hoboken, N.J. | pages = 171–188 | isbn = 978-0321976499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all energy transfers lead to some loss of usable energy, which increases [[entropy]] (or state of disorder) as stated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. As a result, an organism requires continuous input of energy to maintain a low state of entropy. In cells, energy can be transferred as electrons during [[Redox|redox (reduction–oxidation)]] reactions, stored in covalent bonds, and generated by the movement of ions (e.g., hydrogen, sodium, potassium) across a membrane.

[[Metabolism]] is the set of [[life]]-sustaining [[chemical reactions]] in [[organisms]]. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to [[energy]] to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, and some [[carbohydrate]]s; and the elimination of [[metabolic waste]]s. These [[enzyme]]-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as [[catabolic]] – the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by [[cellular respiration]]); or [[anabolic]] – the building up ([[biosynthesis|synthesis]]) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy.

The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into [[metabolic pathway]]s, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific [[enzyme]]. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require [[energy]] that will not occur by themselves, by [[Coupling (physics)|coupling]] them to [[spontaneous process|spontaneous reactions]] that release energy. Enzymes act as [[Catalysis|catalysts]] – they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it – by reducing the amount of [[activation energy]] needed to convert [[reactant]]s into [[Product (chemistry) | product]]s. Enzymes also allow the [[Metabolic pathway#Regulation|regulation]] of the rate of a  metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the [[cell (biology)|cell's]] environment or to [[cell signaling|signals]] from other cells.

====Cellular respiration====
[[Image:CellRespiration.svg|thumb|right|300px|Respiration in a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cell]]]]
[[Cellular respiration]] is a set of [[metabolism|metabolic]] reactions and processes that take place in the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of [[organism]]s to convert [[Energy#Energy and life|chemical energy]] from [[nutrients]] into [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and then release waste products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Regina|title=Cellular Respiration|url=http://biology.about.com/od/cellularprocesses/a/cellrespiration.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505043947/http://biology.about.com/od/cellularprocesses/a/cellrespiration.htm|archive-date=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions involved in respiration are [[catabolism|catabolic reactions]], which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy because weak high-energy bonds, in particular in [[molecular oxygen]],&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt; Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2015). "Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;", ''J. Chem. Educ.'' '''92''': 2094-2099.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 &lt;/ref&gt; are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are [[redox]] reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a [[combustion reaction]], it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.

Sugar in the form of [[glucose]] is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: [[glycolysis]], [[citric acid cycle]] (or Krebs cycle), [[electron transport chain]], and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name = "lodish2008l"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lodish | first1 = Harvey | last2 = Berk | first2 = Arnold. | last3 = Kaiser | first3 =  Chris A.  | last4 = Krieger | first4 = Monty | last5 = Scott | first5 = Matthew P. | last6 = Bretscher | first6 = Anthony | last7 = Ploegh | first7 = Hidde | last8 = Matsudaira | first8 = Paul | chapter = Cellular energetics | title = Molecular Cell Biology | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company | edition = 6th | date = 2008 | location = New York | pages = 479–532 | isbn = 978-0716776017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two [[pyruvic acid | pyruvate]]s, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.&lt;ref name = "lodish2008l"/&gt; Each pyruvate is then oxidized into [[acetyl-CoA]] by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]], which also generates NADH and carbon dioxide. Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the [[Crista|mitochondrial cristae]]. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the [[electron transport chain]], which is a series of four [[protein complex]]es that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane ([[chemiosmosis]]), which generates a [[Chemiosmosis#Proton-motive force|proton motive force]].&lt;ref name = "lodish2008l"/&gt; Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme [[ATP synthase]] to synthesize more ATPs by [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]s. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final [[electron acceptor]].

If oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of [[fermentation]]. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to [[cellular waste product|waste products]] that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; so it can be re-used in glycolysis.  In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for glycolysis.  This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is [[lactic acid]]. This type of fermentation is called [[lactic acid fermentation]]. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or [[ethanol fermentation]]. The ATP generated in this process is made by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]], which does not require oxygen.

====Photosynthesis====
[[File:Simple photosynthesis overview.svg|thumb|Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and fixes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into sugar.]]
[[Photosynthesis]] is a process used by plants and other organisms to [[Energy transformation|convert]] [[light energy]] into [[chemical energy]] that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via [[cellular respiration]]. This chemical energy is stored in [[carbohydrate]] molecules, such as [[sugar]]s, which are synthesized from [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]].&lt;ref name="OnlineEtDict_photosynthesis"&gt;{{cite web |title=photosynthesis |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=photosynthesis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |access-date=2013-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307020959/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=photosynthesis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archive-date=2013-03-07 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ1&gt;{{LSJ|fw{{=}}s2|φῶς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ2&gt;{{LSJ|su/nqesis|σύνθεσις|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, [[oxygen]] is also released as a waste product. Most [[plant]]s, [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the [[atmospheric oxygen|oxygen content]] of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for [[life]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488–496 |date=Nov 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photosynthesis has four stages: [[Light absorption]], electron transport, ATP synthesis, and [[carbon fixation]].&lt;ref name = "lodish2008l"/&gt; Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by [[chlorophyll]] pigments attached to proteins in the [[Thylakoid#Membrane | thylakoid membrane]]s. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a [[quinone]] designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is [[Redox|reduced]] to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called [[photosystem I]] (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration.&lt;ref name = "lodish2008l"/&gt; 

During the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their [[concentration gradient]]s from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.&lt;ref name = "lodish2008l"/&gt; The NADPH and ATPs generated by the [[light-dependent reaction]]s in the second and third stages, respectively, provide the energy and electrons to drive the synthesis of glucose by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide into existing organic carbon compounds, such as [[ribulose bisphosphate]] (RuBP) in a sequence of light-independent (or dark) reactions called the [[Calvin cycle]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-321-73975-2"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Reece J, Urry L, Cain M, Wasserman S, Minorsky P, Jackson R |title=Biology |edition=International |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-321-73975-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781256158769/page/235 235, 244] |quote=This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. |year=2011 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781256158769/page/235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cell signaling====
Cell communication (or [[Cell signaling|signaling]]) is the ability of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself.&lt;ref name = "neitzelrasband2021"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Neitzel | first1 = James | last2 = Rasband | first2 = Matthew | title = Cell communication | journal = Nature Education | access-date = 29 May 2021 | url = https://www.nature.com/scitable/topic/cell-communication-14122659/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "cellsignalling"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cell signaling | journal = Nature Education | access-date = 29 May 2021 | url = https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-signaling-14047077/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signals can be non-chemical such as light, [[Action potential|electrical impulses]], and heat, or chemical signals (or [[ligand]]s) that interact with [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], which can be found [[Cell surface receptor|embedded]] in the [[cell membrane]] of another cell or [[Intracellular receptor|located deep inside]] a cell.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014e"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4 = Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Cell membranes and signaling | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 82–104 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "cellsignalling"/&gt; There are generally four types of chemical signals: [[Autocrine signaling|autocrine]], [[Paracrine signaling|paracrine]], [[Juxtacrine signalling|juxtacrine]], and [[hormone]]s.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014e"/&gt; In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it. [[Neoplasm|Tumor]] cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affect them. For example, brain cells called [[neuron]]s release ligands called [[neurotransmitter]]s that diffuse across a [[chemical synapse#Structure | synaptic cleft]] to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or [[muscle cell]]. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the [[circulatory system]]s of animals or [[vascular system]]s of plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an [[Ligand-gated ion channel | inotropic receptor]] can alter the [[Cell excitability|excitability]] of a target cell. Other types of receptors include [[protein kinase]] receptors (e.g., [[Insulin receptor|receptor]] for the hormone [[insulin]]) and [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate [[Second messenger system|second messenger]] cascades. The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a [[biochemical cascade|series of molecular events]] is called [[signal transduction]]

====Cell cycle====
[[File:Meiosis Overview new.svg|thumb|300x300px|In meiosis, the chromosomes duplicate and the [[homologous chromosome]]s exchange genetic information during meiosis I. The daughter cells divide again in meiosis II to form haploid [[gamete]]s.]]
The [[cell cycle]] is a series of events that take place in a [[cell (biology)|cell]] that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the [[DNA replication|duplication of its DNA]] and some of its [[Organelle|organelles]], and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called [[cell division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dictionary of biology|date=2020 | vauthors = Martin EA, Hine R | publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199204625|edition=6th|location=Oxford|oclc=176818780}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[eukaryote]]s (i.e., [[animal]], [[plant]], [[fungal]], and [[protist]] cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to genetic analysis|date=2012| publisher=W.H.

Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of [[interphase]] (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by [[telophase]] and [[cytokinesis]]; which divides the [[cytoplasm]], [[organelle]]s and [[cell membrane]] of one cell into two new [[Cell (biology)|cells]] containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two  genetically identical daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=10.2 The Cell Cycle - Biology 2e {{!}} OpenStax|url=https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/10-2-the-cell-cycle|access-date=2020-11-24|website=openstax.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled [[fertilized egg]] develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which [[hair]], [[skin]], [[blood cell]]s, and some [[viscus|internal organs]] are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the [[interphase]] of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions.&lt;ref name = "freeman2017m"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freeman| first1 = Scott | last2 = Quillin | first2 = Kim | last3 = Allison | first3 = Lizabeth | last4 = Black | first4 = Michael |  last5 = Podgorski | first5 = Greg | last6 = Taylor | first6 = Emily | last7 = Carmichael | first7 = Jeff | chapter = Meiosis | title = Biological Science | publisher = Pearson | edition = 6th | date = 2017 | location = Hoboken, N.J. | pages = 271–289 | isbn = 978-0321976499}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homologous chromosome]]s are separated in the first division ([[Meiosis#Meiosis I|meiosis I]]), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division ([[Meiosis#Meiosis II|meiosis II]]). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.

[[Prokaryote]]s (i.e., [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]) can also undergo cell division (or [[binary fission]]). Unlike the processes of [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] in eukaryotes, binary fission takes in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a [[spindle apparatus]] on the cell. Before binary fission, DNA in the bacterium is tightly coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. Growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by [[FtsZ]] polymerization and "Z-ring" formation)&lt;ref name=":32046082"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casiraghi A, Suigo L, Valoti E, Straniero V | title = Targeting Bacterial Cell Division: A Binding Site-Centered Approach to the Most Promising Inhibitors of the Essential Protein FtsZ | journal = Antibiotics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 69 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32046082 | doi = 10.3390/antibiotics9020069 | pmc = 7167804 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new cell wall ([[Septum (cell biology)|septum]]) fully develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, [[ribosome]]s, and [[plasmid]]s.

Mendel established several principles of inheritance. The first is that genetic characteristics, which are now called [[allele]]s, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on his [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of dominance and uniformity|law of dominance and uniformity]], which states that some alleles are [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] while others are [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the [[phenotype]] of that dominant allele.&lt;ref name="Mendelian Principles"&gt;Rutgers: [http://lifesci.dls.rutgers.edu/~mcguire/Toolbox-Demo/Basic%20Genetics/Mendelian%20Principles.htm Mendelian Principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions to this rule include [[penetrance]] and [[Expressivity (genetics)|expressivity]].&lt;ref name = "miko2008a"/&gt; Mendel noted that during gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene, which is stated by his [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of segregation|law of segregation]]. [[Heterozygous|Heterozygotic]] individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, Mendel formulated the [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment|law of independent assortment]], which states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are [[sex linkage | sex-linked]].

====DNA====
[[File:DNA animation.gif | thumb | Bases lie between two spiraling DNA strands.]]
Deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]) is a [[molecule]] composed of two [[polynucleotide]] chains that coil around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] carrying [[genetics|genetic]] hereditary information. The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s as they are composed of [[monomer]]s called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 978-0-8153-4432-2 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |name-list-style=vanc |title=DNA |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archive-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogenous [[nucleobase | base]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[Organophosphate|phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four bases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. Bases of the two polynucleotide strands are bound together by [[hydrogen bond]]s, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), to make double-stranded DNA. The bases are divided into two groups: [[pyrimidine]]s and [[purine]]s. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine whereas the purines are adenine and guanine. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. DNA is [[DNA replication|replicated]] once the two strands separate.

A [[gene]] is a unit of [[heredity]] that corresponds to a region of [[DNA]] that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. DNA is found as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of [[DNA]] and [[histone]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], or other locations is collectively known as a cell's [[genome]].

====Gene expression====
[[File:Extended Central Dogma with Enzymes.jpg|thumb| 250px | right | The extended [[central dogma of molecular biology]] includes all the processes involved in the flow of genetic information.]]
[[Gene expression]] is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional [[gene product]] that enables it to produce end products, protein or [[non-coding RNA]], and ultimately affect a [[phenotype]], as the final effect. The process is summarized in the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] first formulated by [[Francis Crick]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH | title = On protein synthesis | journal = Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology | volume = 12 | pages = 138–63 | date = 1958 | pmid = 13580867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick F | title = Central dogma of molecular biology | journal = Nature | volume = 227 | issue = 5258 | pages = 561–3 | date = August 1970 | pmid = 4913914 | doi = 10.1038/227561a0 | bibcode = 1970Natur.227..561C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Central dogma reversed | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1198–9 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 5422595 | doi = 10.1038/2261198a0 | bibcode = 1970Natur.226.1198. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene expression is the most fundamental level at which a [[genotype]] gives rise to a [[phenotype]], i.e., observable trait. The genetic information stored in [[DNA]] represents the genotype, whereas the phenotype results from the synthesis of proteins that control an organism's structure and development, or that act as [[enzyme]]s catalyzing specific metabolic pathways. A large part of DNA (e.g., &gt;98% in humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for [[Primary protein structure|protein sequences]]. [[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA) strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes [[uracil]] (U).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Uracil|title=Uracil|website=Genome.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[genetic code]], these mRNA strands specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]], which occurs in [[ribosome]]s. This process is used by all life—[[eukaryotes]] (including [[multicellular organisms]]), [[prokaryotes]] ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), and utilized by [[virus]]es—to generate the [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] machinery for life. Gene products are often [[protein]]s, but in non-protein-coding genes such as [[Transfer RNA|transfer RNA (tRNA)]] and [[Small nuclear RNA|small nuclear RNA (snRNA)]], the product is a functional [[List of RNAs|non-coding RNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Temin HM, Mizutani S | title = RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in virions of Rous sarcoma virus | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1211–3 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 4316301 | doi = 10.1038/2261211a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D | title = RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in virions of RNA tumour viruses | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1209–11 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 4316300 | doi = 10.1038/2261209a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All steps in the gene expression process can be regulated, including the [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]], [[RNA splicing]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], and [[post-translational modification]] of a protein.

Morphogenesis, or development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014n"/&gt; Specially, the organization of differentiated tissues into specific structures such as arms or wings, which is known as [[Pattern_formation#Biology | pattern formation]], is governed by [[morphogen]]s, signaling molecules that move from one group of cells to surrounding cells, creating a morphogen gradient as described by the [[French flag model]]. [[Apoptosis]], or programmed cell death, also occurs during morphogenesis, such as the death of cells between digits in human embryonic development, which frees up individual fingers and toes. Expression of [[transcription factor]] genes can determine organ placement in a plant and a cascade of transcription factors themselves can establish body segmentation in a fruit fly.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014n"/&gt;

A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the [[Evo-devo gene toolkit|developmental-genetic toolkit]] control the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among [[Phylum |phyla]], meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the [[Hox gene |''Hox'' genes]]. Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many [[vertebra]]e of [[snake]]s, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |author-link=Sean B.

===Evolution===

{{Further | Evolutionary biology}}
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|[[Natural selection]] for darker traits.]]
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through [[evolution]], which is the change in [[Heredity|heritable]] [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]] of [[population]]s over successive [[generation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hallgrímsson|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jrDD3cyA09kC&amp;pg=PA4 4–6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution Resources |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |year=2016 |url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603230514/http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |archive-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life on Earth. The term ''evolution'' was introduced into the scientific lexicon by [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]] in 1809,&lt;ref name="p15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Packard |first=Alpheus Spring |title= Lamarck, the founder of Evolution: his life and work with translations of his writings on organic evolution|url=https://archive.org/details/lamarckfoundere05packgoog |year= 1901 |publisher= Longmans, Green |location=New York | isbn=978-0-405-12562-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fifty years later [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html | title=The Complete Works of Darwin Online – Biography | publisher=darwin-online.org.uk | access-date=2006-12-15 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html | archive-date=2007-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=T. | year=1973 |title=Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution |journal=The American Biology Teacher |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=125–29 |doi= 10.2307/4444260|jstor=4444260 |citeseerx=10.1.1.525.3586|s2cid=207358177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection | editor-last=Carroll | editor-first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario | isbn=978-1-55111-337-1 | page=15 | quote=As Darwinian scholar Joseph Carroll of the University of Missouri–St. Louis puts it in his introduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: "''The Origin of Species'' has special claims on our attention.

It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, individuals differ from each other with respect to their heritable traits, resulting in different rates of survival and reproduction. As a results, traits that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to be passed on to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="lewontin70"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=Richard C. |author-link=Richard Lewontin |date=November 1970 |title=The Units of Selection |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.01.110170.000245 |jstor=2096764 |issn=1545-2069 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206172942/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859).

In the absence of any evolutionary process acting on a large random mating population, the allele frequencies will remain constant across generations as described by the [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]].&lt;ref name="futuyma2017d"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Futuyma | first1 = Douglas J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = Mark | date = 2017 | pages = 79–101 | chapter = Mutation and variation | title = Evolution | edition = 4th | location = Sunderland, Mass. | publisher = Sinauer Associates }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another process that drives evolution is [[genetic drift]], which is the random fluctuations of allele frequencies within a population from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name=GGS&gt;{{Cite book | last=Simpson | first=George Gaylord | author-link=George Gaylord Simpson | year=1967 | title=The Meaning of Evolution | publisher=Yale University Press | edition=Second | isbn=978-0-300-00952-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies are equally likely to ''drift'' upward or downward at each successive generation because the alleles are subject to [[sampling error]].&lt;ref name="Masel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masel |first=Joanna |s2cid=17619958 |date=October 25, 2011 |title=Genetic drift |journal=Current Biology |volume=21 |issue=20 |pages=R837–R838 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.007 |issn=0960-9822 |pmid=22032182|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed, either by disappearing from the population or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone.

====Speciation====
[[File:Speciation modes.svg|right|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]], [[peripatric speciation|peripatric]], [[parapatric speciation|parapatric]] and [[sympatric speciation]]]]
[[Speciation]] is the process of splitting one lineage into two lineages that evolve independently from each other.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014q"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Speciation | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 343–356 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; For speciation to occur, there has to be [[reproductive isolation]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014q"/&gt; Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by [[Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model]]. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with [[genetic divergence]]. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as [[allopatric speciation]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014q"/&gt; In contrast, [[sympatric speciation]] occurs in the absence of physical barriers. 

[[Reproductive isolation#Pre-zygotic isolation | Pre-zygotic isolation]] such as [[Reproductive isolation#Mechanical isolation|mechanical]], [[Reproductive isolation#Mechanical isolation|temporal]], [[Reproductive isolation#Behavioral isolation | behavioral]], habitat, and [[Reproductive isolation#Gametic isolation|gametic isolation]]s can prevent different species from [[Hybrid (biology) | hybridizing]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014q"/&gt; Similarly, [[Reproductive isolation#Post-zygotic isolation|post-zygotic isolation]]s can result in hybridization being selected against due to the lower viability of hybrids or hybrid infertility (e.g., [[mule]]). [[Hybrid zone]]s can emerge if there were to be incomplete reproductive isolation between two closely related species.

====Phylogenies====
{{Further|Phylogenetics|Biodiversity}}
{{PhylomapB|caption = Phylogenetic tree showing the domains of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s}}
A phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Reconstructing and using phylogenies | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 325–342 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phylogeny can be represented using a [[phylogenetic tree]], which is a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of descendents of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a node (or split) on the phylogenetic tree. The more splits there are over time, the more branches there will be on the tree, with the common ancestor of all the organisms in that tree being represented by the root of that tree. Phylogenetic trees may portray the evolutionary history of all life forms, a major evolutionary group (e.g., [[insect]]s), or an even smaller group of closely related [[species]]. Within a tree, any group of species designated by a name is a [[taxon]] (e.g., humans, primates, mammals, or vertebrates) and a taxon that consists of all its evolutionary descendants is a [[clade]], otherwise known as a [[monophyletic]] taxon.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt; Closely related species are referred to as [[Sister group|sister species]] and closely related clades are sister clades. In contrast to a monophyletic group, a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group does not include its common ancestor whereas a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group does not include all the descendants of a common ancestor.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt;

Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt; Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having [[Homology (biology) | homologous]] features. Homologous features may be any [[Heredity|heritable]] [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] such as [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]], protein structures, anatomical features, and behavior patterns. A [[vertebral column]] is an example of a homologous feature shared by all vertebrate animals. Traits that have a similar form or function but were not derived from a common ancestor are described as [[analogous structures | analogous feature]]s. Phylogenies can be reconstructed for a group of organisms of primary interests, which are called the ingroup. A species or group that is closely related to the ingroup but is phylogenetically outside of it is called the [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]], which serves a reference point in the tree. The root of the tree is located between the ingroup and the outgroup.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt; When phylogenetic trees are reconstructed, multiple trees with different evolutionary histories can be generated. Based on the principle of [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics) |Parsimony (or Occam's razor)]], the tree that is favored is the one with the fewest evolutionary changes needed to be assumed over all traits in all groups. [[Computational phylogenetics|Computational algorithms]] can be used to determine how a tree might have evolved given the evidence.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt;

Phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification, which is based on [[Linnaean taxonomy]] that was developed by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt; This classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the [[Domain (biology)|domain]] followed by [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[Class (biology)|class]], [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Family (biology) | family]], [[genus]], and [[species]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt; All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of [[three-domain system | three domain]]s: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[bacteria]] (originally eubacteria), or [[Eukaryote|eukarya]] (includes the [[protist]], [[fungi]], [[plant]], and [[animal]] kingdoms).&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Woese, CR |author2=Kandler, O |author3=Wheelis, ML | title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=87 | issue=12 | pages=4576–79 | date=June 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc=54159 | doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[binomial nomenclature]] is used to classify different species. Based on this system, each species is given two names, one for its genus and another for its species.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014p"/&gt; For example, humans are ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', with ''Homo'' being the genus and ''sapiens'' being the species.

The [[history of life]] on [[Earth]] traces the processes by which [[organism]]s have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on [[Earth]], both living and extinct, descended from a [[last universal common ancestor]] that lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Montévil, M |author2=Mossio, M |author3=Pocheville, A |author4=Longo, G | title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=122 | issue=1 | pages=36–50 | date=October 2016 | pmid=27530930 | doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005 | url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089 | series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150224/http://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation | archive-date=2018-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="deduve2002"&gt;{{cite book | title=Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning | url=https://archive.org/details/lifeevolvingmole00duve_331 | url-access=limited | last=De Duve | first=Christian | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002| page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeevolvingmole00duve_331/page/n60 44] | isbn=978-0-19-515605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities among all known present-day [[species]] indicate that they have diverged through the process of [[evolution]] from their common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists regard the ubiquity of the [[genetic code]] as evidence of universal [[common descent]] for all [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="Futuyma"&gt;{{cite book |author=Futuyma, DJ |title=Evolution |year=2005 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-187-3 |oclc=57311264 |url=https://archive.org/details/evolution0000futu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 343–364"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pearce |first1=Ben K.D. |last2=Tupper |first2=Andrew S. |last3=Pudritz |first3=Ralph E. |author3-link=Ralph Pudritz |last4=Higgs |first4=Paul G. |display-authors=3 |date=March 1, 2018 |title=Constraining the Time Interval for the Origin of Life on Earth |journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=343–364 |arxiv=1808.09460 |s2cid=4419671 |bibcode=2018AsBio..18..343P |doi=10.1089/ast.2017.1674 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=29570409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosing 674–676"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosing |first=Minik T. |date=January 29, 1999 |title=&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-Depleted Carbon Microparticles in &amp;gt;3700-Ma Sea-Floor Sedimentary Rocks from West Greenland |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=283 |issue=5402 |pages=674–676 |bibcode=1999Sci...283..674R |doi=10.1126/science.283.5402.674 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=9924024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohtomo 25–28"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ohtomo |first1=Yoko |last2=Kakegawa |first2=Takeshi |last3=Ishida |first3=Akizumi |last4=Nagase |first4=Toshiro |last5=Rosing |first5=Minik T. |display-authors=3 |date=January 2014 |title=Evidence for biogenic graphite in early Archaean Isua metasedimentary rocks |journal=[[Nature Geoscience]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=25–28 |bibcode=2014NatGe...7...25O |doi=10.1038/ngeo2025 |issn=1752-0894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacteria]] are a type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] that constitute a large [[domain (biology)|domain]] of [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s. Typically a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s in length, bacteria have a [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell morphology|number of shapes]], ranging from [[coccus|spheres]] to [[bacillus (shape)|rods]] and [[spiral bacteria|spirals]]. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on [[Earth]], and are present in most of its [[habitat]]s.

Bacteria also live in [[symbiotic]] and [[parasitic]] relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the [[bacterial phyla]] have species that can be [[microbiological culture|grown]] in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=Dudek&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dudek NK, Sun CL, Burstein D | title = Novel Microbial Diversity and Functional Potential in the Marine Mammal Oral Microbiome | journal = Current Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 24 | pages =  3752–3762 | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2017.10.040 | pmid = 29153320 | s2cid = 43864355 | url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt1w91s3vq/qt1w91s3vq.pdf?t=pghuwe | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Halobacteria.jpg|thumb| left | [[Archaea]] – [[Halobacteria]]]]
[[Archaea]] constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially [[Taxonomy (biology)|classified]] as [[bacteria]], receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]), a term that has fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pace NR | title = Time for a change | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7091 | pages = 289 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16710401 | doi = 10.1038/441289a | bibcode = 2006Natur.441..289P | s2cid = 4431143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other [[three-domain system|two domains]], [[Bacteria]] and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]]. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized [[phylum|phyla]]. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the flat and square cells of ''[[Haloquadratum walsbyi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoeckenius W | title = Walsby's square bacterium: fine structure of an orthogonal procaryote | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 352–60 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 7287626 | pmc = 216199 | doi = 10.1128/JB.148.1.352-360.1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarity to bacteria, archaea possess [[gene]]s and several [[metabolic pathway]]s that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the [[enzyme]]s involved in [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]]. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on [[ether lipid]]s in their [[cell membrane]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Archaea Basic Biology | date = March 2018 | url =https://basicbiology.net/micro/microorganisms/archaea }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[archaeol]]s. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from [[organic compounds]], such as sugars, to [[ammonia]], [[ion|metal ions]] or even [[hydrogen|hydrogen gas]]. [[Halophile|Salt-tolerant]] archaea (the [[Haloarchaea]]) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]], but unlike plants and [[cyanobacteria]], no known species of archaea does both. Archaea [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] by [[binary fission]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], or [[budding]]; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form [[endospore]]s.

The first observed archaea were [[extremophile]]s, living in extreme environments, such as [[hot spring]]s and [[salt lake]]s with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every [[habitat]], including soil, oceans, and [[marshland]]s. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in [[plankton]] may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.

Archaea are a major part of [[Life|Earth's life]]. They are part of the [[microbiota]] of all organisms. In the [[human microbiome]], they are important in the [[Colon (anatomy)|gut]], mouth, and on the skin.&lt;ref name=Bang2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bang C, Schmitz RA | title = Archaea associated with human surfaces: not to be underestimated | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 631–48 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25907112 | doi = 10.1093/femsre/fuv010 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and [[Syntrophy|syntrophic]] communities, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moissl-Eichinger C, Pausan M, Taffner J, Berg G, Bang C, Schmitz RA | title = Archaea Are Interactive Components of Complex Microbiomes | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–85 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28826642 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2017.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|right|Diversity of plants]]
Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly [[photosynthetic]] [[eukaryote]]s of the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] Plantae, which would exclude [[fungi]] and some [[algae]]. Approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] have been studied, of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including approximately 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),&lt;ref&gt;RBG Kew (2016). The State of the World's Plants Report – 2016. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. https://stateoftheworldsplants.com/report/sotwp_2016.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928190506/https://stateoftheworldsplants.com/report/sotwp_2016.pdf |date=2016-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 20,000 are [[bryophyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/B/|title=The Plant List – Bryophytes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae is a large and diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[eukaryotic]] [[organism]]s. Included organisms range from [[unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[microalgae]], such as ''[[Chlorella]],'' [[Prototheca]] and the [[diatom]]s, to [[multicellular]] forms, such as the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]], a large [[brown algae|brown alga]]. Most are aquatic and [[autotrophic]] and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as [[stoma]]ta, [[xylem]] and [[phloem]], which are found in [[embryophyte|land plants]]. The largest and most complex marine algae are called [[seaweed]]s, while the most complex freshwater forms are the [[Charophyta]].

[[Non-vascular plant|Nonvascular plant]]s are [[plant]]s without a [[vascular tissue|vascular system]] consisting of [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. Instead, they may possess simpler tissues that have specialized functions for the internal transport of water. [[Vascular plant]]s, on the other hand, are a large group of plants ({{circa}} 300,000 accepted known species)&lt;ref name="Christenhusz-Byng2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Christenhusz, M. J.

Vascular plants include the [[clubmoss]]es, [[Equisetum|horsetails]], [[fern]]s, [[gymnosperm]]s (including [[conifer]]s) and [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants). 

Seed plants (or [[spermatophyte]]) comprise five divisions, four of which are grouped as [[gymnosperms]] and one is angiosperms. Gymnosperms includes [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[cycad]]s, ''[[Ginkgo]]'', and [[gnetophyta|gnetophyte]]s. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form [[Conifer cone|cones]], or solitary as in [[Taxus|yew]], ''[[Torreya]]'', ''Ginkgo''.&lt;ref name="TPL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/browse/G/|title=Gymnosperms on The Plant List|publisher=Theplantlist.org|access-date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angiosperms are the most diverse group of [[Embryophyte|land plants]], with 64 [[Order(biology)|orders]], 416 [[Family (biology)|families]], approximately 13,000 known [[Genus|genera]] and 300,000 known [[species]].&lt;ref name="Christenhusz-Byng2016"/&gt; Like [[gymnosperm]]s, angiosperms are [[Spermatophyte|seed-producing plants]]. They are distinguished from gymnosperms by having characteristics such as [[flower]]s, [[endosperm]] within their [[seed]]s, and production of [[fruit]]s that contain the seeds.

====Fungi====
{{Further | Mycology}}
[[File:Fungi_collage.jpg | thumb | Diversity of fungi. Clockwise from top left: [[Amanita muscaria]], a basidiomycete; [[Sarcoscypha coccinea]], an ascomycete; bread covered in [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]; [[Chytridiomycota|chytrid]]; [[Aspergillus]] [[conidiophore]].]]
[[Fungus|Fungi]] are [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms that include microorganisms such as [[yeast]]s and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, as well as the more familiar [[mushroom]]s. A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is [[chitin]] in their [[cell wall]]s. Fungi, like animals, are [[heterotroph]]s; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting [[digestive enzyme]]s into their environment. Fungi do not [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Growth is their means of [[motility|mobility]], except for [[spore]]s (a few of which are [[Flagellated cell|flagellated]]), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal [[decomposer]]s in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the ''Eumycota'' (''true fungi'' or ''Eumycetes''), which share a [[common ancestor]] (from a ''[[monophyletic]] group''). This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar [[Mycetozoa|myxomycetes]] (slime molds) and [[oomycete]]s (water molds). 

Most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their [[Crypsis|cryptic]] lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] of plants, animals, or other fungi and also [[parasites]]. They may become noticeable when [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting]], either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycling]] and exchange in the environment. 

The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of [[taxon|taxa]] with varied ecologies, [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] strategies, and [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] ranging from unicellular aquatic [[chytrid]]s to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true [[biodiversity]] of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2&amp;nbsp;million to 3.8&amp;nbsp;million species.&lt;ref name=Lucking2017&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors=Hawksworth DL, Lücking R | title=The Fungal Kingdom | chapter=Fungal Diversity Revisited: 2.2 to 3.8 Million Species | journal=Microbiology Spectrum | volume=5 | issue=4 | pages=79–95 | date=July 2017 | pmid=28752818 | doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.FUNK-0052-2016 | isbn=978-1-55581-957-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only about 148,000 have been described,&lt;ref name="Cheek et al. 2020"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |last1=Cheek |first1=Martin |last2=Nic Lughadha |first2=Eimear |last3=Kirk |first3=Paul |last4=Lindon |first4=Heather |last5=Carretero |first5=Julia |last6=Looney |first6=Brian |last7=Douglas |first7=Brian |last8=Haelewaters |first8=Danny |last9=Gaya |first9=Ester |last10=Llewellyn |first10=Theo |last11=Ainsworth |first11=A.

[[Animals]] are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals [[Heterotroph|consume organic material]], [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|breathe oxygen]], are [[Motility|able to move]], can [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], and grow from a hollow sphere of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], the [[blastula]], during [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Over 1.5 million [[Extant taxon|living]] animal [[species]] have been [[Species description|described]]—of which around 1 million are [[Insecta|insects]]—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. They have [[Ecology|complex interactions]] with each other and their environments, forming intricate [[food web]]s.

When infected, a host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of the [[genetic material]] ([[DNA]] or [[RNA]]), a [[protein]] coat called ''[[capsid]]'', and in some cases an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]], as they are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria.

The origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Canchaya"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Canchaya C, Fournous G, Chibani-Chennoufi S, Dillmann ML, Brüssow H | title = Phage as agents of lateral gene transfer | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–24 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12941415 | doi = 10.1016/S1369-5274(03)00086-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because viruses possess some but not all characteristics of life, they have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Self-replication|self-replicators]].&lt;ref name="kooninstarokadomskyy2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Starokadomskyy P | title = Are viruses alive?

Viruses can spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal–oral route|faecal–oral route]], passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. Viral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection.

[[File:Plant.svg|thumb|right| Root and shoot systems in a [[eudicot]].]]
The plant body is made up of [[Organ (biology) | organ]]s that can be organized into two major [[organ system]]s: a [[root | root system]] and a [[shoot | shoot system]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014x"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4 = Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = The plant body | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 521–536 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root system anchors the plants into place. The roots themselves absorb water and minerals and store photosynthetic products. The shoot system is composed of [[Plant stem|stem]], [[Leaf|leaves]], and [[flower]]s. The stems hold and orient the leaves to the sun, which allow the leaves to conduct photosynthesis. The flowers are [[shoot]]s that have been modified for [[reproduction]]. Shoots are composed of [[phytomer]]s, which are [[functional unit]]s that consist of a node carrying one or more leaves, internode, and one or more [[bud]]s. 

A plant body has two basic patterns (apical–basal and radial axes) that been established during [[Plant embryogenesis | embryogenesis]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014x"/&gt; Cells and tissues are arranged along the apical-basal axis from root to shoot whereas the three tissue systems ([[Dermal tissue system|dermal]], [[Ground tissue|ground]], and [[Vascular tissue|vascular]]) that make up a plant's body are arranged concentrically around its radial axis.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014x"/&gt; The dermal tissue system forms the [[epidermis]] (or outer covering) of a plant, which is usually a single cell layer that consists of cells that have differentiated into three specialized structures: [[stomata]] for gas exchange in leaves, [[trichome]]s (or leaf hair) for protection against [[insect]]s and [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]], and [[root hair]]s for increased surface areas and absorption of water and nutrients. The ground tissue makes up virtually all the tissue that lies between the dermal and vascular tissues in the shoots and roots. It consists of three cell types: [[Parenchyma]], [[collenchyma]], and [[sclerenchyma]] cells. Finally, the vascular tissues are made up of two constituent tissues: [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. The xylem is made up two of conducting cells called [[tracheid]]s and [[vessel element]]s whereas the phloem is characterized by the presence of [[sieve tube element]]s and [[companion cell]]s.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014x"/&gt;

====Plant nutrition and transport====
{{Further | Vascular plant#Nutrient distribution}}
[[File:Xylem and phloem diagram.svg|thumb| The xylem (blue) transports water and minerals from the roots upwards whereas the phloem (orange) transports carbohydrates between organs.]]
Like all other organisms, plants are primarily made up of water and other molecules containing [[chemical element | element]]s that are essential to life.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014y"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Plant nutrition and transport | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 537–554 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of specific nutrients (or [[Mineral_(nutrient)|essential element]]s), many of which have been identified in [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] experiments, can disrupt [[plant development | plant growth]] and [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]]. The majority of plants are able to obtain these nutrients from [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]]s that surrounds their [[root]]s in the [[soil]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014y"/&gt; Continuous [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] and [[harvest | harvesting]] of [[crop]]s can deplete the soil of its nutrients, which can be restored with the use of [[fertilizer]]s. [[Carnivorous plant]]s such as [[Venus flytrap]]s are able to obtain nutrients by digesting other [[arthropod]]s whereas [[parasitic plant]]s such as [[mistletoe]]s can parasitize other plants for water and nutrients. 

Plants need water to conduct [[photosynthesis]], transport [[solute]]s between organs, cool their leaves by [[evaporation]], and maintain internal pressures that support their bodies.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014y"/&gt; Water is able to [[diffusion | diffuse]] in and out of [[plant cell]]s by [[osmosis]]. The direction of water movement across a [[semipermeable membrane]] is determined by the [[water potential]] across that membrane.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014y"/&gt; Water is able to diffuse across a root cell's membrane through [[aquaporin]]s whereas solutes are transported across by the membrane by [[ion channel]]s and [[Ion transporter|pump]]s. In [[vascular plant]]s, water and solutes are able to enter the [[xylem]], a [[vascular tissue]], by way of an [[apoplast]] and [[symplast]]. Once in the xylem, the water and minerals are distributed upward by [[transpiration]] from the soil to the aerial parts of the plant.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014u"/&gt;&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014y"/&gt; In contrast, the [[phloem]], another vascular tissue, distributes [[carbohydrate]]s (e.g., [[sucrose]]) and other solutes such as hormones by [[Phloem#Function | translocation]] from a [[Pressure flow hypothesis#Sources and sinks|source]] (e.g., mature [[leaf]] or root) in which they were produced to a [[Pressure flow hypothesis#Sources and sinks|sink]] (e.g., root, [[flower]], or developing [[fruit]]) in which they will be used and stored.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014y"/&gt; Sources and sinks can switch roles, depending on the amount of carbohydrates accumulated or mobilized for the nourishment of other organs.

====Plant development====
[[Plant development]] is regulated by environmental cues and the plant's own [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, [[hormone]]s, and [[genome]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014aa"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Plant growth and development | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 555–572 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morever, they have several characteristics that allow them to obtain resources for growth and reproduction such as [[meristem]]s, post-embryonic organ formation, and differential growth.

Development begins with a [[seed]], which is an [[Plant embryogenesis|embryonic]] [[plant]] enclosed in a [[testa (botany)|protective outer covering]]. Most plant seeds are usually [[Seed dormancy|dormant]], a condition in which the seed's normal activity is suspended.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014aa"/&gt; Seed dormancy may last may last weeks, months, years, and even centuries. Dormancy is broken once conditions are favorable for growth, and the seed will begin to sprout, a process called [[germination]]. [[Imbibition]] is the first step in germination, whereby water is absorbed by the seed. Once water is absorbed, the seed undergoes metabolic changes whereby [[enzyme]]s are activated and [[RNA]] and [[protein]]s are synthesized. Once the seed germinates, it obtains [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and small [[lipid]]s that serve as building blocks for its development. These [[monomer]]s are obtained from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], [[protein]]s, and lipids that are stored in either the [[cotyledon]]s or [[endosperm]]. Germination is completed once embryonic roots called [[radicle]] have emerged from the [[Seed#Seed coat|seed coat]]. At this point, the developing plant is called a [[seedling]] and its growth is regulated by its own [[photoreceptor protein#Photoreceptors in plants|photoreceptor protein]]s and hormones.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014aa"/&gt;

Unlike [[animal]]s in which growth is determinate, i.e., ceases when the adult state is reached, plant growth is indeterminate as it is an open-ended process that could potentially be lifelong.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014x"/&gt; Plants grow in two ways: [[secondary growth | primary]] and [[secondary growth | secondary]]. In primary growth, the shoots and roots are formed and lengthened. The [[Meristem#Apical meristems|apical meristem]] produces the primary plant body, which can be found in all [[Spermatophyte | seed plant]]s. During secondary growth, the thickness of the plant increases as the [[Meristem#Secondary meristems | lateral meristem]] produces the secondary plant body, which can be found in woody [[eudicots]] such as trees and shrubs. [[Monocotyledon | Monocots]] do not go through secondary growth.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014x"/&gt; The plant body is generated by a hierarchy of [[meristem]]s. The apical meristems in the root and shoot systems give rise to primary meristems (protoderm, ground meristem, and [[Meristem#Primary meristems|procambium]]), which in turn, give rise to the three tissue systems ([[Dermal tissue system|dermal]], [[Ground tissue|ground]], and [[Vascular tissue|vascular]]).

====Plant reproduction====
{{Further | Plant reproduction}}
[[File: Figure 11 02 03.jpg |thumb |right |Reproduction and development in [[sporophyte]]s]]
Most [[angiosperms]] (or flowering plants) engage in [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ab"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Reproduction of flowering plants | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 573–588 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[flower]]s are organs that facilitate [[reproduction]], usually by providing a mechanism for the union of [[sperm]] with eggs. Flowers may facilitate two types of [[pollination]]: self-pollination and cross-pollination. [[Self-pollination]] occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. [[Cross-pollination]] is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happened in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower’s stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/self-pollination-and-cross-pollination/|title=Self-Pollination and Cross-Pollination &amp;#124; Biology for Majors II|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant responses====
{{Further|Plant perception (physiology)|Plant defense against herbivory#Chemical defenses}}
Like animals, plants produce [[plant hormone|hormones]] in one part of its body to signal cells in another part to respond. The [[ripening]] of [[fruit]] and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas [[Ethylene as a plant hormone|ethylene]] by the plant. Stress from water loss, changes in air chemistry, or crowding by other plants can lead to changes in the way a plant functions. These changes may be affected by genetic, chemical, and physical factors.

To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms. Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from [[herbivore]]s, [[pathogen]]s and competition from other plants. They do this by producing [[toxin]]s and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals. Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy, while other compounds are used to attract [[pollinator]]s or herbivores to spread ripe seeds.

Many plant organs contain different types of [[photoreceptor protein#Photoreceptors in plants | photoreceptor protein]]s, each of which reacts very specifically to certain wavelengths of light.&lt;ref name="pmid11687489"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photoreceptor proteins relay information such as whether it is day or night, duration of the day, intensity of light available, and the source of light. Shoots generally grow towards light, while roots grow away from it, responses known as [[phototropism]] and skototropism, respectively. They are brought about by light-sensitive pigments like [[phototropin]]s and [[phytochrome]]s and the plant hormone [[auxin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strong|first1=Donald R.|last2=Ray|first2=Thomas S.|author-link2=Thomas S. Ray|title=Host Tree Location Behavior of a Tropical Vine (''Monstera gigantea'') by Skototropism|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=1 January 1975|volume=190|issue=4216|pages=804–806|doi=10.1126/science.190.4216.804 |jstor=1741614|bibcode=1975Sci...190..804S|s2cid=84386403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[flowering plant]]s bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as [[photoperiodism]].

In addition to light, plants can respond to other types of stimuli. For instance, plants can sense the direction of [[gravity]] to orient themselves correctly. They can respond to mechanical stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaffe MJ, Forbes S | title = Thigmomorphogenesis: the effect of mechanical perturbation on plants | journal = Plant Growth Regulation | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–24 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 11541741 | doi = 10.1007/BF00027213 | s2cid = 29466083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal form and function===
====General features====
{{Further|Anatomy|Physiology}}
[[File:105 Negative Feedback Loops.jpg |right|thumb| [[Negative_feedback#Biology | Negative feedback]] is necessary for maintaining [[homeostasis]] such as keeping [[Thermoregulation | body temperature]] constant.]]
The cells in each animal body are bathed in [[interstitial fluid]], which make up the cell's environment. This fluid and all its characteristics (e.g., temperature, ionic composition) can be described as the animal's [[internal environment]], which is in contrast to the external environment that encompasses the animal's outside world.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Fundamentals of animal function | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 605–623 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals can be classified as either regulators or conformers. Animals such as [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s are regulators as they are able to maintain a constant internal environment such as body temperature despite their environments changing. These animals are also described as [[homeotherm]]s as they exhibit [[thermoregulation]] by keeping their internal body temperature constant. In contrast, animals such as [[fish]]es and [[frog]]s are conformers as they adapt their internal environment (e.g., body temperature) to match their external environments. These animals are also described as [[poikilotherm]]s or [[ectotherm]]s as they allow their body temperatures to match their external environments. In terms of energy, regulation is more costly than conformity as an animal expands more energy to maintain a constant internal environment such as increasing its [[basal metabolic rate]], which is the rate of energy consumption.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt; Similarly, homeothermy is more costly than poikilothermy. [[Homeostasis]] is the stability of an animal's internal environment, which is maintained by [[Negative feedback#Biology | negative feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rodolfo | first=Kelvin | date=January 2000 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-homeostasis/ | title=What is homeostasis? | journal=Scientific American | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020456/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-homeostasis | archive-date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body size of [[terrestrial animal]]s vary across different species but their use of energy does not [[Allometry#Physiological scaling|scale]] linearly according to their size.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt; Mice, for example, are able to consume three times more food than rabbits in proportion to their weights as the basal metabolic rate per unit weight in mice is greater than in rabbits.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt; [[Physical activity]] can also increase an animal's metabolic rate. When an animal runs, its metabolic rate increases linearly with speed.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt; However, the relationship is non-linear in animals that [[Aquatic locomotion|swim]] or [[Flight|fly]]. When a fish swims faster, it encounters greater water resistance and so its metabolic rates increases exponential.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt; Alternatively, the relationship of flight speeds and metabolic rates is U-shaped in birds.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ac"/&gt; At low flight speeds, a bird must maintain a high metabolic rates to remain airborne. As it speeds up its flight, its metabolic rate decreases with the aid of air rapidly flows over its wings. However, as it increases in its speed even further, its high metabolic rates rises again due to the increased effort associated with rapid flight speeds. Basal metabolic rates can be measured based on an animal's rate of [[heat]] production.

====Water and salt balance====
{{Further | Osmoregulation | Urinary system}}
An animal's [[body fluid]]s have three properties: [[osmotic pressure]], [[ion | ionic]] composition, and [[volume]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014aj"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Water and salt balance | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 751–767| isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osmotic pressures determine the direction of the [[diffusion]] of water (or [[osmosis]]), which moves from a region where osmotic pressure (total solute concentration) is low to a region where osmotic pressure (total solute concentration) is high. Aquatic animals are diverse with respect to their body fluid compositions and their environments. For example, most invertebrate animals in the ocean have body fluids that are [[Tonicity#Isotonicity | isosmotic]] with seawater. In contrast, ocean [[Osteichthyes | bony fish]]es have body fluids that are [[Tonicity#Hypotonic solution | hyposmotic]] to seawater. Finally, freshwater animals have body fluids that are [[Tonicity#Hypertonic solution|hyperosmotic]] to fresh water. Typical ions that can be found in an animal's body fluids are [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], and [[chloride]]. The volume of body fluids can be regulated by [[excretion]]. [[Vertebrate]] animals have [[kidney]]s, which are excretory organs made up of tiny tubular structures called [[nephron]]s, which make [[urine]] from blood plasma. The kidneys' primary function is to regulate the composition and volume of blood plasma by selectively removing material from the blood plasma itself. The ability of [[Deserts and xeric shrublands | xeric]] animals such as [[kangaroo rat]]s to minimize water loss by producing urine that is 10-20 times concentrated than their blood plasma allows them to adapt in [[desert]] environments that receive very little [[precipitation]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014aj"/&gt;

====Nutrition and digestion====
{{Further | Nutrition}}
[[File:Types of digestive systems in marine fish.jpg|thumb|right|Different digestive systems in marine fishes]]
Animals are [[heterotroph]]s as they feed on other organisms to obtain energy and [[organic compound]]s.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ad"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Nutrition, feeding, and digestion | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 624–642 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to obtain food in three major ways such as targeting visible food objects, collecting tiny food particles, or depending on microbes for critical food needs. The amount of [[Food energy|energy stored in food]] can be quantified based on the amount of heat (measured in [[calorie]]s or [[joule | kilojoules]]) emitted when the food is burnt in the presence of oxygen. If an animal were to consume food that contains an excess amount of chemical energy, it will store most of that energy in the form of [[lipid]]s for future use and some of that energy as [[glycogen]] for more immediate use (e.g., meeting the brain's energy needs).&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ad"/&gt; The molecules in food are chemical building blocks that are needed for growth and development. These molecules include nutrients such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[protein]]s. [[Vitamin]]s and [[Mineral (nutrient) | mineral]]s (e.g., calcium, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus) are also essential. The [[digestive system]], which typically consist of a tubular tract that extends from the mouth to the anus, is involved in the breakdown (or [[digestion]]) of food into small molecules as it travels down [[peristalsis | peristaltically]] through the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut lumen]] shortly after it has been [[ingestion | ingested]]. These small food molecules are then [[Absorption (biology) | absorbed]] into the blood from the lumen, where they are then distributed to the rest of the body as building blocks (e.g., amino acids) or sources of energy (e.g., glucose).&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ad"/&gt; 

In addition to their digestive tracts, vertebrate animals have accessory glands such as a liver and pancreas as part of their digestive systems.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ad"/&gt; The processing of food in these animals begins in the [[foregut]], which includes the mouth, [[esophagus]], and [[stomach]]. Mechanical digestion of food starts in the mouth with the esophagus serving as a passageway for food to reach the stomach, where it is stored and disintegrated (by the stomach's acid) for further processing. Upon leaving the stomach, food enters into the [[midgut]], which is the first part of the [[intestine]] (or [[small intestine]] in [[mammal]]s) and is the principal site of digestion and absorption. Food that does not get absorbed are stored as indigestible waste (or [[feces]]) in the [[hindgut]], which is the second part of the intestine (or [[large intestine]] in mammals). The hindgut then completes the reabsorption of needed water and salt prior to eliminating the feces from the [[rectum]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ad"/&gt;

====Breathing====
[[File: Cranial sinus and postcranial air sac systems in birds.svg | thumb | right | Respiratory system in a [[bird]].]]
The [[respiratory system]] consists of specific [[organs]] and structures used for [[gas exchange]] in [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In [[terrestrial animal|land animals]] the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the [[lung]]s.&lt;ref name="Biology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Neil A. |title=Biology |date=1990 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co. |location=Redwood City, Calif. |isbn=0-8053-1800-3 |pages=834–835 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gas exchange]] in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs; in mammals and reptiles these are called [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], and in birds they are known as [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|atria]]. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood.&lt;ref name="Hsia"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hsia |first1=CC |last2=Hyde |first2=DM |last3=Weibel |first3=ER |author3-link=ER Weibel |title=Lung Structure and the Intrinsic Challenges of Gas Exchange. |journal=Comprehensive Physiology |date=15 March 2016 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=827–95 |doi=10.1002/cphy.c150028 |pmid=27065169|pmc=5026132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the [[trachea]], which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main [[bronchus|bronchi]]. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the [[bronchiole]]s. In [[bird]]s the bronchioles are termed [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|parabronchi]]. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in mammals and [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|atria]] in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of [[breathing]], which involves the [[muscles of respiration]].

====Circulation====
[[File: Circulatory systems in the animal kingdom.svg | thumb | right | Circulatory systems in arthropods, fish, reptiles, and birds/mammals.]]
A [[circulatory system]] usually consists of a muscular pump such as a [[heart]], a fluid ([[blood]]), and system of [[blood vessel]]s that deliver it.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014af"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Circulation | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 661–680 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000105264|cardiovascular system}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal function is to transport [[blood]] and other substances to and from [[cell (biology)]]s and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s. There are two types of circulatory systems: [[Open circulatory system|open]] and [[Closed circulatory system|closed]]. In open circulatory systems, blood exits blood vessels as it circulates throughout the body whereas in closed circulatory system, blood is contained within the blood vessels as it circulates. Open circulatory systems can be observed in [[invertebrate]] animals such as [[arthropod]]s (e.g., [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[lobster]]s) whereas closed circulatory systems can be found in [[vertebrate]] animals such as [[fish]]es, [[amphibian]]s, and [[mammal]]s. Circulation in animals occur between two types of tissues: [[Circulatory system#Systemic circulation|systemic tissue]]s and [[Respiratory system|breathing (or pulmonary) organ]]s.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014af"/&gt; Systemic tissues are all the tissues and organs that make up an animal's body other than its breathing organs. Systemic tissues take up oxygen but adds carbon dioxide to the blood whereas a breathing organs takes up carbon dioxide but add oxygen to the blood.&lt;ref name="PubMed"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How does the blood circulatory system work?|journal=PubMed Health|date=1 August 2016|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072434/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In birds and mammals, the systemic and pulmonary systems are connected in series. 

In the circulatory system, blood is important because it is the means by which [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nutrient]]s, [[hormone]]s, agents of immune system, heat, wastes, and other commodities are transported.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014af"/&gt; In [[annelid]]s such as [[earthworm]]s and [[leech]]es, blood is propelled by [[Peristalsis|peristaltic wave]]s of [[Muscle contraction|contraction]]s of the heart muscles that make up the blood vessels. Other animals such as crustaceans (e.g., [[crayfish]] and [[lobster]]s), have more than one heart to propel blood throughout their bodies. Vertebrate hearts are [[Heart#Chambers|multichambered]] and are able to pump blood when their [[ventricle (heart) | ventricle]]s contract at each [[cardiac cycle]], which propels blood through the blood vessels.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014af"/&gt; Although vertebrate hearts are [[Myogenic mechanism|myogenic]], their rate of contraction (or [[heart rate]]) can be modulated by neural input from the body's [[autonomic nervous system]].

====Muscle and movement====
{{Further | Muscle contraction}}
[[File:Motion_of_Insectwing.gif|right|thumb|Asynchronous muscles power flight in most insects. a: Wings b: Wing joint c: Dorsoventral muscles power upstrokes d: Dorsolongitudinal muscles power downstrokes.]]
In [[vertebrate]]s, the [[muscular system]] consists of [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]], [[smooth muscle|smooth]] and [[cardiac muscle|cardiac]] [[muscle]]s. It permits movement of the body, maintains posture and circulates blood throughout the body.&lt;ref name="ross2011"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Pawlina |first1=Wojciech |last2=Ross | first2=Michael H. |title=Histology : a text and atlas : with correlated cell and molecular biology |date=2011 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Health |isbn=9780781772006 |edition=  6th |location=Philadelphia |oclc=548651322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[skeletal system]], it forms the [[musculoskeletal system]], which is responsible for the movement of vertebrate animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Standring |first=Susan |title=Gray's anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice |isbn=9780702052309 |edition=Forty-first |location=Philadelphia |oclc=920806541 |year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeletal muscle contractions are [[neurogenic]] as they require [[Synapse|synaptic input]] from [[motor neurons]]. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, which is explained by the [[sliding filament theory]]. The contraction produced can be described as a twitch, summation, or tetanus, depending on the frequency of [[action potentials]].

Most multicellular animals have [[nervous system]]s&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Nervous System| encyclopedia = Columbia Encyclopedia| publisher = Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow them to sense from and respond to their environments. A nervous system is a network of cells that processes [[Sense|sensory]] information and generates [[behavior]]s. At the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of [[neuron]]s, which are cells specialized to handle information.&lt;ref name = "aidley1998a"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Aidley | first1 = David J. | chapter = Introduction | title = The Physiology of Excitable Cells | publisher = Cambridge University Press | edition = 4th | date = 1998 | location = New York | pages = 1–7 | isbn = 978-0521574211}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can transmit or receive information at sites of contacts called [[synapse]]s.&lt;ref name = "aidley1998a"/&gt; More specifically, neurons can conduct nerve impulses (or [[action potential]]s) that travel along their thin fibers called [[axon]]s, which can then be transmitted directly to a neighboring cell through [[electrical synapse]]s or cause chemicals called [[neurotransmitter]]s to be released at [[chemical synapse]]s. According to the sodium theory, these action potentials can be generated by the increased permeability of the neuron's [[cell membrane]] to sodium ions.&lt;ref name = "aidley1998e"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Aidley | first1 = David J. | chapter = The ionic basis of nervous conduction | title = The Physiology of Excitable Cells | publisher = Cambridge University Press | edition = 4th | date = 1998 | location = New York | pages = 54–75 | isbn = 978-0521574211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells such as neurons or muscle cells may be excited or inhibited upon receiving a signal from another neuron. The connections between neurons can form [[neural pathway]]s, [[neural circuit]]s, and [[large scale brain networks|larger networks]] that generate an organism's perception of the world and determine its behavior. Along with neurons, the nervous system contains other specialized cells called [[glia]] or glial cells, which provide structural and metabolic support.

In vertebrates, the nervous system consists of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which includes the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]], and the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS), which consists of [[nerve]]s that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals from the CNS are called [[motor nerve]]s or [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent nerves]], while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called [[sensory nerve]]s or [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent nerves]]. [[Spinal nerve]]s are [[mixed nerve]]s that serve both functions. The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the [[somatic nervous system|somatic]], [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], and [[enteric nervous system|enteric]] nervous systems. Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state. The enteric nervous system functions to control the [[gastrointestinal]] system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily. Nerves that exit directly from the brain are called [[cranial nerves]] while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves.

Many animals have [[Sensory nervous system|sense organ]]s that can detect their environment. These sense organs contain [[sensory receptor]]s, which are sensory neurons that convert stimuli into electrical signals.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ah"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = Neurons, sense organs, and nervous systems | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 699–732 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mechanoreceptor]]s, for example, which can be found in skin, muscle, and hearing organs, generate action potentials in response to changes in pressures.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ah"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "freeman2017ar"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freeman| first1 = Scott | last2 = Quillin | first2 = Kim | last3 = Allison | first3 = Lizabeth | last4 = Black | first4 = Michael |  last5 = Podgorski | first5 = Greg | last6 = Taylor | first6 = Emily | last7 = Carmichael | first7 = Jeff | chapter = Animal sensory systems | title = Biological Science | publisher = Pearson | edition = 6th | date = 2017 | location = Hoboken, N.J. | pages = 922–941 | isbn = 978-0321976499}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photoreceptor cell]]s such as [[Rod cell|rod]]s and [[Cone cell|cone]]s, which are part of the vertebrate [[retina]], can respond to specific [[Electromagnetic spectrum | wavelengths of light]].&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ah"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "freeman2017ar"/&gt; [[Chemoreceptor]]s detect chemicals in the mouth ([[taste]]) or in the air ([[sense of smell|smell]]).&lt;ref name = "freeman2017ar"/&gt;

In [[vertebrate]]s, the [[hypothalamus]] is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. In [[humans]] specifically, the major [[endocrine gland]]s are the [[thyroid gland]] and the [[adrenal gland]]s. Many other organs that are part of other body systems have secondary endocrine functions, including [[bone]], [[kidney]]s, [[liver]], [[heart]] and [[gonad]]s. For example, kidneys secrete the endocrine hormone [[erythropoietin]]. Hormones can be amino acid complexes, [[steroid]]s, [[eicosanoid]]s, [[leukotriene]]s, or [[prostaglandin]]s.&lt;ref name="Marieb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marieb |first=Elaine |name-list-style=vanc |title=Anatomy &amp; physiology |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc |location=Glenview, IL |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-321-86158-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endocrine system can be contrasted to both [[exocrine glands]], which secrete hormones to the outside of the body, and [[paracrine signaling]] between cells over a relatively short distance. Endocrine glands have no [[Duct (anatomy)|ducts]], are vascular, and commonly have intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as [[salivary gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, and glands within the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].

[[Gastrulation]] occurs, whereby morphogenetic movements convert the cell mass into a three [[germ layers]] that comprise the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

====Immune system====
{{Further | Immunology}}
[[File:Primary immune response 1.png|thumb|right|Processes in the primary immune response]]
The [[immune system]] is a network of [[biological process]]es that detects and responds to a wide variety of [[pathogen]]s. Many species have two major subsystems of the immune system. The [[innate immune system]] provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The [[adaptive immune system]] provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered. Both use [[humoral immunity|molecules]] and [[cell-mediated immunity|cells]] to perform their functions.

Nearly all organisms have some kind of immune system. [[Bacteria]] have a rudimentary immune system in the form of [[enzyme]]s that protect against [[bacteriophage|virus]] infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient [[eukaryote|plants and animals]] and remain in their modern descendants. These mechanisms include [[phagocytosis]], [[antimicrobial peptides]] called [[defensin]]s, and the [[complement system]]. [[Jawed vertebrate]]s, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an [[immunological memory]] leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of [[vaccination]].

On the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] side of a mountain, for example, air rises and cools, with water changing from gaseous to liquid or solid form, resulting in [[precipitation]] such as rain or snow.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014ao"/&gt; As a result, wet environments allow for lush vegetation to grow. In contrast, conditions tend to be dry on the leeward side of a mountain due to the lack of precipitation as air descends and warms, and moisture remains as water vapor in the atmosphere. [[Temperature]] and precipitation are the main factors that shape terrestrial [[biome]]s.

A [[Community (ecology)|community]] is a group of [[population]]s of two or more different [[species]] occupying the same geographical area at the same time. A [[biological interaction]] is the effect that a pair of [[organism]]s living together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions). These effects may be short-term, like [[pollination]] and [[predation]], or long-term; both often strongly influence the [[evolution]] of the species involved. A long-term interaction is called a [[symbiosis]]. Symbioses range from [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], beneficial to both partners, to [[competition (biology)|competition]], harmful to both partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wootton |first1=JT |last2=Emmerson |first2=M |title=Measurement of Interaction Strength in Nature |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=36|pages=419–44|year=2005|jstor=30033811 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.091704.175535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there are [[decomposer]]s that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014aq"/&gt;

On average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the [[biomass]] of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes.

In the global ecosystem (or [[biosphere]]), [[matter]] exist as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.&lt;ref name = hillisetal2014as"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hillis | first1 = David M. | last2 = Sadava | first2 = David | last3 = Hill | first3 = Richard W. | last4= Price | first4 = Mary V. | chapter = The distribution of Earth's ecological systems | title = Principles of Life | publisher = Sinauer Associates | edition = 2nd | date = 2014 | location = Sunderland, Mass. | pages = 916–934 | isbn = 978-1464175121}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A [[biogeochemical cycle]] is a pathway by which specific [[chemical element | element]]s of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic ([[biosphere]]) and the abiotic ([[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[hydrosphere]]) compartments of [[Earth]]. There are biogeochemical cycles for [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[carbon cycle|carbon]], and [[water cycle|water]]. In some cycles there are ''reservoirs'' where a substance remains or is [[:Wiktionary:sequestered|sequestered]] for a long period of time.

[[Climate change]] includes both global warming driven by human-induced emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Though there have been [[Climate variability and change|previous periods of climatic change]], since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth's climate system and caused change on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Summary for Policymakers|2013|p=4|ps=: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.
