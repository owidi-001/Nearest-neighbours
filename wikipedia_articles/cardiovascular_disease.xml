&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Cardiovascular disease''' ('''CVD''') is a class of diseases that involve the [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO2011"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Shanthi | last1 = Mendis| first2 = Pekka | last2 = Puska | first3 = Bo | last3 =Norrving | name-list-style = vanc |title=Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1|year=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|pages=3–18|isbn=978-92-4-156437-3|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817123106/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1|archive-date=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; CVD includes [[coronary artery disease]]s (CAD) such as [[angina pectoris|angina]] and [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly known as a heart attack).&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Other CVDs include [[stroke]], [[heart failure]], [[hypertensive heart disease]], [[rheumatic heart disease]], [[cardiomyopathy]], [[arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], [[congenital heart disease]], [[valvular heart disease]], [[carditis]], [[aortic aneurysm]]s, [[peripheral artery disease]], [[Thrombosis|thromboembolic disease]], and [[venous thrombosis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Types --&gt;
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease involve [[atherosclerosis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; This may be caused by [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[diabetes mellitus]], lack of [[physical exercise|exercise]], [[obesity]], [[hypercholesterolaemia|high blood cholesterol]], poor diet, excessive [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption,&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;  and poor [[sleep]],&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; among others. High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco accounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6% and obesity 5%.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated [[streptococcal pharyngitis|strep throat]].&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;

There are many cardiovascular diseases involving the blood vessels. They are known as [[vascular disease]]s.
* [[Coronary artery disease]] (also known as coronary heart disease and ischemic heart disease)
* [[Peripheral arterial disease]] – disease of blood vessels that supply blood to the arms and legs
* [[Cerebrovascular disease]] – disease of blood vessels that supply blood to the brain (includes [[stroke]])
* [[Renal artery stenosis]]
* [[Aortic aneurysm]]

There are also many cardiovascular diseases that involve the heart.
* [[Cardiomyopathy]] – diseases of cardiac muscle
* [[Hypertensive heart disease]] – diseases of the heart secondary to high [[blood pressure]] or [[hypertension]]
* [[Heart failure]] - a clinical syndrome caused by the inability of the heart to supply sufficient blood to the tissues to meet their metabolic requirements
* [[Pulmonary heart disease]] – a failure at the right side of the heart with respiratory system involvement
* [[Cardiac dysrhythmias]] – abnormalities of heart rhythm
* Inflammatory heart disease
** [[Endocarditis]] – [[inflammation]] of the inner layer of the heart, the [[endocardium]]. The structures most commonly involved are the [[heart valve]]s.
** Inflammatory [[cardiomegaly]]
** [[Myocarditis]] – inflammation of the [[myocardium]], the muscular part of the heart, caused most often by viral infection and less often by bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. It is characterized in part by infiltration of the heart by [[lymphocyte]] and [[monocyte]] types of [[white blood cells]].
** [[Eosinophilic myocarditis]] - inflammation of the myocardium caused by pathologically activated [[eosinophils|eosinophilic]] white blood cells. This disorder differs from myocarditis in its causes and treatments.
* [[Valvular heart disease]]
* [[Congenital heart disease]] – heart structure malformations existing at birth
* [[Rheumatic heart disease]] – heart muscles and valves damage due to [[rheumatic fever]] caused by  ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' a [[group A streptococcal infection]].

==Risk factors==
There are many risk factors for heart diseases: age, sex, tobacco use, physical inactivity, excessive [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption, unhealthy diet, obesity, genetic predisposition and family history of cardiovascular disease, raised blood pressure ([[hypertension]]), raised blood sugar ([[diabetes mellitus]]), raised blood cholesterol ([[hyperlipidemia]]), undiagnosed [[celiac disease]], psychosocial factors, poverty and low educational status, [[air pollution]] and poor [[sleep]].&lt;ref name = Fuster&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Bridget B. | last1 = Kelly | last2 = Fuster | first2 = Valentin | name-list-style = vanc |title=Promoting Cardiovascular Health in the Developing World: A Critical Challenge to Achieve Global Health |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-309-14774-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Finks SW, Airee A, Chow SL, Macaulay TE, Moranville MP, Rogers KC, Trujillo TC | title = Key articles of dietary interventions that influence cardiovascular mortality | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = e54-87 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22392596 | doi = 10.1002/j.1875-9114.2011.01087.x | s2cid = 36437057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MichaMichas2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MendisPuska2011"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Shanthi | last1 = Mendis | first2 = Pekka | last2 = Puska| first3 = Bo | last3 = Norrving | name-list-style = vanc |title=Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRbKygAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156437-3|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506235630/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRbKygAACAAJ|archive-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CiaccioLewis2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciaccio EJ, Lewis SK, Biviano AB, Iyer V, Garan H, Green PH | title = Cardiovascular involvement in celiac disease | journal = World Journal of Cardiology | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 652–666 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28932354 | pmc = 5583538 | doi = 10.4330/wjc.v9.i8.652 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the individual contribution of each risk factor varies between different communities or ethnic groups the overall contribution of these risk factors is very consistent.&lt;ref name = interheart&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yusuf S, Hawken S, Ounpuu S, Dans T, Avezum A, Lanas F, McQueen M, Budaj A, Pais P, Varigos J, Lisheng L | display-authors = 6 | title = Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): case-control study | journal = Lancet | volume = 364 | issue = 9438 | pages = 937–52 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15364185 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9 | s2cid = 30811593 | hdl = 10983/21615 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these risk factors, such as age, sex or family history/genetic predisposition, are immutable; however, many important cardiovascular risk factors are modifiable by lifestyle change, social change, drug treatment (for example prevention of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes).&lt;ref name = McPhee2012&gt;{{cite book | last = McPhee | first = Stephen | name-list-style = vanc | title = Current medical diagnosis &amp; treatment | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-07-176372-1 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/currentmedicaldi00step/page/430 430] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/currentmedicaldi00step/page/430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with obesity are at increased risk of [[atherosclerosis]] of the [[coronary arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eckel RH | title = Obesity and heart disease: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Nutrition Committee, American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 96 | issue = 9 | pages = 3248–50 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9386201 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.96.9.3248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
[[File:Calcified Heart.jpg|thumb|Calcified heart of an older woman with cardiomegaly]]

Age is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart diseases, with approximately a tripling of risk with each decade of life.&lt;ref name=Finegold&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Finegold JA, Asaria P, Francis DP | title = Mortality from ischaemic heart disease by country, region, and age: statistics from World Health Organisation and United Nations | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 168 | issue = 2 | pages = 934–45 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23218570 | pmc = 3819990 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.10.046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coronary fatty streaks can begin to form in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Adamo E, Guardamagna O, Chiarelli F, Bartuli A, Liccardo D, Ferrari F, Nobili V | title = Atherogenic dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk factors in obese children | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 2015 | pages = 912047 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25663838 | pmc = 4309297 | doi = 10.1155/2015/912047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 and older.&lt;ref&gt;"Understand Your Risk of Heart Attack". American Heart Association.http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/UnderstandYourRiskofHeartAttack/Understand-Your-Risk-of-Heart-Attack_UCM_002040_Article.jsp#&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after age 55.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Mensah, Mendis, et al. The Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke. World Health Organization. January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple explanations are proposed to explain why age increases the risk of cardiovascular/heart diseases. One of them relates to serum cholesterol level.&lt;ref name=Jou99&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jousilahti P, Vartiainen E, Tuomilehto J, Puska P | title = Sex, age, cardiovascular risk factors, and coronary heart disease: a prospective follow-up study of 14 786 middle-aged men and women in Finland | journal = Circulation | volume = 99 | issue = 9 | pages = 1165–72 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10069784 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.99.9.1165 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most populations, the serum total cholesterol level increases as age increases. In men, this increase levels off around age 45 to 50 years. In women, the increase continues sharply until age 60 to 65 years.&lt;ref name=Jou99/&gt;

Aging is also associated with changes in the mechanical and structural properties of the vascular wall, which leads to the loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance and may subsequently lead to coronary artery disease.&lt;ref name="autogenerated357"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jani B, Rajkumar C | title = Ageing and vascular ageing | journal = Postgraduate Medical Journal | volume = 82 | issue = 968 | pages = 357–62 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16754702 | pmc = 2563742 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.2005.036053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
{{see also|Cardiovascular disease in women}}
Men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women.&lt;ref name=Finegold/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors |title=Risk factors |access-date=2012-05-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510135600/http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors/ |archive-date=2012-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once past [[menopause]], it has been argued that a woman's risk is similar to a man's&lt;ref name=WHF/&gt; although more recent data from the WHO and UN disputes this.&lt;ref name=Finegold/&gt; If a female has diabetes, she is more likely to develop heart disease than a male with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/22/314869923/diabetes-raises-womens-risk-of-heart-disease-more-than-for-men|title=Diabetes raises women's risk of heart disease more than for men|work=NPR.org|date=May 22, 2014|access-date=May 23, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523093525/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/22/314869923/diabetes-raises-womens-risk-of-heart-disease-more-than-for-men|archive-date=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coronary heart diseases are 2 to 5 times more common among middle-aged men than women.&lt;ref name=Jou99/&gt;  In a study done by the [[World Health Organization]], sex contributes to approximately 40% of the variation in sex ratios of coronary heart disease mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson R, Chambles L, Higgins M, Kuulasmaa K, Wijnberg L, Williams D (WHO MONICA Project, and ARIC Study.) Sex difference in ischaemic heart disease mortality and risk factors in 46 communities:  an ecologic analysis. Cardiovasc Risk Factors. 1999; 7:43–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study reports similar results finding that sex differences explains nearly half the risk associated with cardiovascular diseases&lt;ref name=Jou99/&gt; One of the proposed explanations for sex differences in cardiovascular diseases is hormonal difference.&lt;ref name=Jou99/&gt;  Among women, estrogen is the predominant sex hormone. [[Estrogen]] may have protective effects on glucose metabolism and hemostatic system, and may have direct effect in improving [[endothelial]] cell function.&lt;ref name=Jou99/&gt;  The production of estrogen decreases after menopause, and this may change the female lipid metabolism toward a more atherogenic form by decreasing the [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol level while increasing LDL and total cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name=Jou99/&gt;

Among men and women, there are differences in body weight, height, body fat distribution, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial compliance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated357"/&gt; In the very elderly, age-related large artery pulsatility and stiffness is more pronounced among women than men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated357"/&gt; This may be caused by the women's smaller body size and arterial dimensions which are independent of menopause.&lt;ref name="autogenerated357"/&gt;

===Tobacco===
Cigarettes are the major form of smoked tobacco.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt; Risks to health from tobacco use result not only from direct consumption of tobacco, but also from exposure to second-hand smoke.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt; Approximately 10% of cardiovascular disease is attributed to smoking;&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt; however, people who quit smoking by age 30 have almost as low a risk of death as never smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doll R, Peto R, Boreham J, Sutherland I | title = Mortality in relation to smoking: 50 years' observations on male British doctors | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7455 | pages = 1519 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15213107 | pmc = 437139 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38142.554479.AE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical inactivity===
{{see|Sedentary lifestyle}}
Insufficient physical activity (defined as less than 5 x 30 minutes of moderate activity per week, or less than 3 x 20 minutes of vigorous activity per week) is currently the fourth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt;  In 2008, 31.3% of adults aged 15 or older (28.2% men and 34.4% women) were insufficiently physically active.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt;
The risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus is reduced by almost a third in adults who participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week (or equivalent).&lt;ref name="OrganizationUNAIDS2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=World Health Organization|author2=UNAIDS|title=Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AS2RmtQVuLwC&amp;pg=PT3|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-154726-0|pages=3–|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427013804/https://books.google.com/books?id=AS2RmtQVuLwC&amp;pg=PT3|archive-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, physical activity assists weight loss and improves blood glucose control, blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These effects may, at least in part, explain its cardiovascular benefits.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt;

===Diet===
{{See also|Lipid hypothesis|Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease|Salt and cardiovascular disease}}
High dietary intakes of saturated fat, trans-fats and salt, and low intake of fruits, vegetables and fish are linked to cardiovascular risk, although whether all these associations indicate causes is disputed. The World Health Organization attributes approximately 1.7 million deaths worldwide to low fruit and vegetable consumption.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt;  Frequent consumption of high-energy foods, such as processed foods that are high in fats and sugars, promotes obesity and may increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt;  The amount of dietary salt consumed may also be an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref name="WHO2011" /&gt;  There is moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hooper|first1=Lee|last2=Martin|first2=Nicole|last3=Jimoh|first3=Oluseyi F.|last4=Kirk|first4=Christian|last5=Foster|first5=Eve|last6=Abdelhamid|first6=Asmaa S.|date=21 August 2020|title=Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32827219|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=8|pages=CD011737|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011737.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=32827219|pmc=8092457|pmc-embargo-date=August 21, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; High [[trans-fat]] intake has adverse effects on blood lipids and circulating inflammatory markers,&lt;ref name="BookerMann2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Booker CS, Mann JI | title = Trans fatty acids and cardiovascular health: translation of the evidence base | journal = Nutrition, Metabolism, and Cardiovascular Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 448–56 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18468872 | doi = 10.1016/j.numecd.2008.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elimination of trans-fat from diets has been widely advocated.&lt;ref name="RemigFranklin2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Remig V, Franklin B, Margolis S, Kostas G, Nece T, Street JC | title = Trans fats in America: a review of their use, consumption, health implications, and regulation | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 585–92 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20338284 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2009.12.024 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 2097/6377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO plan to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fatty acids from global food supply|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-05-2018-who-plan-to-eliminate-industrially-produced-trans-fatty-acids-from-global-food-supply|website=World Health Organization|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the World Health Organization estimated that trans fats were the cause of more than half a million deaths per year.&lt;ref name="WHO2018" /&gt; There is evidence that higher consumption of sugar is associated with higher blood pressure and unfavorable blood lipids,&lt;ref name="Te MorengaHowatson2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Te Morenga LA, Howatson AJ, Jones RM, Mann J | title = Dietary sugars and cardiometabolic risk: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of the effects on blood pressure and lipids | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–79 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24808490 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.113.081521 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sugar intake also increases the risk of diabetes mellitus.&lt;ref&gt;"Wylie-Rosett2002"&lt;/ref&gt; High consumption of processed meats is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly in part due to increased dietary salt intake.&lt;ref name="MichaMichas2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Micha R, Michas G, Mozaffarian D | title = Unprocessed red and processed meats and risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes--an updated review of the evidence | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–24 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23001745 | pmc = 3483430 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-012-0282-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celiac disease===
Untreated [[celiac disease]] can cause the development of many types of cardiovascular diseases, most of which improve or resolve with a [[gluten-free diet]] and intestinal healing. However, delays in recognition and diagnosis of celiac disease can cause irreversible heart damage.&lt;ref name="CiaccioLewis2017" /&gt;

===Sleep===
Not betting good [[sleep]], in amount or quality, is documented as increasing cardiovascular risk in both adults and teens. Recommendations suggest that Infants typically need 12 or more hours of sleep per day, adolescent at least eight or nine hours, and adults seven or eight.  About one-third of adult Americans get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, and in a study of teenagers, just 2.2 percent of those studied got enough sleep, and many of those did not get good quality sleep.

An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from [[insomnia]], [[sleep apnea]] or other  chronic [[sleep disorders]].

In addition, sleep reseaerch displays differences in race and class. Short sleep and poor sleep tend to be more frequently reported in ethnic minorities than in  whites. African-Americans report experiencing short durations of sleep five times more often than whites, possibly as a result of social and environmental factors.  Black children and children in disadvantaged neighborhoods have much higher rates of sleep apnea than white children,&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Rui |last2=Dong |first2=Yan |last3=Weng |first3=Jia |last4=Kontos |first4=Emily Z. |last5=Chervin |first5=Ronald D. |last6=Rosen |first6=Carol L. |last7=Marcus |first7=Carole L. |last8=Redline |first8=Susan |title=Associations among Neighborhood, Race, and Sleep Apnea Severity in Children.

===Air pollution===
[[Particulate matter]] has been studied for its short- and long-term exposure [[Particulate matter#Health effects|effects on cardiovascular disease]]. Currently, airborne particles under 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) are the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk. Overall, long-term PM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In regards to short-term exposure (2 hours), every 25 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk.&lt;ref name="DOIthromres" /&gt; In addition, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic (2.8 mmHg) and diastolic (2.7 mmHg) blood pressure occurred for every 10.5 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="DOIthromres"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franchini M, Mannucci PM | title = Air pollution and cardiovascular disease | journal = Thrombosis Research | volume = 129 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–4 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22113148 | doi = 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.10.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research has implicated PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; in irregular heart rhythm, reduced heart rate variability (decreased vagal tone), and most notably heart failure.&lt;ref name="DOIthromres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doicirculationaha"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun Q, Hong X, Wold LE | title = Cardiovascular effects of ambient particulate air pollution exposure | journal = Circulation | volume = 121 | issue = 25 | pages = 2755–65 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20585020 | pmc = 2924678 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.893461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is also linked to [[carotid artery]] thickening and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.&lt;ref name="DOIthromres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doicirculationaha" /&gt;

===Depression and traumatic stress===
There is evidence that mental health problems, in particular depression and traumatic stress, is linked to cardiovascular diseases. Whereas mental health problems are known to be associated with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as smoking, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle, these factors alone do not explain the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases seen in depression, stress, and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen BE, Edmondson D, Kronish IM | title = State of the Art Review: Depression, Stress, Anxiety, and Cardiovascular Disease | journal = American Journal of Hypertension | volume = 28 | issue = 11 | pages = 1295–302 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 25911639 | pmc = 4612342 | doi = 10.1093/ajh/hpv047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] is independently associated with increased risk for incident coronary heart disease, even after adjusting for depression and other covariates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edmondson D, Kronish IM, Shaffer JA, Falzon L, Burg MM | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder and risk for coronary heart disease: a meta-analytic review | journal = American Heart Journal | volume = 166 | issue = 5 | pages = 806–14 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24176435 | pmc = 3815706 | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2013.07.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupational exposure ===
{{Main|Occupational cardiovascular disease}}
Little is known about the relationship between work and cardiovascular disease, but links have been established between certain toxins, extreme heat and cold, exposure to tobacco smoke, and mental health concerns such as stress and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/crcd/|title=CDC - NIOSH Program Portfolio : Cancer, Reproductive, and Cardiovascular Diseases : Program Description|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-07|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515221455/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/crcd/|archive-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-chemical risk factors====
A 2015 SBU-report looking at non-chemical factors found an association for those:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* with mentally stressful work with a lack of control over their working situation — with an effort-reward imbalance&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* who experience low social support at work; who experience injustice or experience insufficient opportunities for personal development; or those who experience job insecurity&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* those who work night schedules; or have long working weeks&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* those who are exposed to noise&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Specifically the risk of [[stroke]] was also increased by exposure to ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hypertension develops more often in those who experience job strain and who have shift-work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Differences between women and men in risk are small, however men risk suffering and dying of [[heart attack]]s or stroke twice as often as women during working life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/occupational-exposures-and-cardiovascular-disease/|title=Occupational Exposures and Cardiovascular Disease|author=[[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU)|website=www.sbu.se|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614063247/http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/occupational-exposures-and-cardiovascular-disease/|archive-date=2017-06-14|date=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemical risk factors====
A 2017 SBU report found evidence that workplace exposure to [[silica dust]], [[engine exhaust]] or [[welding fumes]] is associated with heart disease.&lt;ref name=SBU2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/occupational-health-and-safety--chemical-exposure/|title=Occupational health and safety – chemical exposure|author=[[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU)|website=www.sbu.se|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606093333/http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/occupational-health-and-safety--chemical-exposure/|archive-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associations also exist for exposure to [[arsenic]], [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzopyrenes]], [[lead]], [[dynamite]], [[Carbon disulfide|carbon disulphide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[Cutting fluid|metalworking fluids]] and occupational exposure to [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref name="SBU2017" /&gt; Working  with  the  [[electrolytic]] production of  aluminium  or  the  production  of  paper  when  the  sulphate pulping  process  is  used  is  associated with heart disease.&lt;ref name="SBU2017" /&gt; An association was also found  between  heart  disease  and  exposure  to  compounds  which  are  no  longer  permitted  in certain  work  environments,  such  as  [[phenoxy acid]]s containing [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]](dioxin) or [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name="SBU2017" /&gt;

Workplace exposure to silica dust or asbestos is also associated with [[pulmonary heart disease]]. There is evidence that workplace  exposure to lead, carbon disulphide, phenoxyacids containing  TCDD, as well as working in an environment where aluminum is being electrolytically produced, is associated with [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="SBU2017" /&gt;

=== Somatic mutations ===
As of 2017, evidence suggests that certain [[leukemia]]-associated [[mutation]]s in [[blood cell]]s may also lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Several large-scale research projects looking at human genetic data have found a robust link between the presence of these mutations, a condition known as [[clonal hematopoiesis]], and cardiovascular disease-related incidents and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jan M, Ebert BL, Jaiswal S | title = Clonal hematopoiesis | journal = Seminars in Hematology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–50 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28088988 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2016.10.002 | pmc = 8045769 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation therapy===

Population-based studies show that atherosclerosis, the major precursor of cardiovascular disease, begins in childhood.

This is extremely important considering that 1 in 3 people die from complications attributable to atherosclerosis. In order to stem the tide, education and awareness that cardiovascular disease poses the greatest threat, and measures to prevent or reverse this disease must be taken.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and in all regions except Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|last1=Shanthi|first1=Mendis|last2=Pekka|first2=Puska|last3=Bo|first3=Norrving| name-list-style = vanc |year=2011|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156437-3|oclc=796362754}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 30% of all global death was attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Death caused by cardiovascular diseases are also higher in low- and middle-income countries as over 80% of all global deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases occurred in those countries. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases each year.

It is estimated that 60% of the world's cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world's population. This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Organizations such as the [[Indian Heart Association]] are working with the [[World Heart Federation]] to raise awareness about this issue.&lt;ref name="Indian Heart"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sevith Roo|publisher=Indian Heart Association|title= Cardiac Disease Among South Asians: A Silent Epidemic|url=http://indianheartassociation.org/why-indians-why-south-asians/overview/  |access-date=2018-12-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111218/http://indianheartassociation.org/why-indians-why-south-asians/overview/ |archive-date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
