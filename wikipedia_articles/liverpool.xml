'''Liverpool''' is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[metropolitan borough]] in [[Merseyside]], [[England]], with a population in 2019 of {{English district population|GSS=E08000012}}, making it the [[List of English districts by population|tenth-largest English district by population]].&lt;ref&gt;The {{English statistics year}} population for Liverpool was {{English district population|GSS=E08000012}} according to the [[Office for National Statistics]] ({{English district population citation}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Labour Market Profile – Liverpool |work=nomisweb.co.uk |publisher=Original Source: Office for National Statistics |date=29 June 2018 |url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/1946157104/report.aspx#tabrespop |access-date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool's [[ESPON metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom|metropolitan area]] is the fifth-largest in the [[United Kingdom]], with a population of 2.24&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.espon.eu/sites/default/files/attachments/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119 |title=British urban pattern: population data|access-date=4 April 2021 |date=March 2007 |format=PDF |work=ESPON project 1.4.3 Study on Urban Functions |publisher=[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]] |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool is on the eastern side of the [[Mersey Estuary]] and historically lay within the ancient [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] of [[West Derby (hundred)|West Derby]] in the [[Historic counties of England|county]] of [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name=WestDerby&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10112606|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523153115/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10112606|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 May 2016 |title=Administrative Unit West Derby Hundred |author=University of Portsmouth |publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WestDerby2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41279 |title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 |author=William Farrer &amp; J. Brownbill |year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough in 1207]], a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city in 1880]], and a [[county borough]] independent of Lancashire in 1889. Its growth as a [[Port of Liverpool|major port]] was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Along with general cargo, freight, and raw materials such as coal and cotton, merchants were involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. In the 19th century, Liverpool was a major port of departure for English and Irish emigrants to [[North America]]. It was also home to both the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] and [[White Star Line]]s, and was the port of registry of the ocean liners {{RMS|Titanic}}, {{RMS|Lusitania}}, {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, and {{RMS|Olympic}}.

In 2019, Liverpool was ranked fifth on the list of the most visited UK cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/289010/top-50-uk-tourism-destinations/#:~:text=London%20is%20the%20most%20visited,three%20cities%20also%20ranked%20highest |title=Cities and towns in the United Kingdom (UK) ranked by international visits in 2019 |publisher=Statista|access-date=7 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted for its [[Culture of Liverpool|culture]], [[Architecture of Liverpool|architecture]], and [[Transport in Liverpool|transport links]]. The city is closely associated with music; the popularity of [[the Beatles]] led to it becoming a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=You Really Got Me: The Story of The Kinks |first=Nick |last=Hasted |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2017 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool has continued to produce [[Music of Liverpool|notable musicians]] and record {{nowrap|labels—musicians}} from the city have produced 56 [[List of best-selling singles|No. 1 hit singles]], more than any other city in the world.&lt;ref name="no1singles1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="no1singles2" /&gt; It also has a long-standing reputation as the origin of [[:Category:Actors from Liverpool|actors and actresses]], [[:Category:Artists from Liverpool|artists]], [[:Category:Sportspeople from Liverpool|athletes]], [[:Category:Comedians from Liverpool|comedians]], [[:Category:Journalists from Liverpool|journalists]], [[:Category:Novelists from Liverpool|novelists]], and [[:Category:Poets from Liverpool|poets]]. The city has the second-highest number of art galleries, national museums, [[Listed buildings in Liverpool|listed buildings]], and [[Parks and open spaces in Liverpool|listed parks]] in the UK; only the capital, [[London]], has more.&lt;ref name=visitliverpool /&gt; The former [[Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City]] includes the [[Pier Head]], [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]], and [[William Brown Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City |publisher=UK Local Authority World Heritage Forum |url=http://www.lawhf.gov.uk/LAWHF/liverpool.htm |access-date=9 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423041054/http://www.lawhf.gov.uk/LAWHF/liverpool.htm |archive-date=23 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sports, the city is best known for being the home of [[Premier League]] football teams [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool FC]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton FC]], with matches between the two being known as the [[Merseyside derby]]. The annual [[Grand National]] horse race takes place at [[Aintree Racecourse]].

Several areas of [[Liverpool city centre]] carried [[World Heritage Site]] status from 2004 until 2021, and the city's vast collection of parks and open spaces has been described as the "most important in the country" by England's [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/mcs/lfs/consultations/blandfordlet0205.pdf |title=Dr. Peter Brown, chair, Merseyside Civic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its status as a port city historically attracted a diverse population from a wide range of cultures, primarily [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Norway]], and [[Wales]]. It is also home to the [[Black people in Liverpool|oldest black community in the UK]] and the [[Chinatown, Liverpool|oldest Chinese community in Europe]]. Natives of Liverpool (and occasionally longtime residents) are formally referred to as "Liverpudlians" but are more often called "Scousers", a reference to [[Scouse (food)|the form of stew]] made popular by sailors in the city, which also became the most common name for the [[Scouse|local accent and dialect]]. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007 and was named the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]], which it shared with the Norwegian city of [[Stavanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/pdf/doc1155_en.pdf |title=Report on the Nominations from the UK and Norway for the European Capital of Culture 2008|access-date=11 July 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819212038/http://ec.europa.eu/culture/pdf/doc1155_en.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its designation as European Capital of Culture resulted in a sharp uptick in the city's fortunes, as the money gained from the EU was spent on regenerating large parts of the city that had become run down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.financedigest.com/liverpool-european-capital-of-culture-2008-2018.html |title=Liverpool, European Capital of Culture: 2008 – 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==

Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form “Leverpool” with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) &gt; Danetry, never-do-well &gt; ne’er-do-well).

In the nineteenth century, some Welsh publications used the name “Lle’r Pwll” (“(the) place (of) the pool”), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that “Lle’r Pwll” was the original form.

Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a nineteenth-century coining. “Llyn” is pool, but “lleifiad” has no obvious meaning.  Professor G. Melville Richards (1910‐1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in “Place Names of North Wales”,&lt;ref name="Place-Names of North Wales"&gt;{{ |title= Place-Names of North Wales by G. Melville Richards (Liverpool, 1953). “A Scientific Survey of Merseyside” pp 242–250|publisher=British Association | }}&lt;/ref&gt; does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that “lleifiad” is used as a Welsh equivalent of “Liver”.

A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lāma (slough, bog, fen) to give “lleifiad” is possible, but unproven.

[[John of England|King John]]'s [[letters patent]] of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memorials of Liverpool |volume=1.

The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a [[royal charter]], making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in an H shape: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).

In the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the [[English Civil War]], including an eighteen-day siege in 1644.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1699, the same year as its first recorded [[slave ship]], ''Liverpool Merchant'', set sail for Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool's Slavery History Trail |publisher=Lodging-World.com |date=16 August 2017 |url=https://www.lodging-world.com/blog/liverpools-slavery-history-trail |access-date=16 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817214544/https://www.lodging-world.com/blog/liverpools-slavery-history-trail/ |archive-date=17 August 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool was made a parish by [[Act of Parliament]], although arguably the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Transactions of the Historical Society of Lancashire and Cheshire |title=Creating a Port: Liverpool 1695–1715 |first=Michael |last=Power |volume=149 |year=1999 |pages=51–71 |url=https://www.hslc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/149-4-Power.pdf |access-date=31 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831041026/https://www.hslc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/149-4-Power.pdf |archive-date=31 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Roman times, the nearby city of [[Chester]] on the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] had been the region's principal port on the [[Irish Sea]]. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring [[River Mersey]].

As trade from the [[West Indies]], including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial [[wet dock]] was built in Liverpool in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lost Dock of Liverpool |publisher=Channel 4: Time Team, 21 April 2008 |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/liverpool/liverpool-found.html |access-date=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Liverpool Dock System |publisher=New York Times, 2 January 1898 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFD91039E433A25751C0A9679C94699ED7CF |access-date=2 June 2008 |date=2 January 1898}} Note: "pdf" reader needed to see full article&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial profits from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including [[William Rathbone IV|William Rathbone]], [[William Roscoe]] and [[Edward Rushton]], were at the forefront of the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|local abolitionist movement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===19th century===
By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and [[Manchester]] became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|Great Famine]].

Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the [[Deep South]] of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the [[American Civil War]] Liverpool was, in the words of historian [[Sven Beckert]], "the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Empire of Cotton: a Global History |last=Beckert |first=Sven |publisher=Knopf |year=2014 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the [[Antarctic]] [[seal hunting|sealing]] industry, in recognition of which [[Liverpool Beach]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]] is named after the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137191 Liverpool Beach.] [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica|SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1851 the city was described as "the New York of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Bankers' Magazine |publisher=Groombridge &amp; Sons |location=London |series=v.11 |year=1851 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC05AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=new-york-of-europe&amp;pg=PA783}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was attracting [[immigrants]] from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The [[German Church, Liverpool|Deutsche Kirche Liverpool]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas]], [[Gustav Adolf Church, Liverpool|Gustav Adolf Church]] and [[Princes Road Synagogue]] were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool|St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church]], served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship.

===20th century===
The postwar period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to integrate veterans into the economy. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including [[British police strikes in 1918 and 1919|police strikes in London]] among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the UK, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing.

In this period, race riots also took place in [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], and there had been incidents in [[Glasgow]], [[South Shields]], [[London]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]].&lt;ref name=Tabili&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/840 Dr Laura Tabili, "Review of Jacqueline Jenkinson, ''Black 1919: Riots, Racism and Resistance in Imperial Britain,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, 2009], {{ISBN|9781846312007}}", ''Reviews in History'' website, accessed 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, racial riots of whites against blacks took place across the United States in numerous industrial cities,&lt;ref name=Tabili/&gt; so that a black leader termed the period of time [[Red Summer]]. In that first postwar year, there were also riots in Caribbean and South African cities.&lt;ref name=Tabili/&gt;
[[File:Titanic in color.png|left|thumb|Liverpool was the port of registry of the ill-fated ocean liner [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]. The ship sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912, with the loss of 1,517 lives (including numerous Liverpudlians). A [[Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic]] is located on the city's waterfront.]]
The [[Housing Act 1919]] resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families were relocated from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though this is largely subjective. Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city.

Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both [[Hitler]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz]] second only to London's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.asp |title=Spirit of the Blitz : Liverpool in the Second World War |publisher=[[Liverpool Museums]] |year=2003 |access-date=13 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606081949/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.asp |archive-date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pivotal [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/info-sheet.aspx?sheetId=4 |title=Merseyside Maritime Museum, Sheet No. 4: Battle of the Atlantic |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date=3 September 1939 |access-date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' made 80&amp;nbsp;[[Liverpool Blitz|air raids on Merseyside]], killing 2,500&amp;nbsp;people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the [[Seaforth Dock]], the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction of the city centre has been deeply unpopular. It was as flawed as much subsequent town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with [[Cologne]], Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war.

A significant [[West Indies|West Indian]] black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area.  More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as [[Toxteth]], where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The ethnic population of England and Wales broken down by local authority|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210723001845/https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/18/ethnic-population-england-wales|url-status=live|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of suburban public housing expanded after the Second World War. Some of the older inner-city areas were redeveloped for new homes.

In the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the "[[Beat music|Merseybeat]]" sound, which became synonymous with [[the Beatles]] and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music for years and were internationally popular. The [[Beatles]] became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed for years together; they were the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer [[John Lennon]] was killed in New York City in 1980 after the Beatles stopped performing together. Liverpool airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.&lt;ref name=fola&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Friends of Liverpool Airport |url=http://www.fola.org.uk/current.html |title=Recent History and Current Developments |access-date=10 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624063000/http://www.fola.org.uk/current.html |archive-date=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airports Named For Celebrities |url=http://www.airportparkingmarket.co.uk/airports-named-for-celebrities/ |website=Airport Parking Market|access-date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously part of [[Lancashire]], and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool in 1974 became a [[metropolitan borough]] within the newly created [[metropolitan county]] of [[Merseyside]].

From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional [[manufacturing industries]] declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of [[containerisation]] meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/liverpool.html |title=A History of Liverpool |publisher=Localhistories.org |access-date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gJJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1176,3408501&amp;dq=liverpool+million+unemployment&amp;hl=en |title=Number of people unemployed at three-million mark in Britain |work=The Leader-Post ([[Google News Archive]]) |date=28 January 1982|access-date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. Since the mid-1990s the city has enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average.
[[File:Mathew Street Liverpool.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mathew Street]] is one of many tourist attractions related to the Beatles, and the location of Europe's largest annual free [[Liverpool Mathew Street Music Festival|music festival]].]] At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration,&lt;!-- in what way? --&gt; a process that continues today.

===21st century===
To celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] in 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] organised a competition to choose [[county flower]]s; the [[Eryngium maritimum|sea-holly]] was Liverpool's final choice.

Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as [[the Beatles]], as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy.

In 2004, property developer [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor]] started the [[Liverpool One|Paradise Project]], a £920&amp;nbsp;m development based on [[Paradise Street, Liverpool|Paradise Street]]. This produced the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 'Liverpool ONE,' the centre opened in May 2008.

In 2007, the city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool, for which a number of events were planned. Liverpool was designated as a joint [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 2008, included the erection of [[La Princesse]], a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, and represents the "eight legs" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. [[La Princesse]] roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the [[Queensway Tunnel]].

Spearheaded by the multi-billion-[[Pound sterling|pound]] Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued through to the start of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects include new buildings in the [[Liverpool City Centre#Commercial District|Commercial District]], the [[King's Dock, and areas of Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]], [[Mann Island]], the [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street Gateway]], the [[Baltic Triangle]], the [[RopeWalks, Liverpool|RopeWalks]], and the [[Edge Lane|Edge Lane Gateway]]. All projects could be eclipsed by the [[Liverpool Waters]] scheme, which if built will cost in the region of £5.5billion and be one of the largest [[megaproject]]s in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from such groups as [[UNESCO]], which claimed that it would adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status.

In June 2014, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] launched the [[International Festival for Business]] in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifb2014.com/Quick-Guide-to-IFB-2014-i25.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625135233/http://ifb2014.com/Quick-Guide-to-IFB-2014-i25.html |archive-date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest in the UK since the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/david-cameron-international-festival-business-7235969 ''[[Liverpool Echo]]''], David Cameron's speech&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2021, Liverpool lost its World Heritage status, UNESCO citing the [[Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium]] and [[Liverpool Waters]] projects as not being in keeping with a World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-57879475 Liverpool stripped of Unesco World Heritage status] ''BBC News'' 21 July 2021&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Josh Halliday |title=Unesco strips Liverpool of its world heritage status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/21/unesco-strips-liverpool-waterfront-world-heritage-status |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=21 July 2021 |date=21 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]] built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, [[Oriel Chambers]], which was a prototype of the [[skyscraper]]. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R.

Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival.

In 1889, borough engineer [[John Alexander Brodie]] invented the football goal net. He also was a pioneer in the use of [[pre-fabricated]] housing and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road ([[A5058 road|A5058]]) and intercity highway ([[East Lancashire Road]]), as well as the [[Queensway Tunnel]] linking Liverpool and [[Birkenhead]]. Described as "the eighth wonder of the world" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years.

In 1897, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] filmed Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i5ApsjD46o Liverpool Scenes 1896/1897] ''YouTube''&lt;/ref&gt; including what is believed to be the world's first [[tracking shot]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/News/newsdetail_2754.asp Liverpool City Council] News, 14 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]], the world's first elevated electrified railway.

==Government==
{{See also|Merseyside|Liverpool City Region}}
For the purposes of [[Local government in England|local government]], the city of Liverpool is classified as a [[Metropolitan borough|metropolitan borough]]. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of [[Merseyside]] and the [[Liverpool City Region]]. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each. 

[[Liverpool City Council]] is the governing body solely for the city of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English [[Unitary Authority]]. 
The [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] reserves major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the local area. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool devolution deal |publisher=Gov.uk |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-devolution-deal |access-date=18 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance outside of these two structures. Liverpool was administered by [[Merseyside County Council]] between 1974 to 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the [[Merseyside Police|police]] and [[Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service|fire and rescue service]], continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool City Region explained and how it's different to Merseyside |date=28 December 2020 |publisher=Liverpool Echo |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-city-region-explained-how-19427821 |access-date=18 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also elects four [[member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

===Three Mayors===

The City of Liverpool is governed by three separate Mayors each with their own distinct functions and powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-three-mayors-what-do-15581770 |title=Why does Liverpool have THREE mayors?

====Directly Elected Mayor of Liverpool====

{{See also|Liverpool City Council}}
[[File:LpoolTownHallOM.jpg|thumb|left|The late Georgian [[Liverpool Town Hall]]]]
The [[Directly elected mayor of Liverpool|Mayor of Liverpool]] is directly elected by the public every four years to lead [[Liverpool City Council]]. The figure is responsible for directing the City Council's policies and appoints cabinet members to run key council functions such as education and housing. The council's 90 elected [[councillors]] who represent local communities throughout the city, are responsible for scrutinising the mayor's decisions, setting the budget, and policy framework of the city. The Mayor's responsibility is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/voting-and-elections/Mayoral-elections-2012/The-role-of-mayor |title=The role of mayor |date=May 2012 |access-date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503044536/http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/voting-and-elections/Mayoral-elections-2012/The-role-of-mayor/ |archive-date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government ministers and the Prime Minister through his seat at the Cabinet of Mayors. Discussions include pressing decision-makers in the government on local issues as well as building relationships with the other [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/apr/27/cabinet-mayors-local-authorities-analysis |title=Cabinet of mayors proves controversial offer to local authorities |date=27 April 2012 | access-date=7 May 2012 |work=The Guardian |first=Rosie |last=Niven |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Mayor is [[Joanne Anderson]].

====Lord Mayor of Liverpool====

This role is the oldest of the three mayors and is mostly ceremonial. The Lord Mayor is chosen only by councillors within Liverpool City Council, not the general public, and serves a one year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the 'first citizen' and chosen representative of the city. They represent the city at functions, promote it to the wider world and attend religious ceremonies. They also have the key task of chairing full council meetings and can choose a number of charities to support throughout their term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-committees-and-meetings/lord-mayor |title=Role of the Lord Mayor |date=May 2012 |access-date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508201615/https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-committees-and-meetings/lord-mayor/ |archive-date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region====

The City of Liverpool is one of the six constituent local government districts of the [[Liverpool City Region]]. The [[Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region]] is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]].
The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Metro Mayor is Steve Rotheram.

===City Council and MPs===

For local elections the city is split into 30 local council wards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ward Profiles |publisher=Liverpool City Council |url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Business/Economic_development/Key_Statistics_and_Data/Ward_profiles/index.asp |access-date=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301161644/http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Business/Economic_development/Key_statistics_and_data/Ward_profiles/index.asp |archive-date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in alphabetical order are:

During the local elections [[2011 Liverpool Council election|held in May 2011]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from regaining power for the first time in 12 years, during the [[2010 Liverpool Council election|previous elections in May 2010]].&lt;ref name="Liverpool Liberal Democrats being wiped out in Local Government elections 2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool Liberal Democrats being wiped out in Local Government elections 2011 |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/05/06/liverpool-liberal-democrats-being-wiped-out-in-local-government-elections-2011-100252-28644711/ |newspaper=Liverpool Echo|access-date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party gained 11 seats during the election, taking their total to 62 seats, compared with the 22 held by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Of the remaining seats, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] won three and [[Green Party of England and Wales|the Green Party]] claimed two. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], one of the three major political parties in the UK had no representation on Liverpool City Council.&lt;ref name="Liverpool Liberal Democrats being wiped out in Local Government elections 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="England Council Elections: Liverpool"&gt;{{cite news |title=England Council Elections: Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/council/html/by.stm |work=BBC News|access-date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall on Capital of Culture funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coligan |first=Nick |title=Official: Liverpool city council is worst – yes, the WORST – in the country |website=[[Liverpool Echo]] |date=7 February 2008 |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/02/07/official-liverpool-city-council-is-worst-yes-the-worst-in-the-country-100252-20446758/ |access-date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a municipal stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies of prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] after her [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/07/21/the-real-legacy-of-margaret-thatcher-is-a-nation-divided-100252-21375195/ |title=The real legacy of Margaret Thatcher is a nation divided |website=Liverpool Echo |date=21 July 2008 |access-date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the [[Winter of Discontent]] (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3067563.stm |work=BBC News |first=Paul |last=Wilenius |title=Enemies within: Thatcher and the unions |date=5 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parliamentary constituencies and MPs====
{{See also|List of Parliamentary constituencies on Merseyside}}
Liverpool has four [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]] entirely within the city, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]: [[Liverpool Riverside (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Riverside]], [[Liverpool Walton (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Walton]], [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] and [[Liverpool West Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool West Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool Members of Parliament |publisher=Liverpool City Council |url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Council_government_and_democracy/MPs_and_MEPs/Liverpool_MPs/index.asp |access-date=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907071841/https://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Council_government_and_democracy/MPs_and_MEPs/Liverpool_MPs/index.asp |archive-date=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|last general election]], all were won by Labour with representation being from [[Kim Johnson (politician)|Kim Johnson]], [[Dan Carden]], [[Paula Barker]] and [[Ian Byrne (politician)|Ian Byrne]] respectively.&lt;ref name="2019 general election results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Merseyside bucks national trend with Labour wins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50769682 |access-date=22 December 2019 |date=13 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Constituencies in the United Kingdom general election, 2010|boundary changes]] prior to the 2010 election, the [[Liverpool Garston (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Garston]] constituency was merged with most of [[Knowsley South (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley South]] to form the [[Garston and Halewood (UK Parliament constituency)|Garston and Halewood]] cross-boundary seat. At the most 2019 election this seat was won by [[Maria Eagle]] of the Labour Party.&lt;ref name="2019 general election results" /&gt;

[[File:Liverpool Bay.png|thumb|[[Satellite imagery]] showing [[Liverpool Bay]], Liverpool and the wider [[Merseyside]] area]]
Liverpool has been described as having "the most splendid setting of any English city."&lt;ref&gt;The Buildings of England – Lancashire: Liverpool and the Southwest By Richard Pollard, Nikolaus Pevsner, Yale University Press, 2006, p243&lt;/ref&gt; At {{Coord|53|24|0|N|2|59|0|W|type:city}} (53.4, −2.98), {{convert|176|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} northwest of London, located on the [[Liverpool Bay]] of the [[Irish Sea]] the city of Liverpool is built across a ridge of [[sandstone]] hills rising up to a height of around 230&amp;nbsp;feet (70&amp;nbsp;m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the [[West Lancashire Coastal Plain]].

The [[Mersey Estuary]] separates Liverpool from the [[Wirral Peninsula]]. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to [[Bootle]], [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] and [[Maghull]] in south [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]] to the north, and [[Kirkby]], [[Huyton]], [[Prescot]] and [[Halewood]] in [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]] to the east.

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Liverpool}}
Liverpool experiences a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and Temperature records have been kept at Bidston since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224035445/http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/ |archive-date=24 February 2011 |title=Historical weather data for Bidston Observatory |access-date=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bidston closed down in 2002 but the [[Met Office]] also has a weather station at [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]]. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from {{convert|-17.9|C|F}} on 19 December 2010 to {{convert|34.5|C|F}} on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of {{convert|35.0|C|F}} on 19 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/2006/ws-33233.html |title=Climate Liverpool Airport (Year 2006) – Climate data (33233) |work=En.tutiempo.net |access-date=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bidston Observatory recorded hours of sunshine |url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/sunshinehours.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125731/http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/sunshinehours.pdf|archive-date=9 July 2011|access-date=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldweatheronline.com/liverpool-weather/merseyside/gb.aspx |title=Liverpool Monthly Climate Averages |website=WorldWeatherOnline.com|access-date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/1998/ws-33233.html |title=Climate Liverpool Airport (Year 1998) – Climate data (33233) |work=En.tutiempo.net |access-date=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Georgia Morgan |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/official-tornado-spotted-m53-motorway-7906550 |title=Official: Tornado spotted on M53 motorway in Wirral |work=Liverpool Echo |date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gctb66ydw |title=Crosby climate information |publisher=Met Office |date=1 May 2014 |access-date=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare.

Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded {{convert|221.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain and the driest being February 1932, with {{convert|0.9|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{Cite web |date=9 July 2011 |title=Bidston Observatory recorded hours of rainfall (mm) |url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/monthlyrainfall.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125732/http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/monthlyrainfall.pdf|archive-date=9 July 2011|access-date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driest year on record was 1991, with {{convert|480.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with {{convert|1159.9|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/IO_d643dae6-3dfe-4b58-bbf7-dc91d00bbfdf/ |title=TYRain_1677-1859_A_pt1|access-date=25 September 2020 |publisher=Met Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Green Liverpool====
In 2010 Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust Commissioned [[The Mersey Forest]] to complete "A Green Infrastructure Strategy" for the city.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Green Infrastructure Strategy – ginw.co.uk/liverpool&lt;/ref&gt;

====Green belt====
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Liverpool is a core urban element of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Draft Liverpool Local Plan September 2016 |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/media/1355685/the-draft-liverpool-local-plan-september-2016-bc.pdf |website=liverpool.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] throughout the borough, at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.&lt;ref name="belt2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool City Council – Draft Liverpool Local Plan – 12 Green Infrastructure |url=http://consult.liverpool.gov.uk/portal/draft_liverpool_local_plan?pointId=s1429871636491#section-s1429871636491 |website=consult.liverpool.gov.uk}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Knowsley and Sefton Green Belt Study Nov 2012 |url=http://www.knowsley.gov.uk/pdf/eb08_knowsleyandseftongreenbeltstudy.pdf |website=www.knowsley.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the size in the city amounts to {{convert|530|ha|km2+sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics |website=www.gov.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
{{Main|Demography of Liverpool}}

===Population===
====The city====
At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]] the recorded population of Liverpool was 466,415, a 6.1% increase on the figure of 439,473 recorded in the 2001 census.&lt;ref name=2011pop&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/media/128898/Full-report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205164151/http://liverpool.gov.uk/media/128898/Full-report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 February 2016 |title=2011 Census: Liverpool Summary |publisher=Liverpool City Council |access-date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the central Liverpool local authority peaked in the 1930s with 846,101 recorded in the 1931 census, before suburbanisation and the establishment of [[new towns]] in the region.&lt;ref name="populationhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10105821/cube/TOT_POP |title=Liverpool District: Total Population |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=University of Portsmouth|access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many British cities including [[London]] and [[Manchester]], the city centre covered by the Liverpool council area had experienced negative population growth since the 1931 census. Much of the population loss was as a result of large-scale resettlement programmes to nearby areas introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, with satellite towns such as [[Kirkby, Merseyside|Kirkby]], [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Runcorn]] seeing a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ravetz |first1=Alison |title=Council housing and culture |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-415-23945-5 |edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool's population is younger than that of England as a whole, with {{#expr:5.6+2.9+1.9+5.2+1.2+2.3+3.9+10.9+8.6}} per cent of its population under the age of 30, compared to an English average of {{#expr:6.3+3.4+2.2+5.8+1.2+2.5+2.6+6.9+6.8}} per cent.&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=1946157104|title=Liverpool Local Authority|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;br /&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=2092957699|title=England Country|fewer-links=yes|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014|07}}, 66 per cent of the population was of working age.&lt;ref name=age/&gt;

====Urban and metropolitan area====
Liverpool is the largest local authority by population, GDP and area in Merseyside. Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Liverpool is defined as a standalone [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|NUTS3 area by the ONS for statistical purpose]], and makes up part of the NUTS2 area "Merseyside" along with East Merseyside (Knowsley, St Helens and Halton), Sefton and the Wirral. The population of this area was 1,513,306 based on 2014 estimates.

The "[[Liverpool Urban Area]]" is a term used by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) to denote the [[urban area]] around the city to the east of the [[River Mersey]]. The contiguous built-up area extends beyond the area administered by [[Liverpool City Council]] into adjoining local authority areas, particularly parts of [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]]. As defined by ONS, the area extends as far east as [[Haydock]] and [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]]. Unlike the Metropolitan area, the Urban Area does not include The Wirral or its contiguous areas.&lt;ref name="UrbanArea"&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool Urban Area |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/liverpool_urban_area.asp |access-date=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of this area as of 2011 was 864,211.

The "[[Liverpool City Region]]" is an economic partnership between local authorities in Merseyside under the umbrella of the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] as defined by the Mersey Partnership. The area covers Merseyside and the [[Borough of Halton]] and has an estimated population between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 and.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |title=Liverpool City Region: Development Programme Report 2006 |url=http://www.merseyside.org.uk/dbimgs/LCRD_44pp.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718022646/http://www.merseyside.org.uk/dbimgs/LCRD_44pp.pdf|archive-date=18 July 2011|access-date=13 July 2010 |publisher=The Mersey Partnership |location=Liverpool |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 ESPON (now ([[European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion]]) released a study defining a "Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area" as a functional urban area consisting of contiguous urban areas, labour pool, and commuter "Travel To Work Areas". The analysis grouped the [[Merseyside]] metropolitan county with the borough of [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], [[Wigan]] in Greater Manchester, the city of [[Chester]] as well as number of towns in Lancashire and [[Cheshire]] including [[Ormskirk]] and [[Warrington]], estimating the polynuclear metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119 |title=British urban pattern: population data|access-date=14 May 2012 |date=March 2007 |format=PDF |website=ESPON project 1.4.3 Study on Urban Functions |publisher=[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]] |page=119|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002318/http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119|archive-date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:89997 |title=Shrinking cities and growing regions – emerging trends of new rural-urban relationships in the UK and Germany (Manchester eScholar – The University of Manchester) |publisher=Escholar.manchester.ac.uk |access-date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1122670315&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=-81&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=adhoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;va=&amp;pt=a |title=World Gazetteer: United Kingdom – largest cities (per geographical entity) |publisher=Archive.is |access-date=5 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105182544/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1122670315&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=-81&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=adhoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;va=&amp;pt=a |archive-date=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/23/ruralaffairs.britishidentity |work=The Guardian |first=Martin |last=Wainwright |title=Seeking peace and quiet?

Some  Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Costello |first=Ray |title=Black Liverpool: The Early History of Britain's Oldest Black Community 1730–1918 |publisher=Picton Press |location=Liverpool |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-873245-07-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.&lt;ref name="McIntyre-Brown"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McIntyre-Brown |first=Arabella |author2=Woodland, Guy |title=Liverpool: The First 1,000 Years |publisher=Garlic Press |location=Liverpool |year=2001 |page=57 |isbn=978-1-904099-00-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large [[British African-Caribbean people|African-Caribbean]],&lt;ref name=ethnicity/&gt; [[Ghanaians in the United Kingdom|Ghanaian]],&lt;ref name=IOMGhanaians&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iomlondon.org/doc/mapping/IOM_GHANA.pdf |title=Ghana Mapping Exercise |publisher=International Organization for Migration |access-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145035/http://www.iomlondon.org/doc/mapping/IOM_GHANA.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Somalis in the United Kingdom|Somali]]&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408051421/http://www.liverpoolpct.nhs.uk/Library/Impact/IA0073.doc&lt;/ref&gt; communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations.

The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's [[Chinatown, Liverpool|Chinatown]] arrived as seamen in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Chinese"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1369 |title=Culture and Ethnicity Differences in Liverpool – Chinese Community |publisher=Chambré Hardman Trust |access-date=6 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724204513/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1369 |archive-date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. [[Lita Roza]], a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry.

===Religion===
[[File:Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool - geograph.org.uk - 1304.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King]]]]
The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=51 |title=Church, Mosque, Synagogue |publisher=Liverpool Street Gallery |date=2 December 2007 |access-date=15 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118220910/http://www.liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=51 |archive-date=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including two Christian cathedrals.

Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.&lt;ref name="Sectarianism in England"&gt;{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Ed |title=Why does England not have sectarianism like Scotland and Northern Ireland? It's the demography, stupid |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100084758/why-does-england-not-have-sectarianism-like-scotland-its-the-demography-stupid/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424083701/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100084758/why-does-england-not-have-sectarianism-like-scotland-its-the-demography-stupid/|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 April 2011 |website=The Telegraph|access-date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|Our Lady and St Nicholas]], colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the [[Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas]] (built in the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]] style), and the [[Gustav Adolf Church, Liverpool|Gustav Adolf Church]] (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).

Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]], which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual [[Liverpool Shakespeare Festival]], has one of the longest [[nave]]s, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]], on Mount Pleasant next to [[Liverpool Science Park]], was initially planned to be even larger. Of [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]]'s original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]]. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design it still incorporates the largest panel of [[stained glass]] in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]], a coincidence which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as "Paddy's Wigwam" due to its shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2007/05/10/faith_metro_cathedral_anniv_feature.shtml |title=Cathedral celebrates anniversary |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The term may have its origins in religious and racial [[sectarianism]], which, while now largely disappeared, was once notoriously virulent in Liverpool.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-Rahma Mosque, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Al-Rahma Mosque]] in the Toxteth area of Liverpool]]
Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed [[Moorish Revival]] [[Princes Road Synagogue]] is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's [[Moorish Revival]] synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples, Joseph, Pevsner Architectural Guide to Liverpool, Yale University Press, 2004, p249&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant [[Jewish]] community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the [[Greenbank Park]] area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a [[Lubavitch]] [[Chabad House]] and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooljewish.com/community/history-liverpool-jewry-today.php |title=Liverpool Jewry Today|access-date=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liverpool Talmudical College]] existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.

Liverpool also has a [[Hindu]] community, with a [[Mandir]] on [[Edge Lane]], [[Edge Hill, Merseyside|Edge Hill]]. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcoliverpool.com/ |title=Shri Radha Krishna Temple – (Hindu Cultural Organisation, Liverpool) |publisher=Hcoliverpool.com |access-date=5 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207213503/http://hcoliverpool.com/ |archive-date=7 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool also has the [[Guru Nanak]] [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwara]] in [[Wavertree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wellington Ave |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;cp=27&amp;gs_id=3&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=wellington+avenue+liverpool&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x487b2052fc14d2b7:0x7f95f042f87001c6,Wellington+Ave,+Liverpool,+Merseyside+L15&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=SzAvTqaGHIif-QbemI3LDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ8gEwAg |title=Google Maps – Guru Nanak Gurdwara &amp; Sikh Community Centre, Wellington Avenue, Liverpool, Merseyside, L15 0EJ |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]] Centre in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~njtrg/Bahai/Liverpool%20Bahai%20Text.html |title=Liverpool Baha'is Online – Liverpool Baha'i Centre and Community |publisher=Users.globalnet.co.uk |date=14 April 1950 |access-date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city had the earliest mosque in England, and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by [[William Abdullah Quilliam]], a lawyer who had converted to [[Islam]], and set up the [[Liverpool Muslim Institute]] in a [[terraced house]] on West Derby Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islaminbritishstone.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=68 ''Islam In British Stone''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530060202/http://www.islaminbritishstone.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=68 |date=30 May 2012 }} website&lt;/ref&gt; The building was used as a house of worship until 1908, when it was sold to the City Council and converted into offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Architectural Heritage – The 'little mosque' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/liverpool/article_2.shtml |author=Lousie Sardais |publisher=BBC|access-date=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans have been accepted to re-convert the building where the mosque once stood into a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Architectural Heritage – The 'little mosque' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/liverpool/article_1.shtml |author=Lousie Sardais |publisher=BBC|access-date=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three mosques in Liverpool: the largest and main one, [[Al-Rahma mosque]], in the [[Toxteth]] area of the city and a mosque recently opened in the [[Mossley Hill]] district of the city. The third mosque was also recently opened in Toxteth and is on [[Granby Four Streets|Granby Street]].

===Demonymy and identity===
Natives of the city of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians, and colloquially as "Scousers", a reference to "[[scouse (food)|scouse]]", a form of stew.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Roberts, ''Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme'', Thorndike Press, 2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Scouse" has also become synonymous with the [[Scouse|Liverpool accent and dialect]]. Many people "self-identify" as Liverpudlians or Scousers without actually being born or living within the city boundaries of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Boland |first=Philip |title=Sonic Geography, Place and Race in the Formation of Local Identity: Liverpool and Scousers |date=2010 |journal=Geografiska Annaler.

In common with much of the rest of the UK today, Liverpool's economy is dominated by [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector industries]], both public and private.

Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of [[architectural style]]s found within the city, ranging from 16th century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor buildings]] to modern-day [[contemporary architecture]].&lt;ref name="Hughes (1999), p10"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Hughes (1999), p11"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over [[Listed buildings in Liverpool|2,500 listed buildings]] in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grade I listing for synagogue |publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2008 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2008/03/03/faith_synagogue_feature.shtml |access-date=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 85 are Grade II* listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Listed buildings |publisher=Liverpool City Council |url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Environment/Land_and_premises/Conservation/Listed_buildings/index.asp |access-date=21 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017074148/http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Environment/Land_and_premises/Conservation/Listed_buildings/index.asp |archive-date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Britain: Liverpool |publisher=HistoricBritain.com |url=http://www.historicbritain.com/results.aspx?showmessage=true&amp;location=liverpool&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |access-date=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more Georgian houses than the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Merseyside Facts |publisher=The Mersey Partnership |year=2009 |url=http://www.merseyside.org.uk/displaypage.asp?page=40 |access-date=13 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919203531/http://www.merseyside.org.uk/displaypage.asp?page=40 |archive-date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by [[English Heritage]], as England's finest Victorian city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heritage map for changing city |work=BBC News |date=19 March 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1881661.stm |access-date=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

===Waterfront and docks===
[[File:Albert Dock, Liverpool - DSC00940.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]] contains the UK's largest collection of Grade I listed buildings as well as being the most visited multi-use attraction outside London]]
As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed [[wet dock]] (the [[Old Dock]]) in 1715 and the first ever [[hydraulic]] lifting [[crane (machine)|cranes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jones |first=Ron |title=Albert Dock, Liverpool |publisher=R.J. Associates Ltd |year=2004 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known dock in Liverpool is the [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]], which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome&amp;nbsp;... and docks of Liverpool |work=Guardian Unlimited |date=7 March 2003 |author=Helen Carter |access-date=27 March 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built under the guidance of [[Jesse Hartley]], it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], [[International Slavery Museum]], [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[The Beatles Story]]. North of the city centre is [[Stanley Dock]], home to the [[Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse]], which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area&lt;ref name="Nicholls, p38"&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholls|2005|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html#sta |title=Trading Places: A History of Liverpool Docks (Stanley Dock) |website=Liverpool Museums |access-date=12 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028185038/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html |archive-date=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the [[Pier Head]], renowned for the trio of buildings – the [[Royal Liver Building]], the [[Cunard Building]] and the [[Port of Liverpool Building]] – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the ''Three Graces'', these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built-in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of Maritime Liverpool and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moscardini|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholls|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharples|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bluecoat Jan 6 2010 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bluecoat Chambers]], the oldest building in Liverpool city centre]]
In recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are the [[Museum of Liverpool]], the construction of the [[Liverpool Arena]] and BT Convention Centre on [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|Kings Dock]], [[Alexandra Tower, Liverpool|Alexandra Tower]] and [[1 Princes Dock]] on [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] and [[Liverpool Marina]] around [[Coburg Dock|Coburg]] and [[Brunswick Dock]]s.

However, plans to redevelop parts of the Liverpool have been marred by [[controversy]]. In December 2016, a newly formed company called [[North Point Global Ltd.]] was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the "New Chinatown" banner. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with glossy advertisements and videos, the "New Chinatown" development failed to materialise.&lt;ref name="at"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cook |first1=Richard |title=How Liverpool's 'New Chinatown' became black hole for Asian money |url=https://asiatimes.com/article/liverpools-new-chinatown-became-black-hole-asian-money/|access-date=16 March 2018 |publisher=Asia Times |date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the ''Liverpool Echo'' and ''Asia Times'' revealed that the site remained sans any construction, North Point Global as well as its subcontractor "Bilt" had both declared [[bankruptcy]], and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Houghton |first1=Alistair |title=New Chinatown site is a 'disgrace' with rats and litter say furious residents |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newsliverpool/new-chinatown-site-is-a-disgrace-with-rats-and-litter-say-furious-residents/ar-AAuXUiA|access-date=16 March 2018 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214124/https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newsliverpool/new-chinatown-site-is-a-disgrace-with-rats-and-litter-say-furious-residents/ar-AAuXUiA|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five similar development projects, mostly targeting individual Chinese and Hong Kong based citizens, were suspended due to financial misappropriations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Promises v reality: how the schemes were sold – and what they look like now |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/12/buyer-led-development-what-the-schemes-look-like-now|access-date=16 March 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial district and cultural quarter===
[[File:Victoria Street, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Victoria Street like many streets in the city centre is lined with dozens of listed buildings]]
Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.&lt;ref name="Liverpool City of Architecture"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[commercial district]] is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] layout. Having developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St George's Hall, Liverpool - geograph.org.uk - 500194.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]]]]
The oldest building in the area is the [[Grade I]] [[listed building|listed]] [[Liverpool Town Hall]], which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of [[Georgian architecture]], the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.&lt;ref name="Liverpool City Council (2005), p74"&gt;{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharples|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed [[Bank of England, Liverpool|Bank of England Building]], constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank.&lt;ref name="Liverpool City Council (2005), p74"/&gt; Amongst the other buildings in the area are the [[Tower Buildings, Liverpool|Tower Buildings]], [[Albion House, Liverpool|Albion House]] (the former [[White Star Line]] headquarters), the [[Municipal Buildings, Liverpool|Municipal Buildings]] and [[Oriel Chambers]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_pQPhVWNTY Manchester School of Architecture video] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered to be one of the earliest [[Modernist]] style buildings ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oriel Chambers |publisher=Liverpool Architectural Society |url=http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25 |access-date=14 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922062904/http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25 |archive-date=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Municipal Buildings, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|[[Municipal Buildings, Liverpool|Municipal Buildings]]]]
The area around [[William Brown Street]] is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the [[William Brown Library]], [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Picton Reading Room and Hornby Library|Picton Reading Rooms]] and [[World Museum Liverpool]]. The area is dominated by [[neo-classical architecture]], of which the most prominent, [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPHvynh3GQg&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=DC9B6CD6A63D327E&amp;index=30 Manchester School of Architecture video] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with "[[SPQR|S.P.Q.L.]]" (Latin ''senatus populusque Liverpudliensis''), meaning "the senate and people of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including [[Wellington's Column]] and the [[Steble Fountain]]. Many others are located around the area, particularly in [[St John's Gardens, Liverpool|St John's Gardens]], which was specifically developed for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the [[Roman Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tq3zz |title=People's Palaces: The Golden Age of Civic Architecture – BBC Four |website=BBC|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is [[Speke Hall]], a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]] located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is one of the few remaining [[timber framed]] Tudor houses left in the [[north of England]] and is particularly noted for its [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] interiors, which was added in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cousens |first=Belinda Cousins |title=Speke Hall |publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] |year=2006 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former [[manor house]]s including [[Croxteth Hall]] and [[Woolton Hall]], which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport in Liverpool is primarily centred on the city's road and rail networks, both of which are extensive and provide links across the United Kingdom. Liverpool has an extensive local public transport network, which is managed by [[Merseytravel]], and includes buses, trains and ferries. Additionally, the city also has an international airport and a major port, both of which provides links to locations outside the country.

===National and international travel===
====Road links====
As a major city, Liverpool has direct road links with many other areas within England. To the east, the [[M62 motorway]] connects Liverpool with [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] and along the route provides links to several large cities, including [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]]. The M62 also provides a connection to both the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and [[M1 motorway]]s, providing indirect links to more distant areas including [[Birmingham]], London, [[Nottingham]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Motorway Database M62 |publisher=cdrd.co.uk |url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/ |access-date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of the city, the [[Kingsway Tunnel|Kingsway]] and [[Queensway Tunnel]]s connect Liverpool with the [[Wirral Peninsula]], including [[Birkenhead]], and [[Wallasey]]. The [[A41 road]] and [[M53 motorway]], which both begin in Birkenhead, link to [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]] and via the [[A55 road|A55]], to [[North Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Motorway Database A55 |publisher=cdrd.co.uk |url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a55/ |access-date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south, Liverpool is connected to [[Widnes]] and [[Warrington]] via the [[A562 road|A562]] and across the [[River Mersey]] to [[Runcorn]], via the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge|Silver Jubilee]] and [[Mersey Gateway]] bridges.
[[File:Lime street july 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street Station]]]]

====Rail links====
Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by [[Merseyrail]] and provides links throughout Merseyside and beyond (see [[Liverpool#Local travel|Local travel]] below), while the national network, which is managed by [[Network Rail]], provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary mainline station is [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street station]], which is the terminus for several lines into the city, with numerous destinations, including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with [[British Rail Class 390|Pendolino]] trains), [[Birmingham]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Manchester, [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Leeds]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Sheffield]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Norwich]]. In the south of the city, [[Liverpool South Parkway]] provides a connection to the city's airport.

====Port====
The [[Port of Liverpool]] is one of Britain's largest ports, providing passenger ferry services across the [[Irish Sea]] to [[Belfast]], Dublin and the [[Isle of Man]]. Services are provided by several companies, including the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]], [[P&amp;O Ferries]] and [[Stena Line]]. In 2007, a new [[Liverpool Cruise Terminal|cruise terminal]] was opened in Liverpool, located alongside the [[Pier Head]] in the city centre.
November 2016 saw the official opening of [[Liverpool2]], an extension to the port that allows [[Post-Panamax#Post-Panamax ships|post-Panamax]] vessels to dock in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-37866804 |title=Liverpool's new £400m container terminal opens |work=BBC News |date=4 November 2016|access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] runs into Liverpool city centre via [[Liverpool Canal Link]] at Pier Head since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool Canal Link {{!}} Canal &amp; River Trust |url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/canal-and-river-network/liverpool-canal-link |website=canalrivertrust.org.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liverpool Cruise Terminal]] in the city centre provides long-distance passenger cruises, [[Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines]] [[MS Black Watch (1971)|MS Black Watch]] and [[Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages]] [[MS Magellan]] using the terminal to depart to [[Iceland]], [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Laura |title=Cruises you can get from Liverpool in 2019 |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/cruises-you-can-liverpool-2019-15640628 |work=liverpoolecho |date=7 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Airport====
[[File:John Lennon Airport Lpool.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] terminal building]]
[[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. In 2008, the airport handled over 5.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Airport Statistics: 2008 – annual |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=80&amp;pagetype=88&amp;sglid=3&amp;fld=2008Annual |access-date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today offers services to 68 destinations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airlines &amp; Tour Operators |publisher=[[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] |url=http://www.liverpoolairport.com/flight-information/airlines-and-tour-operators.html#airlines |access-date=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Barcelona and Zürich.

===Local travel===
====Trains====
[[File:Liverpool Central - Northern Line - Platforms 1 and 2 - 02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Merseyrail]] network has extensive underground sections within the city centre. [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] is the UK's busiest underground station outside London]]

Liverpool's [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom|local rail]] network is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network consists of three lines: the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]], which runs to [[Southport]], [[Ormskirk]], [[Kirkby]] and [[Hunts Cross]]; the [[Wirral Line]], which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], [[West Kirby]], [[Chester]] and [[Ellesmere Port]]; and the [[City Line (Merseyrail)|City Line]], which begins at [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street]], providing links to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Wigan]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Warrington]] and [[Manchester]].

The network is predominantly electric. Electrification of the City Line was completed in 2015. The two lines operated by Merseyrail are the busiest British urban commuter networks outside London, covering {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=off|round=5}} of track, with an average of 110,000 passenger journeys per weekday.&lt;ref name="Who are Merseyrail"&gt;{{cite web |title=Who are Merseyrail |publisher=[[Merseyrail]] |url=http://www.merseyrail.org/about/?sGUID=2a45e2d07d59c0d621570a918cb62195 |access-date=23 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626073949/http://www.merseyrail.org/about/?sGUID=2a45e2d07d59c0d621570a918cb62195 |archive-date=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Merseyrail reports record levels of performance |url=https://www.merseyrail.org/media/162040/Performance.pdf |website=Merseyrail |access-date=7 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172221/http://www.merseyrail.org/media/162040/Performance.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are operated by the [[Merseyrail]] franchise and managed by [[Merseytravel]]. Local services on the City Line are operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within the city centre the majority of the network is underground, with four city centre stations and over {{convert|6+1/2|mi|km|abbr=off|round=0.5}} of tunnels.&lt;ref name="Who are Merseyrail"/&gt;

===Literature===
[[Felicia Hemans]] (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Consulate general|consul]] in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and [[St. Asaph]] ([[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as "Land of my childhood, my home and my dead". Her first poems, dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who briefly corresponded with her.

A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Thomas De Quincey]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[Hugh Walpole]]. [[Daniel Defoe]], after visiting the city, described it, as "one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inspidered.wordpress.com/ |title=WordPress.com |publisher=Inspidered.wordpress.com |access-date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Melville]]'s novel [[Redburn]] deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections.&lt;ref name="inspidered.wordpress.com"/&gt; Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Philip James McFarland, ''Hawthorne in Concord''. (New York, NY : Grove Press, 2004), p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Dickens visited the city on numerous occasions to give public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesliverpoolandmore.com/liverpool-and-charles-dickens.html |title=Liverpool and Charles Dickens |publisher=BeatlesLiverpoolandMore |access-date=7 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123135001/http://www.beatlesliverpoolandmore.com/liverpool-and-charles-dickens.html |archive-date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openplaques.org/plaques/7935 |title=Gerard Manley Hopkins black plaque in Liverpool |publisher=Openplaques.org |access-date=7 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410122040/http://openplaques.org/plaques/7935 |archive-date=10 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, [[Jung]] famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp |title=''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (1961) |access-date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the poets who are connected with Liverpool, perhaps the greatest is [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], a twentieth-century Greek cultural icon, although he was born in Alexandria. From a wealthy family, his father had business interests in Egypt, London and Liverpool. After his father's death, Cavafy's mother brought him in 1872 at the age of nine to Liverpool, where he spent part of his childhood being educated. He lived first in Balmoral Road, then when the family firm crashed, he lived in poorer circumstances in Huskisson Street. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in Liverpool. In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the Long Depression of 1873, so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.&lt;ref name="inspidered.wordpress.com"/&gt;

''[[Her Benny]]'', a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher [[Silas K. Hocking]], was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluecoatpress.co.uk/liverpool/her-benny-silas-hocking/ ''Her Benny''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122053532/http://bluecoatpress.co.uk/liverpool/her-benny-silas-hocking/ |date=22 November 2012 }} Bluecoat Press&lt;/ref&gt; The prolific writer of adventure novels, [[Harold Edward Bindloss]] (1866–1945), was born in Liverpool.

In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the [[Unity Theatre, Liverpool|Unity Theatre]] in the 1930s as part of the [[Popular Front]] against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Garrett died in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Murphy, "Introduction" to ''The Collected George Garrett''. (Nottingham: Trent Editions, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist and playwright [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]] (1897–1985) was born in [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]], Liverpool, in 1897 (not [[Dublin]], nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family.&lt;ref&gt;An important biographical source is Chris Gostick's "Extra Material on James Hanley's ''[[Boy (novel)|Boy]]''", in the OneWorld Classics edition of ''Boy'' (2007), pp. 181–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen.

Liverpool has three universities: the [[University of Liverpool]], [[Liverpool John Moores University]] and [[Liverpool Hope University]]. [[Edge Hill University]], founded as a [[teacher-training college]] in the [[Edge Hill, Merseyside|Edge Hill]] district of Liverpool, is now located in [[Ormskirk]] in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]] (LIPA).

The [[University of Liverpool]] was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science.

[[File:Liverpool Community College Arts Centre - geograph.org.uk - 640908.jpg|thumb|[[Liverpool Community College]]'s Arts Centre]]

It is named in honour of [[John Moores (merchant)|Sir John Moores]], one of the founders of the [[Littlewoods Shop Direct Group|Littlewoods]] football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool [[Mechanics Institute]], opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university.

The city has one [[further education]] college, [[Liverpool Community College]] in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates [[Burton Manor]], a residential [[adult education]] college in nearby [[Burton, Ledsham and Willaston|Burton]], on the [[Wirral Peninsula]].

===Sports stadiums===
[[File:Panorama of Anfield with new main stand (29676137824).jpg|thumb|left|[[Anfield]], home of [[Liverpool F.C.]]]]
Liverpool is home to the [[Premier League]] football clubs [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]]
[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] has played at [[Anfield]] since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following [[Everton F.C.|Everton's]] departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star [[UEFA Elite Stadium]] with capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy.

After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to [[Goodison Park]] on the opposite side of [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. Goodison Park was the first major football stadium built in England. [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced grounds. Rangers opened [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in 1887, while [[Celtic Park]] was officially inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous transformation at Mere Green, spending up to £3000 on laying out the ground and erecting stands on three sides. For £552 Mr Barton prepared the land at 4½d a square yard. Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost of £1,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further £150, gates and sheds cost £132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another £7 15s to the bill.[[File:Goodisonview1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Goodison Park]], home of [[Everton F.C.]]]]

The ground was immediately renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But instead of a match, the 12,000 crowds saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second World War structures.

Everton is currently looking to relocate. The club have had previously raised the subject before in 1996, and in 2003 were forced to scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] due to financial reasons and also [[The Kirkby Project|Destination Kirkby]] to move just beyond Liverpool's council boundary in [[Kirkby]]. The latest plan is currently being drawn up to move to nearby [[Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium|Bramley-Moore Dock]] on Liverpool's waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Jamie |url=https://www.101greatgoals.com/news/everton-reveal-incredible-plans-for-new-stadium/ |title=Everton reveal incredible plans for new stadium |work=101 Great Goals |date=2 April 2018 |access-date=7 March 2019 |archive-date=25 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425135748/https://www.101greatgoals.com/news/everton-reveal-incredible-plans-for-new-stadium/ |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "I have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an African's blood." – [[George Frederick Cooke]] (1756–1812), an actor responding to being hissed at when he came onstage drunk during a visit to Liverpool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/liverpool/liverpool-cameo.html |title=Time Team &amp;#124; Archaeology &amp;#124; Channel 4 &amp;#124; Tony Robinson |publisher=Channel 4 |date=21 April 2008 |access-date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "That immense City which stands like another [[Venice]] upon the water&amp;nbsp;... where there are riches overflowing and every thing which can delight a man who wishes to see the prosperity of a great community and a great empire&amp;nbsp;... This quondam village, now fit to be the proud capital of any empire in the world, has started up like an enchanted palace even in the memory of living men." – [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]], 1791
* "I have heard of the greatness of Liverpool, but the reality far surpasses my expectation." – [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], speech, 1846
* "Liverpool&amp;nbsp;... has become a wonder of the world. It is the New York of Europe, a world city rather than merely British provincial." – ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 15 May 1886
* "The dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see the grayish-yellow raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everything was extremely unpleasant, black and opaque – just as I felt then. But I had a vision of unearthly beauty, and that is why I was able to live at all. Liverpool is the “pool of life.” The “liver,” according to an old view, is the seat of life, that which makes to live." – [[C. G. Jung]], ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', 1928
* "The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like a city in a rather gloomy Victorian novel&amp;nbsp;... We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once..." – [[J. B. Priestley]], ''English Journey'', 1934
* "If Liverpool can get into top gear again, there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing – it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas – [[Dublin]], or [[Boston]], or [[Hamburg]]. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the [[First World War]], were the abilities of the architects who built over it. The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of [[Liverpool Blitz|the bombings]] and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England." – [[Ian Nairn]], ''Britain's Changing Towns'', 1967
