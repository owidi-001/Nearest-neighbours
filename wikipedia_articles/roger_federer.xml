'''Roger Federer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər|lang}}; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional [[tennis]] player&lt;!-- Do not give mention to Federer being "one of the greatest tennis players of all time" in the lead without establishing consensus in the talk page. This goes the same for Djokovic and Nadal.  --&gt;. He is ranked No. 9 in the world by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP). He has won 20 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] men's singles titles, an all-time record shared with [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Novak Djokovic]]. Federer has been [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players#Weeks at No. 1|world No. 1]] in the ATP rankings a total of 310 weeks – including a record 237 consecutive weeks – and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Federer has won 103 ATP singles titles, the second-most of all-time behind [[Jimmy Connors]] and including a record six [[ATP Finals]].

Federer has played in an era where he dominated men's tennis together with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, who have been collectively referred to as the [[Big Three (tennis)|Big Three]] and are widely considered three of the greatest tennis players of all-time.{{efn|The group of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and [[Andy Murray]] has also been called the Big Four in reference to their place as the four best players of their era.}} A [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] junior champion in [[1998 Wimbledon Championships|1998]], Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon in [[2003 Wimbledon Championships|2003]] at age 21. In 2004, he won three out of the four major singles titles and the ATP Finals,{{efn|then known as the Tennis Masters Cup}} a feat he repeated in 2006 and 2007. From 2005 to 2010, Federer made 18 out of 19 major singles finals. During this span, he won his fifth consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. He completed the [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|career Grand Slam]] at the [[2009 French Open]] after three previous runner-ups to Nadal, his [[Federer–Nadal rivalry|main rival]] up until 2010. At age 27, he also surpassed [[Pete Sampras]]'s then-record of 14 Grand Slam men's singles titles at Wimbledon in [[2009 Wimbledon Championships|2009]].

Although Federer remained in the top 3 through most of the 2010s, the success of Djokovic and Nadal in particular ended his dominance over [[grass court|grass]] and [[hard court]]s. From mid-2010 through the end of 2016, he only won one major title. During this period, Federer and [[Stan Wawrinka]] led the [[Switzerland Davis Cup team]] to their first title in [[2014 Davis Cup|2014]], adding to the gold medal they won together in doubles at the [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]]. Federer also has a silver medal in singles from the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]], where he finished runner-up to [[Andy Murray]]. After taking half a year off in late 2016 to recover from knee surgery, Federer had a renaissance at the majors. He won three more Grand Slam singles titles over the next two years, including the [[2017 Australian Open]] over Nadal and a men's singles record eighth Wimbledon title later in [[2017 Wimbledon Championships|2017]]. He also became the oldest ATP world No. 1 in 2018 at age 36.

A versatile all-court player, Federer's perceived effortlessness has made him highly popular among tennis fans. Originally lacking self-control as a junior, Federer transformed his on-court demeanor to become well-liked for his general graciousness, winning the [[ATP World Tour Awards#Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award|Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award]] 13 times. He has also won the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]] award a record five times. Outside of competing, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the [[Laver Cup]] team competition. Federer is also an active philanthropist. He established the Roger Federer Foundation, which targets impoverished children in southern Africa, and has raised funds in part through the [[Match for Africa]] exhibition series. Federer is routinely one of the top ten highest-paid athletes in any sport, and ranked first among all athletes with $100 million in endorsement income in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Conner|first=Caira|title=Roger Federer on Retirement, Wimbledon, and Becoming Switzerland's New Tourism Ambassador|url=https://www.gq.com/story/roger-federer-retirement-wimbledon-switzerland|access-date=2021-05-25|website=GQ|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to [[conscription in Switzerland|compulsory military service]] in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was ruled "unsuitable" and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/roger-federer-exempte-pc-143403 |title=Roger Federer: le voici exempté de PC... |work=Le Matin |date=13 July 2009 |access-date=14 October 2009 |first=Fabian |last=Muhieddine |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018040912/http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/roger-federer-exempte-pc-143403 |archive-date=18 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he served in the civil protection force and was required to pay 3% of his taxable income as an alternative.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2004-02-06-federer-military_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Federer to serve in Swiss civil force, not army | access-date=25 March 2016 | date=6 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up supporting [[FC Basel]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/celebrityfans/228/article.aspx |title=Roger Federer – Celebrity fans – Interviews |work=FourFourTwo |date=31 July 2009 |access-date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer also credits his [[hand-eye coordination]] to the wide range of sports he played as a child, including [[badminton]] and [[basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/not-just-tennis/|title=How Badminton Helped Federer's Game|first=Thomas |last=Lin |publisher=Straight Sets|date=29 May 2009|access-date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer is married to former [[Women's Tennis Association]] player [[Mirka Federer|Miroslava Federer (née Vavrinec)]], whom he met while they were both competing for Switzerland at the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]].

Federer won three ATP Masters events, one was on clay in Hamburg, and the other two were on hard surfaces at Indian Wells and in Canada.&lt;ref name=RF2004/&gt; Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai and wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time.&lt;ref name=RF2004/&gt; He also won his first tournament on home soil by capturing the [[Swiss Open (tennis)|Swiss Open]] in Gstaad. His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74–6 was the best since [[Ivan Lendl]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hodgkinson|first=Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvZcDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=federer+2005+win+percentage&amp;pg=PA136|title=Fedegraphica: A Graphic Biography of the Genius of Roger Federer|date=24 May 2018|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=978-1-78131-838-6|location=London|pages=136|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the year-end No. 1 ranking for the first time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===2005: Consolidating dominance===
{{Main|2005 Roger Federer tennis season}}
In 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion [[Rafael Nadal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bierley|first=Stephen|date=3 June 2005|title=Tennis: Nadal beats Federer in battle of wills|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/04/tennis.frenchopen2005|access-date=7 June 2020|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance on grass, winning the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]] over [[Andy Roddick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=3 July 2005|title=Federer seals Wimbledon hat-trick|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4643611.stm|access-date=7 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Federer defeated [[Andre Agassi]] in the latter's last major final.&lt;ref name=RF2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2005&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer – 2005 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|access-date=8 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709073147/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2005&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|archive-date=9 July 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=York|first=Stephen Bierley in New|date=13 September 2005|title=Federer beats Agassi to claim US crown|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/sep/13/tennis.usopentennis2005|access-date=7 June 2020|website=The Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer also took four Masters wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal. Federer recovered from two sets and a break down to take the final in five sets. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; Federer lost the year-end championships to [[David Nalbandian]] in five sets while playing through a foot injury that sidelined him for almost the rest of the season after September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4336738.stm|title=Federer suffers ligament injury|date=13 October 2005|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained his position as No. 1 for the entire season.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt;

Federer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season. Federer's 81 match victories were the most since [[Pete Sampras]] in 1993, and his record of 81–4 (95.2%) remains the third-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind [[John McEnroe]]'s 1984 and [[Jimmy Connors]]'s 1974.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===2006: Career-best season===
{{Main|2006 Roger Federer tennis season}}
The 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for [[Tennis.com]], ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind [[Rod Laver]]'s Grand Slam year of 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Tignor|title=Final thoughts|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2011/11/final-thoughts/45347/|publisher=[[Tennis.com]]|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Amazing Roger Federer.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Federer hits a forehand at the 2006 US Open, where he became the first man in history to achieve the Wimbledon-US Open double for three consecutive seasons.]]
Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since Thomas Muster in 1995 and John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92–5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|last=VAVEL.com|date=28 December 2015|title=Greatest Seasons: Roger Federer 2006|url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/2015/12/28/583678-greatest-seasons-roger-federer-2006.html|access-date=7 June 2020|website=VAVEL|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the [[2006 French Open|French Open]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]] final. In the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Federer defeated [[Marcos Baghdatis]],&lt;ref name="RF2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer – 2006 Singles Playing Activity|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2006&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209225833/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2006&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|archive-date=9 February 2012|access-date=8 December 2014|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, Federer made it to six Masters finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bierley|first=Steve|date=24 May 2006|title=Tennis: Nadal blocks Federer's record hunting|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/may/25/tennis.frenchopen2006|access-date=7 June 2020|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1.&lt;ref name=RF2006/&gt; Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old [[Andy Murray]] in the second round of the [[2006 Cincinnati Masters]], in what was Federer's only defeat before reaching the final of a tournament that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=August 16, 2006: Murray snaps Federer's 55-match winning streak at..|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/ATP_Tennis/46423/august-16-2006-murray-snaps-federer-s-55match-winning-streak-at/|access-date=7 June 2020|website=Tennis World USA|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why Roger Federer's 2006 season beats Novak Djokovic's 2015 season|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/why-roger-federer-s-2006-season-beats-novak-djokovic-s-2015-season}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the season he won his hometown tournament, the [[Swiss Indoors]] in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runner up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Basel 2006: Roger Federer wins first title at home to start the supremacy|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Roger_Federer/62317/basel-2006-roger-federer-wins-first-title-at-home-to-start-the-supremacy/|access-date=7 June 2020|website=Tennis World USA|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007: Holding off young rivals===
{{Main|2007 Roger Federer tennis season}}
In 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] without dropping a set, beating [[Fernando González]] in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as [[Björn Borg]] at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus07/news/story?id=2744992|title=Federer defeats Gonzalez for 10th Grand Slam title|date=28 January 2007|publisher=ESPN|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record. Federer entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak ended in controversy. He was defeated by an Argentine, [[Guillermo Cañas]], who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bonnie |last=DeSimone|title=Canas keeps the ball in court in doping case|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2819004|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This surprising first-round defeat marked the first time since August 2006 he suffered defeat, a period spanning over seven months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=12 March 2007|title=Federer stunned by Canas on day of upsets|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-men-pacific-idUSL1002391020070312|access-date=7 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the clay season, Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set [[Bagel (tennis)|bagel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=20 May 2007|title=Federer ends Nadal's clay streak in Hamburg|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-men-masters-idUSL2034409220070520|access-date=7 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/scores/2007/520/MS001/match-stats|title=Rafael Nadal VS.

At [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a [[2007 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final|thrilling five-set encounter]] that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since [[1980 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final|1980]]. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with [[Björn Borg]] for the record of five consecutive championships at the [[All England Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=8 July 2007|title=Wimbledon: Roger Federer beats Rafael Nadal to win the men's singles final|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/08/tennis.wimbledon7|access-date=7 June 2020|website=The Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named [[Novak Djokovic]]. Djokovic proved his potential by beating the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final.

He finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |title=Australian Open Men's Singles Champions |publisher=Australian Open |access-date=15 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064147/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |archive-date=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |title=Roland Garros Men's Singles Past Winners 1891–2011 |publisher=Roland Garros |access-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071553/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |archive-date=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/rolls/menroll.html |title=Wimbledon Men's Singles Finals |publisher=Wimbledon |access-date=15 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412131416/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/rolls/menroll.html |archive-date=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |title=US Open Men's Singles Finals |publisher=US Open |access-date=15 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190523/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |archive-date=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third consecutive season that Federer held the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Allen|first=J.

He then participated in the [[2016 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] where he lost in the third round to [[Dominic Thiem]]. His withdrawal from the [[2016 French Open|French Open]] broke a record run of 65 consecutive participations in the main draw of Grand Slam tournaments, stretching back to the [[2000 Australian Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roger Federer: Former world number one withdraws from French Open|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/36336722|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=19 May 2016|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still suffering from recurring knee pain during the grass season he lost in the semifinals of Stuttgart and Halle.

===2021: Australian Open withdrawal, return to tour with mixed results and French Open retirement===
In January, Federer withdrew from the [[2021 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2021 Australian Open]] due to still recovering from his knee surgery and strict [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] quarantine measures in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roger Federer Withdraws From The Australian Open |url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-australian-open-2021-withdrawal |website=ATP Tour |publisher=ATP Tour |access-date=18 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roger Federer'S Australian Open Withdrawal due to Family not Injury - Tennis Australia Official |url=https://www.eurosport.co.uk/tennis/australian-open/2021/roger-federer-s-ausralian-open-withdrawal-due-to-family-not-injury-tennis-australia-official_sto8056351/story.shtml |website=Eurosport |publisher=Eurosport |access-date=18 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March, [[Novak Djokovic]] moved past him for the highest number of career weeks spent as the [[Open Era tennis records – men's singles#ATP Rankings achievements|ATP number 1 ranked player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Djokovic Sets New All-Time Record For Weeks At No. 1 In FedEx ATP Rankings |url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-311-weeks-no-1-fedex-atp-rankings |website=atptour.com |access-date=8 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March, he made his return to the [[2021 ATP Tour|ATP Tour]] at the [[2021 Qatar ExxonMobil Open – Singles|Qatar Open]]. He won his first ATP match in 14 months against [[Dan Evans (tennis)|Dan Evans]], but lost to [[Nikoloz Basilashvili]] in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/11/roger-federer-comeback-qatar-open-ended-nikoloz-basilashvili-tennis|title=Roger Federer's comeback at Qatar Open ended by Nikoloz Basilashvili|website=The Guardian|date=11 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer then played at the [[2021 Geneva Open – Singles|Geneva Open]] where he lost his second round match [[Pablo Andujar]] in three sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federer loses comeback match to Andujar at Geneva Open|url=https://sports.nbcsports.com/2021/05/19/federer-loses-comeback-match-to-andujar-at-geneva-open/|website=NBC Sports|access-date=9 June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating [[Dominik Koepfer]] of Germany in four sets in the third round, Federer advanced to the round of sixteen at the [[2021 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]].

In [[2021 Halle Open]] where he was seeded 5th, he lost in the second round to [[Félix Auger-Aliassime]]. Federer was playing against the 20-year-old for the first time. Their 19 years age difference was the biggest in Federer's 1,521 career matches. This was the earliest exit at this tournament for Federer who was seeking his 70th match win in Halle, and his 18th quarterfinal at this event in as many appearances.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-auger-aliassime-halle-2021-tuesday&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/On_the_ATP_results_with/99043/atp-halle-roger-federer-experiences-earliest-exit-to-felix-augeraliassime&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[2021 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]], 39 year-old Federer advanced to the quarterfinals and thus became the oldest Wimbledon quarterfinalist in the Open Era, breaking the record held by [[Ken Rosewall]],&lt;ref&gt;https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/07/05/roger-federer-oldest-wimbledon-quarterfinals/&lt;/ref&gt; following wins over [[Adrian Mannarino]] by retirement, [[Richard Gasquet]], 29th seed [[Cameron Norrie]], and 23rd seed [[Lorenzo Sonego]]. However, he was then upset by 14th seed [[Hubert Hurkacz]] in the quarterfinal in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 (4) 6-0. This was the first time in 19 years at Wimbledon he lost in straight sets, and only the second time he lost a set 6-0 in the 21st century (the previous occasion was against Nadal in the [[2008 French Open – Men's Singles|2008 French Open]] final).&lt;ref&gt;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10007216-roger-federer-upset-by-hubert-hurkacz-in-2021-wimbledon-quarterfinals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tennis.com/news/articles/wimbledon-quarterfinals-hubert-hurkacz-defeats-roger-federer-first-major-semi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/sports/tennis/federer-loses-at-wimbledon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==National representation==
===Olympic Games===
Federer made his [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] debut at [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's singles|Sydney]] in 2000, where he entered the singles competition. He surprised many by reaching the semifinals but lost to [[Tommy Haas]] in the semifinals and then to [[Arnaud Di Pasquale]] in the bronze medal match, causing Federer to leave Sydney empty handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=BBC World Service - Sportshour - Federer on his fading hopes of Olympic singles gold|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/kvZ2BNMlgnWvvt845sS53P/federer-on-his-fading-hopes-of-olympic-singles-gold|access-date=7 June 2020|website=BBC|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Summer Olympics 2000 Williams sisters win gold in women's doubles|url=https://www.espn.com/oly/summer00/news/2000/0927/784564.html|access-date=7 June 2020|website=www.espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], Federer was the clear favorite after claiming the world No. 1 ranking earlier in the year and capturing the [[Australian Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] titles. However, he lost in the second round to 18-year-old [[Tomáš Berdych]]. In doubles, he and compatriot [[Yves Allegro]] lost in the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=17 August 2004|title=Federer crashes out|language=en-GB|work=BBC sport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/tennis/3572960.stm|access-date=7 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012]], Federer won his first singles medal, losing to [[Andy Murray]] in the final to claim the silver.

===Davis Cup===
Federer made his [[Davis Cup]] for [[Switzerland Davis Cup team|Switzerland]] debut in the [[1999 Davis Cup World Group#Switzerland vs. Italy|World Group first round against Italy in 1999]] at 17 years of age. In his first match he defeated [[Davide Sanguinetti]] in four sets and recorded a second singles victory in a dead rubber two days later for Switzerland to advance to the World Group quarterfinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Roger Federer makes victorius Davis Cup debut at 17|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Roger_Federer/86195/roger-federer-makes-victorius-davis-cup-debut-at-17/|access-date=7 June 2020|website=Tennis World USA|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Federer suffered his first Davis Cup loss when he was defeated by Belgian [[Christophe Van Garsse]] in five sets. The Swiss team went on to lose the rubber 3–2. A year later, Federer competed in his first Davis Cup doubles rubber where he teamed with countryman [[Lorenzo Manta]] to defeat Australians [[Wayne Arthurs (tennis)|Wayne Arthurs]] and [[Sandon Stolle]] in four sets. Despite the doubles victory, Federer lost both singles rubbers to [[Mark Philippoussis]] and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] which saw Switzerland sent to the World Group Playoffs for the first time in Federer's career. He returned for the playoffs in July 2000 and led Switzerland to a 5–0 win over [[Belarus Davis Cup team|Belarus]] by recording wins in singles and doubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Davis Cup - Draws &amp; Results|url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie.aspx?id=M-DC-2000-WG-QR-SUI-BLR-01|access-date=7 June 2020|website=www.daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first Davis Cup highlight came in 2003 as the newly crowned Wimbledon champion led his country to an historic semifinal run. After recording five wins in ties against the [[Netherlands Davis Cup team|Netherlands]] and [[France Davis Cup team|France]], the Swiss team traveled to Melbourne to play the highly rated [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=6 April 2003|title=Davis Cup - World Group Quarterfinal results|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100004087|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321023954/http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=100004087|archive-date=21 March 2016|access-date=7 June 2020|website=daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer once again defeated Wimbledon runner-up [[Mark Philippoussis]] in the second rubber but dropped the doubles rubber in five sets.

He skipped many ties over the years but often competed in the World Group Playoffs in order for Switzerland to maintain their place in the top division.&lt;ref name="swiss-davis-cup"&gt;{{cite web |title=Switzerland Davis Cup Team |url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/teams/team.aspx?id=SUI |website=Davis Cup |access-date=8 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Davis Cup - Wawrinka to lead Swiss charge|url=https://www.daviscup.com/156479?channel=daviscupnews|access-date=7 June 2020|website=www.daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Federer to play Davis Cup tie against US {{!}} Tennis News|url=https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/federer-to-play-davis-cup-tie-against-us-1602709|access-date=7 June 2020|website=NDTVSports.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of countryman [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie that year. Their commitment paid off as wins over [[Serbia Davis Cup team|Serbia]], [[Kazakhstan Davis Cup team|Kazakhstan]] and [[Italy Davis Cup team|Italy]] allowed the Swiss team to advance to the [[2014 Davis Cup]] Final. Leading up to the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/20/roger-federer-davis-cup-final-switzerland-france-stan-wawrinka|title=Roger Federer's back problem leaves Davis Cup final on knife edge|first=Kevin|last=Mitchell|date=20 November 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and lost in straight sets to [[Gaël Monfils]]. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and [[Richard Gasquet]]. Federer defeated Gasquet in straight sets and in doing so won Switzerland its first (and only to date) Davis Cup title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=23 November 2014|title=Federer finishes the job to clinch Swiss Davis Cup triumph|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/davis-cup-2014-roger-federer-finishes-the-job-to-clinch-swiss-triumph-9878267.html|access-date=7 June 2020|website=The Independent|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Davis Cup - Federer hands Switzerland first Davis Cup title|url=https://www.daviscup.com/en/news/191522.aspx#:~:text=Roger%20Federer%20handed%20Switzerland%20a%20historic%20first%20Davis%20Cup%20title,Cup%20by%20BNP%20Paribas%20Final.|access-date=7 June 2020|website=www.daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopman Cup===
Federer won the [[Hopman Cup]] in [[2001 Hopman Cup|2001]] representing [[Switzerland at the Hopman Cup|Switzerland]], along with [[Martina Hingis]].

===Laver Cup===
Federer founded the [[Laver Cup]], which pits Europe against the rest of the world. The tournament is named in honor of [[Rod Laver]] and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Clarey|first=Christopher|date=20 September 2017|title=For Laver Cup, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal Are on the Same Side|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/sports/tennis/laver-cup-roger-federer-rafael-nadal.html|access-date=7 June 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe won the [[2017 Laver Cup|inaugural Laver Cup]] in 2017. Federer played his first singles match on day two, when he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, which took place at one set all. This was the first time Federer and Nadal competed on the same side of a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=24 September 2017|title=Laver Cup 2017: Team Europe beat Team World 15-9 in inaugural competition|language=en-gb|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/41381665|access-date=7 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Laver Cup 2017: Europe v The World - results &amp; standings|language=en-gb|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/41326484|access-date=7 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. They then met in the [[2009 Australian Open]] final, the [[2011 French Open]] final, and the [[2017 Australian Open]] final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals and the second Australian Open final.

===Federer vs. Djokovic===
{{Main|Djokovic–Federer rivalry}}
[[File:Rogers Cup 2010 Djokovic Federer007.jpg|thumb|250px|Federer and Djokovic at the [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Canadian Open]] in 2010.]]
Federer and [[Novak Djokovic]] have played 50 times, with Federer trailing 23–27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Novak Djokovic|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-novak-djokovic/F324/D643|publisher=ATP World Tour|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/Rivalries/Djokovic-Federer-Rivalry-New.aspx|title=Novak &amp; Roger: The Rivalry|publisher=ATP World Tour|access-date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are tied 4–4 on clay while Federer trails 18–20 on hard-courts and 1–3 on grass. The Federer–Djokovic rivalry is the largest rivalry in men's Grand Slam tournament history with a joint-record 17 matches played against each other (tied with [[Djokovic–Nadal rivalry|Djokovic–Nadal]]). Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open, also 2015 Wimbledon, US Open and 2016 Australian Open), and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer. Djokovic is one of two players (the other again being Nadal) on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Grand Slam event multiple times (2008 Australian Open, 2011 Australian Open, 2012 French Open, 2020 Australian Open), but Djokovic alone has done so four times.

Federer and Djokovic first played in a Grand Slam final at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]] where the three-time reigning champion and No. 1 Federer emerged victorious in straight sets. Federer ended Djokovic's perfect 41–0 start to the 2011 season in the semifinals of the French Open, but Djokovic was able to avenge this loss at the 2011 US Open in five sets after saving two match points against Federer for the second straight year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Djokovic Snatches Monumental Victory from Federer|work=Tennis Now|url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Djokovic-Snatches-Monumental-Victory-from-Federer.aspx|access-date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semifinals of Wimbledon 2012, Federer beat defending champion and No. 1 Djokovic in four sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon-2012/top-stories/Wimbledon-2012-Roger-Federer-keeps-his-dream-of-equalling-Sampras-record-alive/articleshow/14725127.cms|title=Wimbledon 2012: Roger Federer keeps his dream of equalling Sampras' record alive

This was the fifth consecutive time that Djokovic defeated Federer in Grand Slam matches. Some experts have included the rivalry between Federer and Djokovic as one of the best rivalries in the Open Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/824599-federer-vs-djokovic-the-best-hard-court-rivalry|title=Roger Federer vs. Novak Djokovic: The Best Hard Court Rivalry|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=28 August 2011|access-date=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federer vs. Murray===
Federer and [[Andy Murray]] have played 25 times, with Federer leading 14–11. Federer leads 12–10 on hard courts, and 2–1 on grass. They have never met on clay. After Federer won the first professional match they played, Murray dominated the first half of the rivalry, leading 8–5 in 2010, while the second half of the rivalry has been dominated by Federer, who leads 9–3 since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Andy Murray|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-andy-murray/F324/MC10|publisher=ATP World Tour|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two have met six times at the Grand Slam tournament level, with Federer leading 5–1.

However, Murray won their encounter in the semifinals of the [[2013 Australian Open]], defeating Federer for the first time at a Grand slam tournament in five sets. At the [[2014 Australian Open]], Federer reversed that result, defeating Murray in four sets in the quarterfinals. The most recent meeting between the two in a major was in the semifinals of the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships]], where a dominant Federer triumphed in straight sets.

They met in the final of the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]], in which Murray defeated Federer in straight sets, denying Federer a [[career Golden Slam]]. Murray also leads 6–3 in ATP 1000 tournaments, 2–0 in finals. They have also met five times at the [[ATP World Tour Finals|ATP Finals]], with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/14/tennis-murray-federer-masters-cup|title=Murray beats Federer in 3 sets|work=The Guardian|date=14 November 2008|access-date=27 April 2010|first=Steve|last=Bierley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Federer in London in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/9216649.stm|title=Roger Federer crushes lacklustre Andy Murray in London

===Federer vs. Roddick===
{{Main|Federer–Roddick rivalry}}
Federer and [[Andy Roddick]] played 24 times, and Federer leads their head-to-head 21–3. Roddick lost his No. 1 ranking to Federer after Federer won his first Australian Open in 2004. Their rivalry includes four Grand Slam event finals, three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open, all won by Federer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Andy Roddick|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-andy-roddick/F324/R485|publisher=ATP World Tour|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddick himself said it was not much of a rivalry, being so one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/173925.html|title=WTA big three one step away from a major rivalry|date=9 October 2012|publisher=ESPN|access-date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. The match included a 30-game fifth set (a Grand Slam final record) and lasted over four hours. In the final game of the deciding set, Roddick's serve was broken for the first time in the match. With that victory, Federer broke [[Pete Sampras]]' record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles, and Roddick apologised to Sampras (who was in attendance) for not being able to stop Federer.

===Federer vs. Hewitt===
Federer and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] played 27 times, with Federer leading 18–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Lleyton Hewitt|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-lleyton-hewitt/F324/H432|publisher=ATP World Tour|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. This marked a turning point in the rivalry, as Federer won 16 of the next 18 meetings from 2004 onwards. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel on both sides of a second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the [[2014 Brisbane International]], where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the [[2010 Gerry Weber Open|Halle]] title.

Hewitt and Federer teamed up in the men's doubles at Wimbledon in [[1999 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles|1999]]. They lost in the third round to [[Jonas Björkman]] and [[Pat Rafter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-28/federer-praises-hewitt-on-the-eve-of-his-final-wimbledon/6578372|title=Wimbledon: Lleyton Hewitt praised by Roger Federer ahead of SW19 finale|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 June 2015 |access-date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nalbandian dominated early on, winning their first five matches from 2002 to 2003. Federer reversed this trend at the [[2003 Tennis Masters Cup|2003 Masters Cup]], where he recorded his first victory, and went on to win 11 of their last 14 meetings. Federer leads 6–5 on hard courts, 1–0 on grass, and 3–1 on clay courts, while Nalbandian leads 2–1 on carpet. Notable meetings include Nalbandian's win in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the [[2005 Tennis Masters Cup|2005 Masters Cup]], and Federer's win in the [[2006 French Open]] semifinals. They met each other six times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 4–2.

Federer also defeated Safin in the finals of the [[2004 Australian Open]] to capture his first Australian Open and second Grand Slam tournament title. However, Safin defeated Federer in the [[2005 Australian Open]] semifinals, having saved one match point in the fourth-set tiebreak, to end a 26-match winning streak by Federer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/australianopen/2354682/New-rivalry-has-echoes-of-a-golden-era.html |title=New rivalry has echoes of a golden era|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 February 2005 |access-date=10 September 2012 |first=Mark |last=Hodgkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met each other five times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 4–1.

They first met in only the third tournament of Federer's career at the 1998 [[Swiss Indoors]] in Federer's hometown, with [[Andre Agassi]] prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Masters in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] that spanned over two days, with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the [[2005 Dubai Tennis Championships|2005 Dubai Championships]], Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two men play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel [[Burj al-Arab]]. Their final match was at one of the most prestigious platforms in the sport, when they played in the finals of the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|2005 US Open]]. Federer was victorious in four sets, claiming the 6th Grand Slam tournament of his career and denying Agassi his 9th.

===Federer vs. Wawrinka===
Federer and his fellow [[Switzerland|Swiss]] player [[Stan Wawrinka]] have played each other 26 times, with Federer leading 23–3. Federer leads 7–1 in Grand Slam tournaments, 17–0 on hard courts, 1–0 on grass courts and 5–3 on clay courts. The pair are 1–1 in finals.

Wawrinka defeated Federer in straight sets during the [[2015 French Open – Men's Singles|2015 French Open]] quarterfinals en route to winning his first French Open title, although Federer then won a straight-sets victory in the [[2015 US Open – Men's Singles|2015 US Open]] semifinals. Other close matches include the [[2012 Shanghai Rolex Masters – Singles|2012 Shanghai Masters]] and the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Singles|2013 Indian Wells Masters]], both of which Federer won in three sets, the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|2014 Wimbledon]] quarterfinal, which Federer won in four sets, the [[2014 ATP World Tour Finals – Singles|2014 ATP Finals]] semifinal, which Federer won in three sets after saving four match points, and the [[2017 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2017 Australian Open]] semifinal, which Federer won in five sets.

[[Juan Martín del Potro]] and Roger Federer have played 25 times, with Federer leading 18–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Juan Martin Del Potro|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-juan-martin-del-potro/F324/D683|publisher=ATP World Tour|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 5–2. Their two most famous Grand Slam tournament meetings came in 2009. The first was in the [[French Open]] semifinals, when Federer survived a five-set clash when he was on his way to the only French title of his career. The second was in the final of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where del Potro beat five-time defending champion Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's singles|2012 London Olympics]], where Federer prevailed 19–17 in the final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. They also met in the finals of the [[Swiss Indoors]] in 2012, 2013 and 2017, with del Potro prevailing on first two occasions, and Federer on last one of them in tight three-set matches.

In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again beat Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he beat Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down. In the final at the [[2018 BNP Paribas Open]] del Potro beat Federer in three close sets, after facing match points in the third set. With this win del Potro won his first Masters title of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Del Potro Saves 3 M.P. v.

Until 2020, no other male tennis player had won 20 major singles titles (the record has since been tied by Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic). Federer has also been in a record 31 major finals, including a record 10 in a row. He has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for the second-longest amount of time for a male player, behind [[Novak Djokovic]]. He was ranked No. 1 at the age of 36 and has won a record eight Wimbledon titles. He won five consecutive US Open titles, which is the most in the Open Era.

He has been voted by his peers to receive the tour [[ATP World Tour Awards#Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award|Sportsmanship Award]] a record thirteen times and voted by tennis fans to receive the [[ATP World Tour Awards#ATPTour.com Fans' Favourite|ATP Fans' Favorite]] award for seventeen consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/federer-atp-awards-2017|title=Federer Honoured With Three Awards|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer has been named the Swiss Sports Personality of the Year a record seven times. He has been named the ATP Player of the Year and ITF World Champion five times, and he has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record five times, including four consecutive awards from 2005 to 2008. He is also the only individual to have won the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year award four times.

Federer helped to lead a revival in tennis known by many as the [[Big Four (tennis)|Golden Age]]. This led to increased interest in the sport, which in turn led to higher revenues for many venues across tennis. During this period rising revenues led to exploding prize money; when Federer first won the [[Australian Open]] in 2004 he earned $985,000, compared to when he won in 2018 and the prize had increased to AUD 4{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/roger-federer/f324/overview|title=Roger Federer – Player Activity – ATP World Tour – Tennis|website=ATP World Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon winning the [[2009 French Open]] and completing the career Grand Slam, Federer became the first individual male tennis player to grace the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] since [[Andre Agassi]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c4/5d/49/c45d49278a524d6a107a00c354bb05c0.jpg|title=Sports Illustrated: Suddenly Andre|access-date=27 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first non-American player to appear on the cover of the magazine since [[Stefan Edberg]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="sicovers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicovers.com/SearchResults.aspx?pc=Tennis|title=Search Results|website=sicovers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer again made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' following his record-breaking [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|8th Wimbledon title]] and second Grand Slam of 2017, becoming the first male tennis player to be featured on the cover since himself in 2009.&lt;ref name="sicovers.com"/&gt;

==Playing style==
Federer's versatility has been described by [[Jimmy Connors]]: "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist... or you're Roger Federer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/2009/02/20/roger-federer-a-class-act-on-and-off-the-court-leads-tennis-revival/|title=Roger Federer, a class act on and off the court, leads tennis revival|author=sportsfeelgoodstories.com|date=20 February 2009|access-date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Federer Technique - Oz Open 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Federer serving at the [[Australian Open]] in 2014]]
An elite athlete, Federer is an [[Tennis strategy#All-court player|all-court, all-around player]] known for his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, being one of the best volleyers in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/696033/sizzling-on-court-humble-off-court/|title=Hall of Fame: Roger Federer – the Swiss Maestro|first=Aamna |last=Saiyid |work=The Express Tribune|access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a powerful, accurate [[smash (tennis)|smash]] and very effectively performs rare elements of professional tennis, such as the backhand smash and [[skyhook (tennis)|skyhook]], half-volley, jump smash (slam dunk) and an aggressive serve return known affectionately as SABR (Sneak Attack By Roger, a half-volley attack on an opponent's second serve). [[David Foster Wallace]] compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of "a great liquid whip",&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html|author=David Foster Wallace|title=Roger Federer as Religious Experience|date=20 August 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2 February 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John McEnroe]] has referred to Federer's forehand as "the greatest shot in our sport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/roger-or-rafa-clash-of-the-wimbledon-sex-symbols-860499.html|title=Roger or Rafa: Clash of the Wimbledon sex symbols|work=The Independent|date=5 July 2008|access-date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer is also known for his efficient, deceptively effortless movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand, usually considered his weaker wing, and instead hit a powerful and penetrating inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots. He also has great variety with his forehand, able to hit with topspin or pace (or both), thus opening up the court and going in to the forecourt for aggressive volleys.

Federer plays with a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the [[Backspin|slice]], occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire [[topspin]] winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; He has averaged 90% of service games won throughout his career, oftentimes coming up victorious in clutch or pressure service games. His [[serve (tennis)|serve]] is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve he is going to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200{{nbsp}}km/h (125{{nbsp}}mph);&lt;ref name=AUSServe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |title=Match Statistics: Federer vs. Murray |author=Australianopen.com |access-date=16 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225093113/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |archive-date=25 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIMBYServe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|title=Match Statistics:Federer vs. Roddick|author=Wimbledon.org|access-date=16 February 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612031302/http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|archive-date=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&amp;id=3471097|title=Federer's serve allowing him to manufacture easy points|first=Ravi |last=Ubha |publisher=ESPN|date=2 July 2008|access-date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he is capable of serving at 220{{nbsp}}km/h (137{{nbsp}}mph).&lt;ref name=AUSServe/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIMBYServe/&gt; Federer is also accomplished at [[serve and volley]]ing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/08/tennis.wimbledon2003|first=Stephen |last=Bierley |title=Serve-volley dead?

Later in his career, Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He sometimes uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially referred to as a "[[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]]" or "hotdog". His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] against [[Novak Djokovic]], bringing him triple match point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|title=The Tale of Two Tweeners: Federer vs. Llodra|first=Nima |last=Naderi |publisher=bleacherreport.com|date=30 September 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207163358/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|archive-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer is one of the top players who employ successfully the "squash shot", when he gets pushed deep and wide on his forehand wing. Since [[Stefan Edberg]] joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season, Federer has played a more offensive game, attacking the net more often, and improved his volley shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Tignor|title=No. 8: The Roger Resurgence|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/12/roger-resurgence/53370/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Bodo|title=The Reliables|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/08/reliables/52464|publisher=Tennis.com|date=17 August 2014|author-link1=Peter Bodo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the 2015 US Open, Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger), in which he charges forward to receive the second serve and hits a return on the service line. The SABR is a unique shot that Federer owns, in the way that he manages to add enough power and placement into the shot, which makes it very difficult, or close to impossible for the opponent to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2015-09-03/the_sabr_federers_new_bravado.html?chip=2|title=The SABR: Federer's new bravado|website=USOpen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the switch to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with fewer shanks. However this has diminished control and power on his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kamashi |last=Tandon|title=Roger Federer Credits Switch To Bigger Racquet For Improved Backhand|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/03/roger-federer-racquet-change-backhand-rafael-nadal-indian-wells/64840/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=16 March 2017|access-date=25 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his comeback in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited as the reason for his win against Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th round.

Federer is also noted for his cool demeanour and emotional control on the court. In contrast to his early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him an advantage over less controlled opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/addiction-in-society/201509/why-roger-federer-is-great|title=Why Roger Federer is Great|first=Stanton |last=Peele |publisher=psychologytoday.com|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/sports/tennis/10federer.html|title=Cool Federer Image Was Forged in a Hot Head|first=David |last=Waldstein |work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Roger_Federer/78128/roger-federer-i-do-not-know-if-i-will-be-playing-in-three-or-five-years-/|title=Roger Federer: 'I do not know if I will be playing in three or five years'|website=Tennis World USA|language=en-US|access-date=9 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer declared: {{bquote|I don't get the anxiety during a match so much anymore.
