'''Greece''' ({{lang-el|Ελλάδα}}, {{Lang|el-Latn|Elláda}}, {{IPA-el|eˈlaða|}}), officially the '''Hellenic Republic''',{{efn| {{Lang-el|Ελληνική Δημοκρατία|translit=Elliniki Dimokratia|links=no}}, {{IPA-el|eliniˈci ðimokraˈti.a|}}}} is a country located in [[Southeast Europe]]. Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018; [[Athens]] is its largest and capital city, followed by [[Thessaloniki]]. Situated on the southern tip of the [[Balkans]], Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It shares land borders with [[Albania]] to the northwest, [[North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the northeast. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of the [[Geography of Greece|mainland]], the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, the [[Sea of Crete|Cretan Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[List of countries by length of coastline|11th longest coastline in the world]] at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring many [[List of islands of Greece|islands]], of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with [[Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak at {{convert|2918|m|ft}}. The country consists of nine [[Geographic regions of Greece|traditional geographic regions]]: [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Central Greece]], the [[Peloponnese]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], the [[Aegean Islands]] (including the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Cyclades]]), [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian Islands]].

Greece is considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilization]], being the birthplace of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], [[Western philosophy]], [[Western literature]], [[historiography]], [[political science]], major [[History of science in classical antiquity|scientific]] and [[Greek mathematics|mathematical]] principles, [[History of theatre|theatre]] and the [[Olympic Games]]. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as ''poleis'' (singular ''[[polis]]''), which spanned the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Black Sea]]. [[Philip II of Macedon]] united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son [[Alexander the Great]] rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. The subsequent [[Hellenistic period]] saw the height of [[Greek culture]] and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the [[Byzantine Empire]], which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The [[Greek Orthodox Church]], which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox world]]. After falling under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern [[nation state]] in 1830 following a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]]. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

Greece is a [[unitary parliamentary republic]], and a [[developed country]], with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]], and a high [[quality of life]], ranking simultaneously very high in the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]]. Its economy is the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest]] in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. A founding member of the [[United Nations]], Greece was the tenth member to join the [[European Communities]] (precursor to the [[European Union]]) and has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the [[Council of Europe]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF). Greece's unique cultural heritage, large [[Tourism in Greece|tourism industry]], [[Greek shipping|prominent shipping sector]] and geostrategic importance classify it as a [[middle power]].{{efn|See:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Strategic Importance of Greece |date=5 April 2016 |url=https://geopoliticalfutures.com/the-strategic-importance-of-greece/ |publisher=geopoliticalfutures.com |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Geopolitics of Greece: "One cannot afford anymore to manage the Greek crisis without due consideration of its geopolitical consequences" |url=http://janelanaweb.com/crise/the-geopolitics-of-greece-one-cannot-afford-anymore-to-manage-the-greek-crisis-without-due-consideration-of-its-geopolitical-consequences-thanos-dokos-eliamep/ |publisher=janelanaweb.com |access-date=6 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307045600/http://janelanaweb.com/crise/the-geopolitics-of-greece-one-cannot-afford-anymore-to-manage-the-greek-crisis-without-due-consideration-of-its-geopolitical-consequences-thanos-dokos-eliamep/ |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Geostrategic Value of Greece and Sweden in the Current Struggle between Russia and NATO |date=19 December 2015 |url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-geostrategic-value-of-greece-and-sweden-in-the-current-struggle-between-russia-and-nato |publisher=atlanticcouncil.org |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=The Geopolitical Importance of Greece through the Ages |url=https://www.academia.edu/11230737 |publisher=academia.edu |access-date=6 March 2017|last1=Kitsikis |first1=Dimitri }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Greece in the Geostrategic Chessboard of Natural Gas |url=http://www.naturalgasworld.com/greece-geostrategic-significance-natural-gas |publisher=naturalgasworld.com |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geopolitical Consequences Of 'Grexit' Would Be Huge |url=http://www.bmiresearch.com/blog/geopolitical-consequences-of-grexit-would-be-huge |publisher=bmiresearch.com |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greece can still be a geopolitical asset for the EU |url=http://europesworld.org/2013/06/01/greece-can-still-be-a-geopolitical-asset-for-the-eu/ |publisher=europesworld.org |access-date=6 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111051954/http://europesworld.org/2013/06/01/greece-can-still-be-a-geopolitical-asset-for-the-eu/ |archive-date=11 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece and NATO: a long lasting relationship |url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2012/turkey-greece/greece-nato-partnership/en/index.htm |publisher=nato.int |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Name ==
{{Main|Name of Greece}}
The native name of the country in Modern Greek is {{lang|el|Ελλάδα}} (''{{transl|el|ISO|{{Audio|Ellada.ogg|Elláda|help=no}}}}'', pronounced {{IPA-el|eˈlaða|}}). The corresponding form in Ancient Greek and conservative formal Modern Greek ([[Katharevousa]]) is {{lang|el|Ἑλλάς}} ({{Lang|grc-Latn|Hellas}}, classical: {{IPA-grc|hel.lás|}}, modern: {{IPA-el|eˈlas|}}). This is the source of the English alternate name ''Hellas'', which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today. The Greek adjectival form {{lang|el|ελληνικός}} ({{Lang|el-Latn|ellinikos}}, {{IPA-el|eliniˈkos|}}) is sometimes also translated as ''Hellenic'' and is often rendered in this way in the formal names of Greek institutions, as in the official name of the Greek state, the ''Hellenic Republic'' ({{lang|el|Ελληνική Δημοκρατία}}, {{IPA-el|eliniˈci ðimokraˈti.a|}}).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Government and Politics|url=https://www.mfa.gr/usa/en/about-greece/government-and-politics/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227041444/https://www.mfa.gr/usa/en/about-greece/government-and-politics/|archive-date=27 December 2019|access-date=28 April 2020|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English names ''Greece'' and ''Greek'' are derived, via the Latin ''{{lang|la|Graecia}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Graecus}}'', from the name of the [[Graecians|Graeci]] ({{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}, {{Lang|grc-Latn|Graikoí}}; &lt;small&gt;singular&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|Γραικός}}, {{Lang|grc-Latn|Graikós}}), who were among the first [[List of ancient Greek tribes|ancient Greek tribes]] to settle [[Magna Graecia]] in [[southern Italy]]. The term is ultimately derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵerh₂-|{{PIE|*ǵerh₂-}}]]'', "to grow old".

The Roman Empire in the east, following the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Empire in the west]] in the 5th century, is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire (but was simply called "Kingdom of the Romans" in its own time) and lasted until 1453.

From the 4th century, the Empire's Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The raids and devastation of the [[Goths]] and [[Huns]] in the 4th and 5th centuries and the [[South Slavs|Slavic]] invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–6}} Following the Slavic invasion, the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the densely populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica, while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognise imperial authority.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–6}} Outside of these areas, a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred, although on a much smaller scale than previously thought.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 63–6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = TE | last = Gregory | title = A History of Byzantium | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2010 | page = 169 | quote = It is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the Balkans after the Slavic "invasions" were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier, although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbors, including the Byzantines.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the view that Greece in late antiquity underwent a crisis of decline, fragmentation and depopulation is now considered outdated, as Greek cities show a high degree of institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries AD (and possibly later as well). In the early 6th century, Greece had approximately 80 cities according to the [[Synecdemus]] chronicle, and the period from the 4th to the 7th century AD is considered one of high prosperity not just in Greece but in the entire Eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Rothaus2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard M.

Until the 8th century almost all of modern Greece was under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See]] of [[Rome]] according to the system of [[Pentarchy]].

While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century, [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]] remained [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively. The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the [[Ionian Islands]], which remained Venetian until their capture by the [[First French Republic]] in 1797, then passed to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992| page=10}}

While some Greeks in the Ionian Islands and [[Constantinople]] lived in prosperity, and Greeks of Constantinople ([[Phanariotes]]) achieved positions of power within the Ottoman administration,{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992|page 23}} much of the population of mainland Greece suffered the economic consequences of the Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into [[serfdom|serfs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kourvetaris | first1 = George | last2 = Dobratz | first2 = Betty | title = A profile of modern Greece: in search of identity | page = 33 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ePwcAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Greece+chiflik+serfs | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1987| isbn = 9780198275510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to [[Islam]], Christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the Ottoman Empire. Discrimination against Christians, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many "crypto-Christians" returned to their old religious allegiance.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992|page=14}}

[[File:White Tower and Beach front.jpg|thumb|right|The [[White Tower of Thessaloniki]], one of the best-known Ottoman structures remaining in Greece.]]

The nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992|page=14}} Some cities had governors appointed by the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]], while others (like Athens) were self-governed municipalities. Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for many centuries.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}}

When military conflicts broke out between the Ottoman Empire and other states, Greeks usually took up arms against the Ottomans, with few exceptions.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Prior to the Greek Revolution of 1821, there had been a number of wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans, such as the Greek participation in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the Epirus peasants' revolts of 1600–1601 (led by the Orthodox bishop [[Dionysios Skylosophos]]), the [[Morean War]] of 1684–1699, and the [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-instigated [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770, which aimed at breaking up the Ottoman Empire in favour of Russian interests.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = March 2013}} These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Lyn | last = Harrington | title = Greece and the Greeks | page = 124 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d7BAAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=greece+revolts+ottoman+rule+bloodshed | publisher = T Nelson | year = 1968}}, 221 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Jamie | last1 = Stokes | first2 = Anthony | last2 = Gorman | title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East | page = 256 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;q=greece%20ottoman%20rule%20revolts%20orlov&amp;pg=PA256 | publisher = Infobase | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4381-2676-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, many Greeks were conscripted as Ottoman citizens to serve in the Ottoman army (and especially the Ottoman navy), while also the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], responsible for the Orthodox, remained in general loyal to the empire.

The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a "dark age" in Greek history, with the prospect of overthrowing Ottoman rule appearing remote with only the Ionian islands remaining free of Turkish domination. [[Corfu]] withstood three major sieges in [[Siege of Corfu (1537)|1537]], 1571 and [[Siege of Corfu (1716)#The Siege of Corfu|1716]] all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans. However, in the 18th century, due to their mastery of shipping and commerce, a wealthy and dispersed Greek merchant class arose. These merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, establishing communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Western Europe. Though the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from significant European intellectual movements such as the [[Reformation]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], these ideas together with the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] and [[romantic nationalism]] began to penetrate the Greek world via the mercantile diaspora.{{Sfn | Clogg | 1992|page=27}} In the late 18th century, [[Rigas Feraios]], the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state, published a series of documents relating to Greek independence, including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece, in [[Vienna]].

In the late eighteenth century, an increase in secular learning during the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]] led to the revival among Greeks of the diaspora of the [[Greek nationalism|notion of a Greek nation]] tracing its existence to [[ancient Greece]], distinct from the other Orthodox peoples, and having a right to political autonomy. One of the organizations formed in this intellectual milieu was the [[Filiki Eteria]], a secret organization formed by merchants in [[Odessa]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|2009|pp=81–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriating a long-standing tradition of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the [[eastern Roman empire]] and creating the impression they had the backing of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], they managed amidst a crisis of Ottoman trade, from 1815 onwards, to engage traditional strata of the Greek Orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatzopoulos|2009}}. For the crisis of maritime trade from 1815 onwards, see {{harvnb|Kremmydas|1977}} and {{harvnb|Kremmydas|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]] and [[Constantinople]]. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexandros Ypsilantis]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north spurred the Greeks of the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821 the [[Maniots]] declared war on the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Brewer, D. 2001, pp. 235"&gt;Brewer, D.

By the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] had captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Central Greece]], which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, including [[Chios Massacre|Chios]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]], committing wholesale [[Massacres during the Greek Revolution|massacres]] of the population.&lt;ref name="Brewer, D. 2001, pp. 235" /&gt; Approximately three-quarters of the [[Chios]]' Greek population of 120,000 were [[Chios massacre|killed, enslaved]] or died of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Spencer C. |title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East |date=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781851096725 | page=1140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&amp;pg=PA1140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-11-28/features/016.html|title=The Chios Massacre Of 1822|work=Queens Gazette|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111173817/http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-11-28/features/016.html|archive-date=11 November 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western Europe in favour of the Greek rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klose|first1=Fabian|title=The Emergence of Humanitarian Intervention: Ideas and Practice...|date=2016|publisher=Clays|isbn=9781107075511|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMvZCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=castlereagh+chios&amp;pg=PA175|access-date=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Willert|first=Trine Stauning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB1tDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=The+New+Ottoman+Greece+in+History+and+Fiction|title=The New Ottoman Greece in History and Fiction|date=4 September 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-93849-3|pages=71–100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of [[Missolonghi]]—put under siege by the Turks since April 1825—fell in April 1826. Although Ibrahim was defeated in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese, and Athens had been retaken.

After years of negotiation, three [[great powers]], [[Bourbon Restoration in France|France]], [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom]], decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. A week-long standoff ended with the [[Battle of Navarino]] (20 October 1827) which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. A [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]] was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the [[First Hellenic Republic|nascent Greek state]] was finally recognised under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] in 1830.

In 1827, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], from [[Corfu]], was chosen by the [[Third National Assembly at Troezen]] as the first governor of the [[First Hellenic Republic]]. Kapodistrias established a series of state, economic and military institutions. Soon tensions appeared between him and local interests. Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent [[London Conference of 1832|London conference]] a year later, the [[Great Power]]s of Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]] as [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|monarch]].&lt;ref name="britannica otto"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Otto |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Otto-king-of-Greece |language=en |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto's reign was [[despotism|despotic]], and in its first 11 years of independence Greece was ruled by a Bavarian oligarchy led by [[Joseph Ludwig von Armansperg]] as [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] and, later, by Otto himself, who held the title of both King and Premier.&lt;ref name="britannica otto" /&gt; Throughout this period Greece remained under the influence of its three protecting [[great power|Great Powers]], [[July Monarchy|France]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and the [[United Kingdom]], as well as [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXfatJ1aQq0C&amp;q=king%2520otto%2520german%2520language%2520administration%2520greece&amp;pg=PA71 |title=The Theory and Practice of Institutional Transplantation: Experiences with the Transfer of Policy Institutions |last1=Jong |first1=M. de |last2=Lalenis |first2=K. |last3=Mamadouh |first3=V.

Otto was deposed in the [[23 October 1862 Revolution]]. Multiple causes led to his deposition and exile, including the Bavarian-dominated government, heavy taxation, and a failed attempt to annex [[Crete]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="britannica otto" /&gt; The catalyst for the revolt was Otto's dismissal of [[Konstantinos Kanaris]] from the Premiership.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia imperialism" /&gt; A year later, he was replaced by Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name [[George I of Greece|George I]] and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain.

[[File:Map Greece expansion 1832-1947-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The territorial evolution of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] from 1832 to 1947.]]

Corruption, coupled with Trikoupis' increased spending to fund infrastructure projects like the [[Corinth Canal]], overtaxed the weak Greek economy and forced the declaration of [[Sovereign default|public insolvency]] in 1893. Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called [[Modern Greek|Demotic]]. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of [[Ancient Greek]].

Government documents and newspapers were consequently published in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the [[New Testament]] was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the ''Evangeliaka''). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.

All Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the [[regions of ancient Greece|Hellenic lands]] under Ottoman rule. Especially in [[Crete]], a [[Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)|prolonged revolt in 1866–1869]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, [[Thessaly]] and small parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] were ceded to Greece as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.

Greeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]]. With state coffers empty, fiscal policy came under [[International Financial Control]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Alarmed by the abortive [[Ilinden uprising]] of the [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) in 1903, the Greek government, aiming to quell [[Komitadjis]] (IMRO bands) and detach the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavophone peasants of the region]] from [[Bulgarian Macedonians|Bulgarian]] influence, sponsored a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign in Ottoman-ruled [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], led by Greek officers and known as the [[Macedonian Struggle]], which ended with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livanios|1999|pp=195–6}}, {{harvnb|Koliopoulos|Veremis|2002|pp=280–1}}, {{harvnb|Kostopoulos|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst general dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of [[Megali Idea|national aspirations]] under the premiership of the cautious reformist [[Georgios Theotokis|Theotokis]], a group of military officers organised a [[Goudi coup|coup]] in August 1909 and shortly thereafter called to Athens [[Cretan State|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who conveyed a vision of national regeneration. After winning [[Greek legislative election, August 1910|two]] [[Greek legislative election, November 1910|elections]] and becoming Prime Minister in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazower|1992|pp=886, 890–3, 895–900, 904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal, social, and [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitutional reforms]], reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the [[Balkan League]], and led the country through the [[Balkan Wars]]. By 1913, Greece's territory and population had almost doubled, annexing [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. In the following years, the struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Venizelos over the country's foreign policy on the eve of [[First World War]] dominated the country's political scene and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]]. During parts of WW1, Greece had two governments: A royalist [[Central Powers|pro-German]] one in [[Athens]] and a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] one in [[Thessaloniki]]. The two governments were united in 1917, when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Entente.

In the aftermath of World War I, Greece attempted further expansion into [[Asia Minor]], a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]], contributing to a massive flight of [[Ottoman Greeks|Asia Minor Greeks]].&lt;ref name=Gibney&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew J.

The following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5 million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey had to be integrated into Greek society. [[Cappadocian Greeks]], [[Pontian Greeks]], and [[Antiochian Greeks|non-Greek followers of Greek Orthodoxy]] were all subject to the exchange as well. Some of the refugees could not speak the language and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland Greeks, such as in the case of the Cappadocians and non-Greeks. The refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost, as the number of refugees was more than a quarter of Greece's prior population.&lt;ref&gt;Howland, Charles P.

Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished [[Greek republic referendum, 1924|via a referendum]] in 1924 and the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] was declared. In 1935, a royalist general-turned-politician [[Georgios Kondylis]] took power after a [[coup d'état]] and abolished the republic, holding [[Greek monarchy referendum, 1935|a rigged referendum]], after which [[George II of Greece|King George II]] returned to Greece and was restored to the throne.

An agreement between Prime Minister [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and the head of state [[George II of Greece|George II]] followed in 1936, which installed Metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the [[4th of August Regime]], inaugurating a period of authoritarian rule that would last, with short breaks, until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagen|first=Fleischer|title=Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes in Europe: Legacies and Lessons from the Twentieth Century|chapter=Authoritarian Rule in Greece (1936–1974) and Its Heritage|year=2006|location=New York/Oxford|publisher=Berghahn|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a dictatorship, Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the [[Axis powers|Axis]].

On 28 October 1940, [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] demanded the surrender of Greece, but the Greek administration refused, and, in the following [[Greco-Italian War]], Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania, giving the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] their first victory over Axis forces on land.

The Nazis proceeded to administer Athens and Thessaloniki, while other regions of the country were given to Nazi Germany's partners, Fascist Italy and Bulgaria. The occupation brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population. Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–1942, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Greece|collaborators]], the country's economy was ruined, and the great majority of [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]] (tens of thousands) were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244154/Greece/26430/Greek-history-since-World-War-IGreece | title = Greek history since World War I | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazower 2001, p. 155"&gt;Mazower (2001), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek Resistance]], one of the most effective resistance movements in Europe, fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators.

The country almost immediately descended into [[Greek Civil War|a bloody civil war]] between [[Communism|communist]] forces and the anti-communist Greek government, which lasted until 1949 with the latter's victory. The conflict, considered one of the earliest struggles of the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref name= Noam&amp;Chomsky&gt;{{cite book|last= Chomsky|first= Noam|title= ''World Orders, Old And New''|publisher= Pluto Press London|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in further economic devastation, mass population displacement and severe political polarisation for the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Mazower|Mazower, Mark]]. ''After the War was Over''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the post-war decades were characterised by social strife and widespread marginalisation of the left in political and social spheres, Greece nonetheless experienced [[Greek economic miracle|rapid economic growth]] and recovery, propelled in part by the U.S.-administered [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Global Economy.

====Military regime (1967–74)====
King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]]'s [[Apostasia of 1965|dismissal]] of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]]'s centrist government in July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence, which culminated in a coup d'état on 21 April 1967 by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Regime of the Colonels]]. Under the junta, civil rights were suspended, political repression was intensified, and human rights abuses, including state-sanctioned torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on 17 November 1973 set in motion the events that caused the fall of the Papadopoulos regime, resulting in a counter-coup which overthrew [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] and established brigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as the new junta strongman. On 20 July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus]] in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup, triggering a political crisis in Greece that led to the regime's collapse and the restoration of democracy through [[Metapolitefsi]].

==== Third Hellenic Republic ====

[[File:Accession of Greece to the European Union.png|thumb|Signing at [[Zappeion]] by [[Constantine Karamanlis]] of the documents for the accession of Greece to the [[European Union|European Communities]] in 1979.]]

The former prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the [[Metapolitefsi]] era. The [[Greek legislative election, 1974|first multiparty elections]] since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which chose to not restore the monarchy.

Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]], George Papandreou's son, founded the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations dominating in government over the next four decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | name="integrated1974" | On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of [[NATO]] in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus; Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.}}&lt;ref name="AdamHartDavis"&gt;History, Editorial Consultant: Adam Hart-Davis.

Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. Traditionally strained [[Greek–Turkish relations|relations with neighbouring Turkey]] [[Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy|improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999]], leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's bid]] for EU membership.

Left-wing [[Syriza]], led by Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]], governed Greece since 2015 until 2019. Syriza gained support by opposing the austerity policy that had affected Greeks since the beginning of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. However, prime minister Tsipras was succeeded by [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] after the landslide victory of centre-right New Democracy in the 2019 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2019-07-08|title=Greece elections: Centre-right regains power under Kyriakos Mitsotakis|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48902766|access-date=2021-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe. [[Mount Olympus]], the mythical abode of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Gods]], culminates at Mytikas peak {{convert|2918|m|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/infos.asp |title=Olympus the First National Park |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2008 |publisher=Management Agency of Olympus National Park |access-date=5 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114094456/http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/Infos.asp |archive-date=14 January 2017 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest in the country. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the [[Pindus]] mountain range. The Pindus, a continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]], reaches a maximum elevation of {{convert|2637|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Smolikas|Mt. Smolikas]] (the second-highest in Greece) and historically has been a significant barrier to east–west travel.

The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese, crosses the islands of [[Kythera]] and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterised by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. The spectacular [[Vikos Gorge]], part of the [[Vikos-Aoos National Park]] in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2005: Special 50th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records | year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4wYAAAAIAAJ | isbn= 978-1-892051-22-6| page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable formation are the [[Meteora]] rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.

Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] range, spreading across the region of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests, including the famous [[Dadia Forest]] in the [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros regional unit]], in the far northeast of the country.

Extensive plains are primarily located in the regions of [[Thessaly]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country. Rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the [[loggerhead sea turtle]] live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered [[brown bear]], the [[Eurasian lynx]], the [[roe deer]] and the wild goat.

Crete is the largest and most populous island; [[Euboea]], separated from the mainland by the 60&amp;nbsp;m-wide [[Euripus Strait]], is the second largest, followed by [[Lesbos]] and [[Rhodes]].

The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] in the Saronic gulf near Athens, the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea, the [[North Aegean islands]], a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey, the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey, the [[Sporades]], a small tight group off the coast of northeast Euboea, and the Ionian Islands, located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.

{{Further|Climate of Greece}}

The [[climate of Greece]] is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Climate of Greece |url=http://www.hnms.gr/emy/en/climatology/climatology |website=Hellenic National Meteorological Service |access-date=3 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.&lt;ref name="Climate Atlas of Greece (Hellenic National Meteorological Service)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Atlas of Greece|url=http://www.hnms.gr:80/hnms/greek/pdf/Climate_Atlas_Of_Greece.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921184739/http://www.hnms.gr/hnms/greek/pdf/Climate_Atlas_Of_Greece.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 September 2017|access-date=30 December 2019|publisher=Hellenic National Meteorological Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands and parts of the Central Continental Greece region. The [[Pindus]] mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a [[rain shadow]] effect).

The mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece (parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Central Greece]], [[Thessaly]], [[Western Macedonia]]) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese&amp;nbsp;– including parts of the regional units of [[Achaea]], [[Arcadia (regional unit)|Arcadia]] and [[Laconia]]&amp;nbsp;– feature an [[Alpine climate]] with heavy snowfalls. The inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia and [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] feature a [[temperate climate]] with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms. Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas, such as Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece - Climate|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece|access-date=21 June 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AAA 2108 (45718115542) (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]], Prime Minister since 2019]]

Since the restoration of democracy, the Greek party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) and the social-democratic [[PASOK|Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK).{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | For a diachronic analysis of the Greek party system see {{Harvnb | Pappas | 2003 | pp = 90–114}}, who distinguishes three distinct types of party system which developed in consecutive order, namely, a predominant-party system (from 1952 to 1963), a system of polarised pluralism (between 1963 and 1981), and a two-party system (since 1981).}} Other parties represented in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] include the [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA), the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), [[Greek Solution]] and [[MeRA25]].

PASOK and New Democracy largely alternated in power until the outbreak of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|government-debt crisis]] in 2009. From that time, the two major parties, New Democracy and PASOK, experienced a sharp decline in popularity.&lt;ref name="Political Climate and Governance December 2011"&gt;{{cite news | place = GR | url = http://www.vprc.gr/uplds/File/teleytaia%20nea/Epikaira/Political%20Climate%20and%20Governance_December2011.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150133/http://www.vprc.gr/uplds/File/teleytaia%20nea/Epikaira/Political%20Climate%20and%20Governance_December2011.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | title = Πολιτική Συγκυρία &amp; Διακυβέρνηση |trans-title=Political climate &amp; governance | date= 22 December 2011 | publisher = VPRC |access-date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Political Climate and Governance January 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/Political_Conjuncture_and_Governance_Jan2012.pdf | title = Πολιτική Συγκυρία &amp; Διακυβέρνηση |trans-title=Political conjuncture &amp; governance | place = GR | date = 26 January 2012 | work = VPRC |access-date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panhellenic Research for ET3"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/ToThePoint-Ert3_30-1-12.pdf |title = Πανελλαδικη Ερευνα για την ET3 | date = 29 January 2012 | work = To The Point |access-date=29 January 2012 |place = GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Research from Pulse RC for Pontiki"&gt;{{cite news | via = Ek logika | place = GR | url = http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/PulseRC-ToPontiki_2-2-2012.pdf | title = Ερευνα της Pulse RC για το Ποντικι |date=2 February 2012 |publisher=Pulse RC |access-date=2 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Varometro Feb 2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eklogika.gr/uploads/files/Dimoskopiseis/varometro_2_12.pdf |title = Πολιτικό Βαρόμετρο 99 |trans-title=Political barometer |date=7 February 2012 |work= Public Issue | publisher = Ek logika |access-date=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the two major parties joined the smaller [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] in a [[grand coalition]], pledging their parliamentary support for a [[government of national unity]] headed by former [[European Central Bank]] vice-president [[Lucas Papademos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Lucas Papademos named as new Greek prime minister |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15671354 |work=BBC News |date=10 November 2011 |access-date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Panos Kammenos]] voted against this government and he split off from ND forming the [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[Independent Greeks]].

The coalition government led the country to the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|parliamentary elections of May 2012]]. The power of the traditional Greek political parties, [[PASOK]] and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], declined from 43% to 13% and from 33% to 18%, respectively. The left-wing party of [[SYRIZA]] became the second major party, with an increase from 4% to 16%. No party could form a sustainable government, which led to the [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|parliamentary elections of June 2012]]. The result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (29%), [[PASOK]] (12%) and [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (6%) parties.

SYRIZA has since overtaken PASOK as the main party of the centre-left .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYQgDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=syriza%2520pasok%2520centre-left&amp;pg=PA94 |title=Radical Left Parties in Government: The Cases of SYRIZA and AKEL |last=Katsourides |first=Yiannos |date=22 September 2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137588418 |page=94 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis Tsipras]] led SYRIZA to victory in the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|general election]] held on 25 January 2015, falling short of an outright majority in Parliament by just two seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30975437|title=Greece election: Anti-austerity Syriza wins election|work=BBC News|date=26 January 2015|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning, Tsipras reached an agreement with [[Independent Greeks]] party to form a coalition, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jan/26/greece-election-syriza-victory-alexis-tsipras-coalition-talks-live-updates|title=Alexis Tsipras sworn in as new Greek prime minister – as it happened|first1=Graeme Wearden until 4 15pm|last1=GMT|first2=Mark|last2=Tran (now)|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsipras called snap elections in August 2015, resigning from his post, which led to a month-long caretaker administration headed by judge [[Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou]], Greece's first female prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economywatch.gr/vassiliki-thanou-christophilou-became-greeces-first-female-prime-minister/|title=Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou became Greece's first female Prime Minister &amp;#124; Economy Watch|first=D.|last=K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 general election]], Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34307795|title=Greece election: Alexis Tsipras hails 'victory of the people'|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2015|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/greek-finance-minister-tsakalotos-takes-key-role-in-tsipras-new-cabinet/a-18731437|title=Greek Finance Minister Tsakalotos takes key role in Tsipras' new cabinet &amp;#124; DW &amp;#124; 23.09.2015|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was defeated in the [[2019 Greek legislative election|July 2019 general election]] by [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] who leads New Democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/greeks-choose-between-beach-and-ballot-in-first-post-debt-bailout-poll|title=Greek elections: landslide victory for centre-right New Democracy party|date=7 July 2019|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2019, Kyriakos Mitsotakis was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Greece.

Greece's foreign policy is conducted through the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and its head, the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], currently [[Nikos Dendias]].

There is a long-standing [[Aegean dispute|conflict between Turkey and Greece]] over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey doesn't recognize a legal [[continental shelf]] and [[exclusive economic zone]] around the Greek islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey threatens Greece over disputed Mediterranean territorial claims |url=https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-threatens-greece-over-disputed-mediterranean-territorial-claims/a-54828554 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=5 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, due to its political and geographical proximity to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the Middle East and [[Africa]], Greece is a country of significant geostrategic importance, which it has leveraged to develop a regional policy to help promote peace and stability in the [[Balkans]], the [[Mediterranean]], and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="MFA regional policy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mfa.gr/en/foreign-policy/regional-policy/ | title= Regional Policy | publisher= [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] |access-date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has accorded the country [[middle power]] status in global affairs.&lt;ref name="Thanos-Veremēs"&gt;Thanos Veremēs (1997)[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_military_in_Greek_politics.html?id=sn-yAAAAIAAJ The Military in Greek Politics] "Black Rose Books"&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece is a member of numerous international organizations, including the [[Council of Europe]], the [[European Union]], the [[Union for the Mediterranean]], the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the [[Organisation internationale de la francophonie]] and the [[United Nations]], of which it is a founding member.

=== Law and justice ===
{{Main|Judicial system of Greece|Law enforcement in Greece}}

The [[Judicial system of Greece|Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] (Άρειος Πάγος), the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] (Συμβούλιο της Επικρατείας) and the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Court of Auditors]] (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο). The Judiciary system is also composed of civil courts, which judge civil and penal cases and administrative courts, which judge disputes between the citizens and the Greek administrative authorities.

The [[Hellenic Police]] ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Αστυνομία}}) is the national [[police]] force of Greece. It is a very large agency with its responsibilities ranging from [[road traffic control]] to [[counter-terrorism]]. It was established in 1984 under Law 1481/1-10-1984 (Government Gazette 152 A) as the result of the fusion of the [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] (Χωροφυλακή, ''Chorofylaki'') and the [[Cities Police]] (Αστυνομία Πόλεων, ''Astynomia Poleon'') forces.&lt;ref&gt;Law 1481/1 October 1984, ''Official Journal of the Hellenic Republic'', A-152&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellenic Armed Forces are overseen by the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] (Greek: Γενικό Επιτελείο Εθνικής Άμυνας&amp;nbsp;– ΓΕΕΘΑ), with civilian authority vested in the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]]. It consists of three branches:
* [[Hellenic Army]] (Ellinikos Stratos, ES)
* [[Hellenic Navy]] (Elliniko Polemiko Navtiko, EPN)
* [[Hellenic Air Force]] (Elliniki Polemiki Aeroporia, EPA)

Moreover, Greece maintains the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] for law enforcement at sea, search and rescue, and port operations. Though it can support the navy during wartime, it resides under the authority of the [[Ministry of Shipping (Greece)|Ministry of Shipping]].

Greek military personnel total 364,050, of whom 142,700 are active and 221,350 are reserve. Greece [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel|ranks 28th in the world]] in the number of citizens serving in the armed forces. [[Conscription in Greece|Mandatory military service]] is nine months for the Army and one year for the Navy and Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook -- Greece|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/greece/ |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Greek males between the ages of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard.

As a member of [[NATO]], the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance, although its involvement in NATO missions is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dempsey|first1=Judy|title=EU and NATO Look on at Greece's Pampered Armed Forces|url=http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/49185 |publisher=Carnegie Europe|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece spends over US$7 billion annually on its military, or 2.3 percent of GDP, the [[List of countries by military expenditures|24th-highest in the world]] in absolute terms, the [[List of countries by military expenditure per capita|seventh-highest]] on a per capita basis, and the second-highest in NATO after the United States. Moreover, Greece is one of only five NATO countries to meet or surpass the minimum defence spending target of 2 percent of GDP.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greece}}
Since the [[Kallikratis programme]] reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece has consisted of 13 [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] subdivided into a total of 325 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]]. The 54 old [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures and prefecture-level administrations]] have been largely retained as ''[[regional units of Greece|sub-units]]'' of the regions. Seven [[Decentralized administrations of Greece|decentralised administrations]] group one to three regions for administrative purposes on a regional basis. There is also one [[autonomous area]], [[Mount Athos]] ({{lang-el|Agio Oros}}, "Holy Mountain"), which borders the region of [[Central Macedonia]].

Greece was a founding member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] (BSEC). In 1979 the accession of the country in the [[European Communities]] and the [[Internal Market (European Union)|single market]] was signed, and the process was completed in 1982. Greece was accepted into the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] on 19 June 2000, and in January 2001 adopted the [[Euro]] as its currency, replacing the [[Greek drachma]] at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachma to the Euro.&lt;ref name="Drachma exchange rate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixed Euro conversion rates | url =http://www.ecb.int/euro/intro/html/index.en.html|publisher=European Central Bank|access-date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece is also a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]], and is ranked 24th on the KOF [[Globalization Index]] for 2013.

=== Debt crisis (2010–2018) ===
{{Main|Greek government-debt crisis}}
[[File:Greek debt and EU average since 1977.png|upright=1.364|thumb|Greece's debt percentage since 1977, compared to the average of the [[Eurozone]]]]

The Greek economy had fared well for much of the 20th century, with high growth rates and low public debt&lt;ref name="Debt Past"&gt;{{cite news|title=2010-2018 Greek Debt Crisis and Greece's Past: Myths, Popular Notions and Implications |url =https://www.academia.edu/37583185 |publisher=Academia.edu |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even until the eve of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]], it featured high rates of growth, which, however, were coupled with high structural deficits, thus maintaining a (roughly unchanged throughout this period) public debt to GDP ratio of just over 100%.&lt;ref name="Debt Past"/&gt; The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the 2007–2009 [[Great Recession]], which led the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.&lt;ref name="Debt Past"/&gt; In Greece's case, the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections and revisions, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2% and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (relatively stable, at just over 100% until 2007 - as calculated after all corrections). Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.&lt;ref name="Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=teina225&amp;language=en|title= Eurostat (Government debt data)|work= Eurostat |access-date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]]. 
Finally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due to the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which led to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|about 10%]], i.e., a public debt to GDP of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of [[Greek government-debt crisis#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was "punished" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.

The above revisions were largely connected with the fact that in the years before the crisis [[Goldman Sachs]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and numerous other banks had developed financial products which enabled the governments of Greece, [[Italy]], and many other [[Europe]]an countries to hide their borrowing.&lt;ref name="Europe derivatives 1"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Greece not alone in exploiting EU accounting flaws | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61L3EB20100222 |work=Reuters | date = 22 February 2010 |access-date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Europe derivatives 2"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Greece is far from the EU's only joker | url = http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/wealth-of-nations/2010/02/19/greece-is-far-from-the-eu-s-only-joker.html |work=Newsweek| date = 19 February 2010 |access-date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Euro PIIGS out | url = http://librus.ca/2010/10/the-euro-piigs-out | work = Librus Magazine | date = 22 October 2010 | access-date = 17 May 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820012838/http://librus.ca/2010/10/the-euro-piigs-out/ | archive-date = 20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'Creative accounting' masks EU budget deficit problems | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133622280.html | work = Sunday Business | date = 26 June 2005 | access-date = 17 May 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515060036/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133622280.html | archive-date = 15 May 2013 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = How Europe's governments have enronized their debts

[[File:The Rio - Antirrio Bridge at sunset.jpg|thumb|The [[Rio–Antirrio bridge]] connects mainland Greece to the [[Peloponnese]].]]
Since the 1980s, the road and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernised. Important works include the [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|A2 (Egnatia Odos)]] motorway, that connects northwestern Greece ([[Igoumenitsa]]) with northern Greece (Thessaloniki) and northeastern Greece ([[Kipoi, Evros|Kipoi]]); the [[Rio–Antirrio bridge]], the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe ({{convert|2250|m|0|abbr=on}} long), connecting the Peloponnese ([[Rio, Greece|Rio]], {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Patras]]) with Aetolia-Akarnania ([[Antirrio]]) in western Greece.

Also completed are the [[Ionia Odos|A5 (Ionia Odos)]] motorway that connects northwestern Greece ([[Ioannina]]) with western Greece (Antirrio); the last sections of the [[Motorway 1 (Greece)|A1 motorway]], connecting Athens to [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Evzonoi]] in northern Greece; as well as the [[Motorway 8 (Greece)|A8 motorway]] (part of the [[Olympia Odos]]) in Peloponnese, connecting Athens to Patras. The remaining section of Olympia Odos, connecting Patras with [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]], is under planning.

Other important projects that are currently underway, include the construction of the [[Thessaloniki Metro]].

The Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe, such as the [[Athens International Airport]], the privately run [[Attiki Odos|A6 (Attiki Odos)]] motorway network and the expanded [[Athens Metro]] system.

Most of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]]. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]].

Railway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/[[commuter rail]] connections, serviced by [[Proastiakos]] around Athens, towards its airport, [[Kiato]] and [[Chalcis|Chalkida]]; around Thessaloniki, towards the cities of [[Larissa]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]]; and around Patras. A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established, while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} network is underway; along with a [[P.A.Th.E./P.|new double track, standard gauge]] railway between [[Athens]] and [[Patras]] (replacing the old [[metre-gauge railway|metre-gauge]] [[Piraeus–Patras railway]]) which is currently under construction and opening in stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ergose.gr/view.php?&amp;id=19&amp;lang_code=en ERGOSE - Investment Program], 30 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the Balkans and Turkey.

=== Telecommunications ===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Greece}}

Modern digital information and communication networks reach all areas. There are over {{convert|35000|km|0|abbr=on}} of fiber optics and an extensive open-wire network. Broadband internet availability is widespread in Greece: there were a total of 2,252,653 broadband connections {{as of|2011|alt=as of early 2011}}, translating to 20% broadband penetration.&lt;ref name="cnbc"&gt;{{cite news | date = 2 May 2011 | url=http://news.in.gr/science-technology/article/?aid=1231106170 |script-title=el:''Το 20% του πληθυσμού πλησιάζει η διείσδυση της ευρυζωνικότητας στην Ελλάδα'' |trans-title=20% of the population approaching broadband penetration in Greece |language=el |publisher=in.gr |access-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2017 data, around 82% of the general population used the internet regularly.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/922914/article/texnologia/diadiktyo/to--818-twn-ellhnwn-serfarei-sto-diadiktyo|title=Το 81,8 των Ελληνων σερφαρει στο ιντερνετ|trans-title=81.8% of Greeks surf the Internet|publisher=Kathimerini.gr |access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Secretariat for Research and Technology of the Ministry of Development and Competitiveness is responsible for designing, implementing and supervising national research and technological policy. In 2017, spending on research and development (R&amp;D) reached an all-time high of €2 billion, equal to 1.14 percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeknewsagenda.gr/index.php/topics/business-r-d/6889-r-d-spending-2017|title=R&amp;D spending in Greece reached a record high in 2017|website=www.greeknewsagenda.gr|access-date=3 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lower than the EU average of 1.93 percent, between 1990 and 1998, total R&amp;D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third-highest increase in Europe, after [[Finland]] and Ireland. Because of its strategic location, qualified workforce, and political and economic stability, many multinational companies such as [[Ericsson]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Motorola]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] have their regional R&amp;D headquarters in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lambert |first1=Fred |title=Tesla is building an electric motor R&amp;D group in Greece to tap into strong local electrical engineering talent |url=https://electrek.co/2018/02/24/tesla-electric-motor-research-group-greece/ |website=Electrek.co |date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek society has changed rapidly over the last several decades, coinciding with the [[Aging of Europe|wider European trend]] of declining fertility and rapid aging. The [[birth rate]] in 2003 stood at 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants, significantly lower than the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 in 1981. At the same time, the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003. Estimates from 2016 show the birth rate decreasing further still to 8.5 per 1,000 and mortality climbing to 11.2 per 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/greece/|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greecepop.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Population pyramid of Greece in 2017]] 
The [[fertility rate]] of 1.41 children per woman is well below the [[Replacement fertility rate|replacement rate of 2.1]], and is one of the lowest in the world, considerably below the high of 5.47 children born per woman in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman?year=1800&amp;country=GRC|title=Total Fertility Rate around the world over the last centuries|author=Max Roser|date=2014|work=[[Our World in Data]], [[Gapminder Foundation]]|access-date=7 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807155725/https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman?year=1800&amp;country=GRC|archive-date=7 August 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Greece's median age is 44.2 years, the seventh-highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/greece/|title=World Factbook EUROPE : GREECE|work=[[The World Factbook]]|date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger.&lt;ref name="nssg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf|title=Greece in Numbers|publisher=[[Hellenic Statistical Authority]]|year=2006|access-date=14 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707190604/http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf|archive-date=7 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the proportion of the population age 65 and older had risen to 20.68 percent, while the proportion of those aged 14 and younger declined to slightly below 14 percent.

Marriage rates began declining from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004.&lt;ref name=nssg /&gt; Moreover, divorce rates have seen an increase from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.&lt;ref name=nssg /&gt;

As a result of these trends, the average Greek household is smaller and older than in previous generations. The economic crisis has exacerbated this development, with 350,000-450,000 Greeks, predominantly young adults, emigrating since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/24866436-9f9f-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4|title=Greece brain drain hampers recovery from economic crisis|last=Hope|first=Kerin|date=16 August 2018|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=3 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 500,000 Muslims from Greece, predominantly those defined as [[Turkish people|Turks]], but also [[Greek Muslims]] like the [[Vallahades]] of western Macedonia, were exchanged with approximately 1.5 million Greeks from Turkey. However, many refugees who settled in former Ottoman Muslim villages in [[Central Macedonia]], and were defined as Christian Orthodox [[Caucasus Greeks]], arrived from the former Russian [[Transcaucasus]] province of [[Kars Oblast]], after it had been retroceded to Turkey prior to the official population exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website= Countrystudies.us |url= http://countrystudies.us/turkey/24.htm |title= Turkey&amp;nbsp;– Population | place = US | publisher = [[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first textual evidence of the Greek language dates back to 15th century BC and the [[Linear B]] script which is associated with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Civilization]]. Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.

During the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.

Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group. The [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the [[Sarakatsani]], traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of [[Greek Macedonia]] and other parts of [[Northern Greece]]. The [[Tsakonian language]], a distinct Greek language deriving from [[Doric Greek]] instead of [[Koine Greek]], is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.

The [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]]){{Sfn | Trudgill | 2000}} and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.

Today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians]], also known as "[[Vlachs]]", whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece. Members of these groups usually identify ethnically as Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cilevics.eu/minelres/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm | publisher = Greek Helsinki Monitor | title = Minority Rights Group, Greece, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) | date = 8 September 1999 | access-date = 27 December 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111161345/http://www.cilevics.eu/minelres/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm | archive-date = 11 January 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are today all at least bilingual in Greek.

Near the northern Greek borders there are also some [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavic–speaking groups]], locally known as ''Slavomacedonian''-speaking, most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks. It is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923, [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] had 200,000 to 400,000 [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] speakers.&lt;ref name="minorities"&gt;Roudometof, Victor; Robertson, Roland (2001).

[[Westport, Connecticut]]: [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]]. p. 186. {{ISBN|978-0-313-31949-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (Judeo-Spanish), today maintained only by a few thousand speakers. Other notable minority languages include [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the [[Urums]], a community of [[Caucasus Greeks]] from the [[Tsalka]] region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern [[Greeks in Ukraine|Ukraine]] who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s.

=== Migration ===

Throughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks migrated to the [[Greek Americans|United States]], [[Greeks in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Greek Australians|Australia]], [[Greek Canadians|Canada]], and [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]], creating a large [[Greek diaspora]]. Net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s, but until the beginning of the 1990s, the main influx was that of returning Greek migrants or of [[Pontic Greeks]] and others from [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]], [[Greeks in Georgia|Georgia]], [[Greeks in Turkey|Turkey]] the [[Greeks in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], and elsewhere in the former [[Soviet Bloc]].&lt;ref name=eliamep&gt;Triandafyllidou, Anna.

A study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of the total population. Of the non-citizen residents, 48,560 were EU or [[European Free Trade Association]] nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status. The majority come from Eastern European countries: Albania (56%), Bulgaria (5%) and Romania (3%), while migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;Kasimis, Charalambos; Kassimi, Chryssa (June 2004).

The greatest cluster of non-EU [[immigrant]] population are the larger urban centers, especially the Municipality of Athens, with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17% of the local population, and then Thessaloniki, with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7% of the local population.

Greece, together with [[Italy]] and Spain, is a major entry point for [[European migrant crisis|illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU]]. Illegal immigrants entering Greece mostly do so from the border with [[Turkey]] at the [[Evros River]] and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey (mainly [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Kos]], and [[Samos]]).

Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in ''[[paideia]]'' (education), which was upheld as one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world. The first European institution described as a university was founded in fifth-century Constantinople and continued operating in various incarnations until the [[Fall of Constantinople|city's fall]] to the Ottomans in 1453.&lt;ref name="texor"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090220164836/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html|archive-date= 20 February 2009 |title=Jerome Bump, University of Constantinople|access-date=19 December 2008|website= The Origin of Universities |publisher= University of Texas at Austin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Constantinople]] was Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tatakes |first=Vasileios N. |author2=Moutafakis, Nicholas J. |title=Byzantine Philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=978-0-87220-563-5|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by some measures was the world's first university.&lt;ref name="texor" /&gt;

Compulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (Δημοτικό Σχολείο, ''Dimotikó Scholeio'') and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (Γυμνάσιο). Nursery schools (Παιδικός σταθμός, ''Paidikós Stathmós'') are popular but not compulsory. [[Kindergarten]]s (Νηπιαγωγείο, ''Nipiagogeío'') are now compulsory for any child above four years of age. Children start primary school aged six and remain there for six years. Attendance at gymnasia starts at age 12 and lasts for three years.

Greece's post-compulsory secondary education consists of two school types: unified upper secondary schools (Γενικό Λύκειο, ''Genikό Lykeiό'') and [[technical school|technical]]–[[vocational school|vocational]] educational schools (Τεχνικά και Επαγγελματικά Εκπαιδευτήρια, "TEE"). Post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes (Ινστιτούτα Επαγγελματικής Κατάρτισης, "IEK") which provide a formal but unclassified level of education. As they can accept both ''Gymnasio'' (lower secondary school) and ''Lykeio'' (upper secondary school) graduates, these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education.

According to the Framework Law (3549/2007), Public higher education "Highest Educational Institutions" (Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα, ''Anótata Ekpaideytiká Idrýmata'', "ΑΕΙ") consists of two parallel sectors:the university sector (Universities, Polytechnics, Fine Arts Schools, the Open University) and the Technological sector (Technological Education Institutions (TEI) and the School of Pedagogic and Technological Education). There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration (2 to 3 years) which operate under the authority of other Ministries. Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery. The [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens|Capodistrian University of Athens]] is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.

The Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. There are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological, and physical education.

Seventy-two percent of Greek adults aged 25–64 have completed upper secondary education, which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74 percent. The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is lower than the OECD average of 486. On average, girls outperformed boys by 15 points, much more than the average OECD gap of two points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Better Life Index - Greece|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/greece/|website=oecdbetterlifeindex.org|publisher=OECD|access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epidavros.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus]], still used for theatrical plays.]]

The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in [[Mycenaean Greece]] and continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its [[Greek East]]ern continuation, the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other cultures and nations, such as the [[Frankokratia|Latin and Frankish states]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Venetian Republic]], the [[Genoese Republic]], and the [[British Empire]] have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, although historians credit the [[Greek War of Independence]] with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.

In ancient times, Greece was the birthplace of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazlish, Bruce.

Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the [[art of ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/edwards/pharaohs/pharaohs-5.html|title=Egypt the Birthplace of Greek Decorative Art|website=digital.library.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]]. Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]].

[[Ancient Greek sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] in the late 20th century, that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact.&lt;ref name=Gurewitsch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurewitsch |first= Matthew |date=July 2008 |title= True Colors |journal= Smithsonian |pages= 66–71 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art production continued also during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its "abstract", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favour of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. The [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)]] was the artistic expression of [[Macedonian Renaissance]], a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867–1056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.

Post Byzantine art schools include the [[Cretan School]] and [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]. The first artistic movement in the [[Greek Kingdom]] can be considered the [[Greek academic art of the 19th century]] (''Munich School''). Notable modern Greek painters include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Theodoros Vryzakis]], [[Nikiforos Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]], [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] and [[Yannis Tsarouchis]], while some notable sculptors are [[Pavlos Prosalentis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Leonidas Drosis]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Yannoulis Chalepas]].

=== Architecture ===

[[File:20190509 137 vatheia.jpg|alt=|thumb|Towerhouses of [[Vatheia]] in [[Mani peninsula]].]]
The architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (''Hellenes''), whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Aegean Islands]] and their [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]], for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods.

Byzantine architecture is the [[architecture]] promoted by the [[Byzantine Empire]], also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a [[millennium]], dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture]] throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman architectural]] traditions that followed its collapse.

After the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.&lt;ref&gt;Παύλος Κυριαζής, «Σταμάτης Βούλγαρης. Ο αγωνιστής, ο πολεοδόμος, ο άνθρωπος», στο: Συλλογικό, Πρώτοι Έλληνες τεχνικοί επιστήμονες περιόδου απελευθέρωσης, εκδ. Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος, Αθήνα, 1976, σελ.158&lt;/ref&gt;

Two special genres can be considered the [[Cycladic architecture]], featuring white-coloured houses, in the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Epirotic architecture]] in the region of [[Epirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travelaway.me/cycladic-architecture/|title=23 Best Examples of Cycladic Architecture|date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greeka.com/epirus/architecture/|title=Architecture of Epirus, Greece - Greeka.com|website=Greekacom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important is also the influence of the [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian style]] in the [[Ionian islands]] and the "Mediterranean style" of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] (during the years of the fascist regime) in the [[Dodecanese|Dodecanese islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Sean|date=2010|title=The Light and the Line: Florestano Di Fausto and the Politics of 'Mediterraneità'|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9hm1p6m5#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]]. For Athens, the first [[King of Greece]], [[Otto of Greece]], commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state. As for [[Thessaloniki]], after the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917|fire of 1917]], the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of [[Ernest Hébrard]]. Other modern Greek architects include [[Anastasios Metaxas]], [[Lysandros Kaftanzoglou]], [[Panagis Kalkos]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Xenophon Paionidis]], [[Dimitris Pikionis]] and [[Georges Candilis]].

Boston; London: [[Allyn &amp; Bacon]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens]], which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honoured the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there.

During the Byzantine period, the theatrical art was heavily declined. According to Marios Ploritis, the only form survived was the folk theatre (''Mimos'' and ''Pantomimos''), despite the hostility of the official state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24grammata.com/?p=32749 |title=Culture e-Magazine&amp;nbsp;– Free eBooks&amp;nbsp;– WebTV " Τo Θέατρο στο Βυζάντιο και την Οθωμανική περίοδο |publisher=24grammata.com |date=18 March 2012 |access-date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the Ottoman period, the main theatrical folk art was the ''[[Karagiozis]]''. The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the [[Venetian Crete]]. Significal dramatists include [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] and [[Georgios Chortatzis]].

The modern Greek theatre was born after the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek independence]], in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]] was the first theatre and [[opera]] house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by [[revues]], [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]], [[operettas]] and [[nocturnes]] and notable playwrights included [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Dionysios Lavrangas]], [[Theophrastos Sakellaridis]] and others.

The [[National Theatre of Greece]] was opened in 1900 as ''Royal Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.n-t.gr/el/knowus|title=ΓΝΩΡΙΣΤΕ ΜΑΣ - Εθνικό Θέατρο|website=n-t.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Pantelis Horn]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]] and [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], while notable actors include [[Cybele Andrianou]], [[Marika Kotopouli]], [[Aimilios Veakis]], [[Orestis Makris]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Manos Katrakis]] and [[Dimitris Horn]].

Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&amp;nbsp;BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]]; [[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]]. The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.

Of the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period. The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.

[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]]. Although ''popular'' Byzantine literature and early [[Modern Greek literature]] both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Modern Greek language in its relation to Ancient Greek", [[E.

[[Modern Greek literature]] refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century. The Cretan Renaissance poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is considered the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553–1613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment ([[Diafotismos]]), writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] prepared with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821–1830).

Leading figures of modern Greek literature include [[Dionysios Solomos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Emmanuel Rhoides]], [[Demetrius Vikelas]], [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Penelope Delta]], [[Yannis Ritsos]], [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Andreas Embeirikos]], [[Kostas Karyotakis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], [[Nikos Kavvadias]], [[Kostas Varnalis]] and [[Kiki Dimoula]]. Two Greek authors have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[George Seferis]] in 1963 and [[Odysseas Elytis]] in 1979.

=== Philosophy ===

Most western philosophical traditions began in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BC. The first philosophers are called "Presocratics," which designates that they came before [[Socrates]], whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.

A new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.

[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given to us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher= Internet encyclopedia of philosophy|access-date= 23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byzantine philosophy]] refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a [[Christianity|Christian]] world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Neoplatonists]].

On the eve of the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Gemistus Pletho]] tried to restore the use of the term "Hellene" and advocated the return to the [[Olympian Gods]] of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek Byzantine scholars]] who fled to western Europe contributed to the [[Renaissance]].

In modern period, [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|Diafotismos]] (Greek: Διαφωτισμός, "enlightenment", "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were [[Adamantios Korais]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Theophilos Kairis]].

Other modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and [[Christos Yannaras]].

=== Music and dances ===

Greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] also had effect on Greek music.

While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.

Along with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] (''Demotiko'') which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.

The [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kantádhes]] (καντάδες '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: καντάδα) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theater scene.

[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[laïkó]] (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], [[Grigoris Bithikotsis]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]] and [[Glykeria]].

Regarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek: ''Επτανησιακή Σχολή''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.

In the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of [[avant garde]] and modern [[classical music]], with figures such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]], [[Vangelis]] and [[Demis Roussos]] garnered an international following for their music, which include famous [[film score]]s such as [[Zorba the Greek]], [[Serpico]], [[Never on Sunday]], [[America America]], [[Eternity and a Day]], [[Chariots of Fire]], [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]], among others. [[Greek American]] composers known for their film scores include also [[Yanni]] and [[Basil Poledouris]]. Notable Greek [[opera]] singers and [[classical music]]ians of the 20th and 21st century include [[Maria Callas]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Mario Frangoulis]], [[Leonidas Kavakos]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]] and others.

During the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|dictatorship of the Colonels]], the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a [[concentration camp]],&lt;ref name="Hischak2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas S. Hischak|title=The Encyclopedia of Film Composers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xz99CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA664|date=16 April 2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-4550-1|page=664}}&lt;/ref&gt; before finally being allowed to leave Greece due to international reaction to his detention. Released during the junta years, ''Anthrope Agapa, ti Fotia Stamata'' (Make Love, Stop the Gunfire), by the [[Pop music|pop]] group [[Poll (band)|Poll]] is considered the first anti-war protest song in the history of [[Greek rock]].&lt;ref name=europopmusic.eu&gt;{{cite web|title=Kostas Tournas|url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/Greece_pages/Kostas_Tournas.html#about|publisher=europopmusic.eu|access-date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was echoing the hippie slogan [[Make love, not war]] and was inspired directly by the [[Vietnam War]], becoming a "smash hit" in Greece.&lt;ref name="Kornetis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kostis Kornetis|title=Children of the Dictatorship: Student Resistance, Cultural Politics and the 'Long 1960s' in Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_UcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|date=30 November 2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-001-6|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] 35 times after its debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]]. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]], Greece won with the song "[[My Number One]]", performed by Greek-Swedish singer [[Elena Paparizou]]. The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Albania, Cyprus, Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece. The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|51st Eurovision Song Contest]] was held in [[Athens]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]] of the [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex]] in [[Maroussi]], with hosted by [[Maria Menounos]] and [[Sakis Rouvas]].

=== Cuisine ===

[[File:Greek Salad from Thessaloniki.jpg|alt=|thumb|A [[Greek salad]], with [[feta]] and [[olive]]s.]]
[[Greek cuisine]] is characteristic of the healthy [[Mediterranean diet]], which is epitomised by dishes of [[Cretan diet|Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sari |last=Edelstein |title=Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lj0CeaIIETkC&amp;pg=PA147 |access-date=27 December 2011 |date=22 October 2010 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn= 978-0-7637-5965-0 |pages=147–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as [[moussaka]], [[pastitsio]], classic [[Greek salad]], [[fasolada]], [[spanakopita]] and [[souvlaki]]. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]] (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and [[Sesame seed candy|pasteli]] (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled octopus and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.

Some sweet desserts include [[melomakarona]], [[diples]] and [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including retsina. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], garlic, [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use "sweet" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]]s in stews.

{{Main|Greek cinema}}
Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens. In 1914, the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films began. ''Golfo'' (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek [[feature film]], although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''Δάφνις και Χλόη''), containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944, [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

[[File:Theodoros Angelopoulos Athens 26-4-2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|[[Theodoros Angelopoulos]], winner of the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|1998]], notable director in the history of the [[European cinema]]]]

The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a "golden age" of Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognised as important figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[George Tzavellas]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]] and others. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Some notable films include ''[[The Drunkard (1950 film)|The Drunkard]]'' (1950, directed by [[George Tzavellas]]), ''[[The Counterfeit Coin]]'' (1955, by [[Giorgos Tzavellas]]), ''Πικρό Ψωμί'' (1951, by [[Grigoris Grigoriou]]), ''[[O Drakos]]'' (1956, by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955, directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis), ''[[Woe to the Young]]'' (1961, by [[Alekos Sakellarios]]), ''[[Glory Sky]]'' (1962, by [[Takis Kanellopoulos]]) and ''[[The Red Lanterns]]'' (1963, by [[Vasilis Georgiadis]])

Cacoyannis also directed ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed in this period with movies such as ''Λατέρνα, Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο'', ''[[Madalena (film)|Madalena]]'', ''[[I theia ap' to Chicago]]'', ''Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο'' and many more.

During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].

There are also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora, such as the Greek-French [[Costa-Gavras]] and the Greek-Americans [[Elia Kazan]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Alexander Payne]].

More recently [[Yorgos Lanthimos]] (film and stage director, producer, and screenwriter) has received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for his work, including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] for ''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'' (2009), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for ''[[The Lobster]]'' (2015), and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''[[The Favourite]]'' (2018).

=== Mythology ===
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
The numerous gods of the [[ancient Greek religion]] as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek [[epic (genre)|epics]] (''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[The Iliad]]'') and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.

The principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to his sister, [[Hera]]. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]], and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.

=== Public holidays and festivals ===
{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}
[[File:Virgin Mary procession, Chora of Naxos, 118916.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Procession in honor of the Assumption of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (15 August)]]

According to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late '70s, Saturday also is a non-school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (''[[Greek Independence Day]]''), [[Easter Monday]], 15 August (''[[Dormition of the Mother of God|Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin]]''), and 25 December (''[[Christmas]]''). 1 May (''[[Labour Day]]'') and 28 October (''[[Ohi Day]]'') are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.

In addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a "Patron Saint" parallel to "[[Name days in Greece|Name Days]]", or a "Liberation Day". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.

Notable festivals, beyond the religious fests, include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;loc=1&amp;page=586|script-title=el:Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης – Προφίλ|trans-title=Thessaloniki International Film Festival – Profile|language=el|access-date=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;loc=1&amp;page=586|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
