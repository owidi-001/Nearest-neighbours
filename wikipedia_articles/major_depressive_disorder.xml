Depressed children may often display an irritable mood rather than a depressed one,&lt;ref name=APA349 /&gt; and show varying symptoms depending on age and situation.&lt;ref name=APA354&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lose interest in school and show a decline in academic performance.

===Associated conditions===
Major depression frequently [[Comorbidity|co-occurs]] with other psychiatric problems.

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of people who have depression, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of people who are experiencing pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics.

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity.

[[Child abuse|Childhood abuse]], either physical, sexual or psychological, are all risk factors for depression, among other psychiatric issues that co-occur such as anxiety and [[substance use disorder]]s. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, lack of response to treatment and length of illness. However, some are more susceptible to developing mental illness such as depression after trauma, and various genes have been suggested to control susceptibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saveanu RV, Nemeroff CB |title=Etiology of depression: genetic and environmental factors |journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=51–71 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22370490 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2011.12.001 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221866686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{see|Biology of depression|Epigenetics of depression}}
The pathophysiology of depression is not yet understood, but the current theories center around [[monoamine]]rgic systems, the [[circadian rhythm]], immunological dysfunction, [[HPA axis]] dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.

The monoamine theory, derived from the efficacy of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, was the dominant theory until recently {{when|date=May 2020}}. The theory postulates that insufficient activity of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. Firstly, acute depletion of [[tryptophan]], a necessary precursor of [[serotonin]], a monoamine, can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of people who are depressed; this suggests that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruhé HG, Mason NS, Schene AH |title=Mood is indirectly related to serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in humans: a meta-analysis of monoamine depletion studies |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=331–59 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17389902 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001949 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the [[5-HTTLPR]] gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link.

===Clinical assessment===
{{further|Rating scales for depression}}

A diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a suitably trained [[general practitioner]], or by a [[psychiatrist]] or [[psychologist]],&lt;ref name="NIMHPub" /&gt; who [[psychiatric history|records]] the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, family history, and alcohol and drug use.

Before diagnosing major depressive disorder, a doctor generally performs a medical examination and selected investigations to rule out other causes of symptoms. These include blood tests measuring [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] and [[thyroxine]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism]]; [[Blood tests#Biochemical analysis|basic electrolytes]] and serum [[calcium]] to rule out a [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]]; and a [[Complete blood count|full blood count]] including [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] to rule out a [[systemic infection]] or chronic disease.&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dale J, Sorour E, Milner G |year=2008 |title=Do psychiatrists perform appropriate physical investigations for their patients?

===DSM and ICD criteria===
The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' and the [[World Health Organization]]'s ''[[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' which uses the name ''depressive episode'' for a single episode and ''recurrent depressive disorder'' for repeated episodes.&lt;ref name="ICD-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|title=Mental and behavioural disorders: Mood [affective] disorders|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=2010|access-date=8 November 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102133725/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|archive-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.&lt;ref name=APA372&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both DSM-5 and ICD-10 mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="DSMvsICD" /&gt; ICD-10 defines three typical depressive symptoms (depressed mood, [[anhedonia]], and reduced energy), two of which should be present to determine the depressive disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name="DSM-10 diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines|url=https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|date=2010|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=12 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323025330/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|archive-date=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioral disorders. Clinical description and diagnostic guideline. Geneva: World Health Organization, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; According to DSM-5, there are two main depressive symptoms: a depressed mood, and loss of interest/pleasure in activities (anhedonia). These symptoms, as well as five out of the nine more specific symptoms listed, must frequently occur for more than two weeks (to the extent in which it impairs functioning) for the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psnpaloalto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Depression-Diagnostic-Criteria-and-Severity-Rating.pdf|title=Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and Depressive Episodes|website=City of Palo Alto Project Safety Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category [[Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified|Unspecified Depressive Disorder]] is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ICD-10 system does not use the term ''major depressive disorder'' but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term ''recurrent'' may be added if there have been multiple episodes without [[mania]].&lt;ref name="ICD-10" /&gt;

====Major depressive episode====
{{Main|Major depressive episode}}
[[File:A wretched man with an approaching depression; represented b Wellcome V0011145.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature of a man with depression]]
A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.&lt;ref name=APA349 /&gt; Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning).

====Subtypes====
The DSM-5 recognizes six further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:
* "[[Melancholic depression]]" is characterized by [[anhedonia|a loss of pleasure in most or all activities]], a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Atypical depression]]" is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Catatonia|Catatonic]] depression" is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in [[schizophrenia]] or in manic episodes, or may be caused by [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=417–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Depression with [[Anxiety|anxious]] distress" was added into the DSM-V as a means to emphasize the common co-occurrence between depression or [[mania]] and anxiety, as well as the risk of suicide of depressed individuals with anxiety. Specifying in such a way can also help with the prognosis of those diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*"Depression with [[Postpartum depression|peri-partum]] onset" refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth or while a woman is pregnant. DSM-IV-TR used the classification "postpartum depression," but this was changed in order to not exclude cases of depressed woman during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5.|author=DSM-5 Task Force|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=9780890425541|oclc=1026055291|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression with peripartum onset has an incidence rate of 10–15% among new mothers. The DSM-V mandates that, in order to qualify as depression with peripartum onset, onset occur during pregnancy or within one month of delivery. It has been said that postpartum depression can last as long as three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nonacs, Ruta M |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |publisher=eMedicine |title=Postpartum depression |date=4 December 2007 |access-date=30 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013205912/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |archive-date=13 October 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Seasonal affective disorder]]" (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Main|Depression (differential diagnoses)}}

To confirm major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other [[Differential diagnosis|potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including [[dysthymia]], [[adjustment disorder]] with depressed mood, or [[bipolar disorder]]. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''[[double depression]]'').&lt;ref name="harvnb" /&gt; [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.&lt;ref name="psychiatric355" /&gt; [[Bipolar disorder]], also known as ''manic–depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of [[mania]] or [[hypomania]]. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further differential diagnoses includes ruling out [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawk C, Jason LA, Torres-Harding S |title=Differential diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and major depressive disorder |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=244–51 |date=1 January 2006 |pmid=17078775 |doi=10.1207/s15327558ijbm1303_8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.574.3376 |s2cid=3604734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, [[medications]], and [[substance use disorder]]s. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a [[Mood disorder#Due to another medical condition|mood disorder due to a general medical condition]]. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or [[physical examination]]. When the depression is caused by a medication, non-medical use of a psychoactive substance, or exposure to a [[toxin]], it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called ''substance-induced mood disorder'' in the DSM-IV-TR).&lt;ref name="DSM5"/&gt;

==Screening and prevention==
Since 2016, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) has recommended screening for depression among those over the age 12;&lt;ref name=US2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siu AL, Bibbins-Domingo K, Grossman DC, Baumann LC, Davidson KW, Ebell M, García FA, Gillman M, Herzstein J, Kemper AR, Krist AH, Kurth AE, Owens DK, Phillips WR, Phipps MG, Pignone MP |title=Screening for Depression in Adults: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement |journal=JAMA |volume=315 |issue=4 |pages=380–87 |date=January 2016 |pmid=26813211 |doi=10.1001/jama.2015.18392 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US2016Peds&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siu AL |title=Screening for Depression in Children and Adolescents: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=164 |issue=5 |pages=360–66 |date=March 2016 |pmid=26858097 |doi=10.7326/M15-2957 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; though a 2005 [[Cochrane review]] found that the routine use of screening questionnaires has little effect on detection or treatment.&lt;ref name=Gil2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbody S, House AO, Sheldon TA |title=Screening and case finding instruments for depression |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4 |page=CD002792 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16235301 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002792.pub2 |pmc=6769050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported [[Churn rate|attrition rates]], and had a well-defined intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Jané-Llopis E, Hosman C, Jenkins R, Anderson P |year=2003 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |title=Predictors of efficacy in depression prevention programmes |website=British Journal of Psychiatry |access-date=2 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083702/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the "Coping with Depression" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.&lt;ref name=Munoz2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuijpers2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuijpers P, Muñoz RF, Clarke GN, Lewinsohn PM |title=Psychoeducational treatment and prevention of depression: the "Coping with Depression" course thirty years later |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=449–58 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19450912 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Management of depression}}
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the [[risk-benefit ratio]] is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

:* People with a history of moderate or severe depression
:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of [[relapse]], and that [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] are better tolerated than [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |access-date=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=December 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archive-date=15 November 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and personal preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) or [[light therapy]]. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all people with severe depression unless ECT is planned.&lt;ref name=apaguidelines/&gt; There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archer J, Bower P, Gilbody S, Lovell K, Richards D, Gask L, Dickens C, Coventry P | title = Collaborative care for depression and anxiety problems | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | page = CD006525 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23076925 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006525.pub2 | hdl = 10871/13751 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.&lt;ref name=Patel04&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel V, Araya R, Bolton P |title=Treating depression in the developing world |journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=539–41 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15117296 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01243.x |s2cid=73073889 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox GR, Callahan P, Churchill R, Hunot V, Merry SN, Parker AG, Hetrick SE |title=Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=CD008324 |date=November 2014 |pmid=25433518 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008324.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small amount of evidence that skipping a night's sleep may improve depressive symptoms, with the effects usually showing up within a day. This effect is usually temporary.

====Cognitive behavioral therapy====
{{See also|Behavioral theories of depression}}

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression.&lt;ref name=abct&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726055131/http://www.abct.org/sccap/?m=sPublic&amp;fa=pub_Depression Childhood Depression]. abct.org. Last updated: 30 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In people under 18, according to the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]], [[Interpersonal psychotherapy|interpersonal therapy]], or [[family therapy]].&lt;ref name=NICEkids5&gt;{{cite book |author=NICE |title=NICE guidelines: Depression in children and adolescents |publisher=NICE |location=London |year=2005 |page=5 |isbn=978-1-84629-074-9 |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG28/QuickRefGuide/pdf/English |access-date=16 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924152314/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG28/QuickRefGuide/pdf/English |archive-date=24 September 2008  |author-link=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to reduce the number of sick days taken by people with depression, when used in conjunction with primary care.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. Research beginning in the mid-1990s suggested that CBT could perform as well as or better than antidepressants in people with moderate to severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dobson KS |title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of cognitive therapy for depression |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=414–19 |date=June 1989 |pmid=2738214 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.57.3.414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RothFonagy78&gt;{{cite book |title=What Works for Whom?

Cognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Variants====
Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being [[rational emotive behavior therapy]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb |Beck|1987|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid18085916"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coelho HF, Canter PH, Ernst E |title=Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: evaluating current evidence and informing future research |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1000–05 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18085916 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.75.6.1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms.&lt;ref name=Khoury&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khoury B, Lecomte T, Fortin G, Masse M, Therien P, Bouchard V, Chapleau MA, Paquin K, Hofmann SG |title=Mindfulness-based therapy: a comprehensive meta-analysis |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=763–71 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23796855 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain FA, Walsh RN, Eisendrath SJ, Christensen S, Rael Cahn B |title=Critical analysis of the efficacy of meditation therapies for acute and subacute phase treatment of depressive disorders: a systematic review |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=140–52 |date=2014 |pmid=25591492 |pmc=4383597 |doi=10.1016/j.psym.2014.10.007 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0372c9xp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth.&lt;ref name=Simkin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simkin DR, Black NB |title=Meditation and mindfulness in clinical practice |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=487–534 |date=July 2014 |pmid=24975623 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2014.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
[[Psychoanalysis]] is a school of thought, founded by [[Sigmund Freud]], which emphasizes the resolution of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] mental conflicts.&lt;ref name="isbn0-314-20412-1"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Dworetzky J |title=Psychology |publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub.

===Antidepressants===
[[File:Zoloft bottles.jpg|thumb|[[Sertraline]] (Zoloft) is used primarily to treat major depression in adults.]]
Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iglesias-González M, Aznar-Lou I, Gil-Girbau M, Moreno-Peral P, Peñarrubia-María MT, Rubio-Valera M, Serrano-Blanco A | title = Comparing watchful waiting with antidepressants for the management of subclinical depression symptoms to mild-moderate depression in primary care: a systematic review | journal = Family Practice | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 639–48 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28985309 | doi = 10.1093/fampra/cmx054 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic ([[dysthymia]]) or severe.

While small benefits were found, researchers [[Irving Kirsch]] and [[Thomas Moore (spiritual writer)|Thomas Moore]] state they may be due to issues with the trials rather than a true effect of the medication.&lt;ref name="administration2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |vauthors=Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment |year=2002 |volume=5 |doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for [[clinical significance]].&lt;ref name=Kir2008 /&gt; Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis by Fornier.&lt;ref name=Fou2010 /&gt;

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), such as [[escitalopram]], [[paroxetine]], and [[sertraline]], have greater efficacy than [[placebo]] on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression.&lt;ref name="Depression in Adults"&gt;{{cite web|title=The treatment and management of depression in adults|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/resources/guidance-depression-in-adults-pdf|publisher=[[NICE]]|date=October 2009|access-date=12 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112140520/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/resources/guidance-depression-in-adults-pdf|archive-date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic [[tricyclic antidepressant]] [[amitriptyline]] concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leucht C, Huhn M, Leucht S |title=Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=12 |pages=CD009138 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23235671 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 |editor1-last=Leucht |editor1-first=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 Cochrane review on the combined use of antidepressants plus [[benzodiazepine]]s demonstrated improved effectiveness when compared to antidepressants alone; however, these effects were not maintained in the acute or continuous phase.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogawa Y, Takeshima N, Hayasaka Y, Tajika A, Watanabe N, Streiner D, Furukawa TA | title = Antidepressants plus benzodiazepines for adults with major depression | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 6 | pages = CD001026 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31158298 | pmc = 6546439 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001026.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of adding a benzodiazepine should be balanced against possible harms and other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant mono-therapy is considered inadequate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2014 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.&lt;ref name=Fou2010 /&gt;

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50 to 75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to improvement.&lt;ref name=apaguidelines /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Vries YA, Roest AM, Bos EH, Burgerhof JG, van Loo HM, de Jonge P | title = Predicting antidepressant response by monitoring early improvement of individual symptoms of depression: individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 214 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–10 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 29952277 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.2018.122 | pmc = 7557872 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,&lt;!--This study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?--&gt;&lt;ref name=apaguidelines&gt;{{cite journal | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (revision).

There is significant agreement between the three sets of recommendations."&lt;/ref&gt;

These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some people receive maintenance ECT.&lt;ref name=FDA2011rev /&gt;

[[Transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS) is another noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain with the help of a weak electric current. Increasing evidence has been gathered for its efficiency as a depression treatment. A meta-analysis was published in 2020 summarising results across nine studies (572 participants) concluded that active tDCS was significantly superior to sham for response (30.9% vs. 18.9%, respectively), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%) and depression improvement.&lt;ref name="Moffa 109836"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moffa AH, Martin D, Alonzo A, et al | title = Efficacy and acceptability of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for major depressive disorder: An individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry | volume = 99 | pages = 109836 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 31837388 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109836 | s2cid = 209373871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2016 meta analysis,&amp;nbsp;34% of people treated with tDCS showed at least 50% symptom reduction compared to 19% sham-treated across 6 randomised controlled trials.&lt;ref name="Brunoni 522–531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunoni AR, Moffa AH, Fregni F, et al | title = Transcranial direct current stimulation for acute major depressive episodes: meta-analysis of individual patient data | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 208 | issue = 6 | pages = 522–31 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27056623 | pmc = 4887722 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.115.164715 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light therapy===
Bright [[light therapy]] reduces depression symptom severity, with benefit for both [[seasonal affective disorder]] and for nonseasonal depression, and an effect similar to those for conventional antidepressants. For nonseasonal depression, adding light therapy to the standard antidepressant treatment was not effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Golden RN, Gaynes BN, Ekstrom RD, Hamer RM, Jacobsen FM, Suppes T, Wisner KL, Nemeroff CB |title=The efficacy of light therapy in the treatment of mood disorders: a review and meta-analysis of the evidence |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=656–62 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15800134 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.4.656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For nonseasonal depression, where light was used mostly in combination with antidepressants or [[wake therapy]], a moderate effect was found, with response better than control treatment in high-quality studies, in studies that applied morning light treatment, and with people who respond to total or partial [[sleep deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuunainen A, Kripke DF, Endo T |title=Light therapy for non-seasonal depression |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |page=CD004050 |year=2004 |pmid=15106233 |pmc=6669243 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004050.pub2 |editor1-last=Tuunainen |editor1-first=Arja }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both analyses noted poor quality, short duration, and small size of most of the reviewed studies.

==Prognosis==
Studies have shown that 80% of those suffering from their first major depressive episode will have at least one more depression during their life,&lt;ref name="pmid17144786"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fava GA, Park SK, Sonino N |title=Treatment of recurrent depression |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1735–40 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17144786 |doi=10.1586/14737175.6.11.1735 |s2cid=22808803 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a lifetime average of 4 episodes.&lt;ref name="pmid17555914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Limosin F, Mekaoui L, Hautecouverture S |title=[Prophylactic treatment for recurrent major depression] |journal=Presse Médicale |volume=36 |issue=11 Pt 2 |pages=1627–33 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17555914 |doi=10.1016/j.lpm.2007.03.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other general population studies indicate that around half those who have an episode recover (whether treated or not) and remain well, while the other half will have at least one more, and around 15% of those experience chronic recurrence.&lt;ref name="pmid18458203"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eaton WW, Shao H, Nestadt G, Lee HB, Lee BH, Bienvenu OJ, Zandi P |title=Population-based study of first onset and chronicity in major depressive disorder |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=513–20 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18458203 |pmc=2761826 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.5.513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies recruiting from selective inpatient sources suggest lower recovery and higher chronicity, while studies of mostly outpatients show that nearly all recover, with a median episode duration of 11 months. Around 90% of those with severe or psychotic depression, most of whom also meet criteria for other mental disorders, experience recurrence.&lt;ref name="pmid18251627"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holma KM, Holma IA, Melartin TK, Rytsälä HJ, Isometsä ET |title=Long-term outcome of major depressive disorder in psychiatric patients is variable |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=196–205 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18251627 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v69n0205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12877398"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanai T, Takeuchi H, Furukawa TA, Yoshimura R, Imaizumi T, Kitamura T, Takahashi K |title=Time to recurrence after recovery from major depressive episodes and its predictors |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=839–45 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12877398 |doi=10.1017/S0033291703007827 |s2cid=10490348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high proportion of people who experience full symptomatic remission still have at least one not fully resolved symptom after treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Culpepper L, Muskin PR, Stahl SM | title = Major Depressive Disorder: Understanding the Significance of Residual Symptoms and Balancing Efficacy with Tolerability | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 128 | issue = 9 Suppl | pages = S1–S15 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26337210 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.07.001 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurrence or chronicity is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six&amp;nbsp;months after remission to prevent relapse. Evidence from many [[randomized controlled trial]]s indicate continuing antidepressant medications after recovery can reduce the chance of relapse by 70% (41% on placebo vs. 18% on antidepressant). The preventive effect probably lasts for at least the first 36&amp;nbsp;months of use.&lt;ref name="pmid12606176"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C, Furukawa TA, Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Goodwin GM | title = Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: a systematic review | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9358 | pages = 653–61 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12606176 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 | s2cid = 20198748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People experiencing repeated episodes of depression require ongoing treatment in order to prevent more severe, long-term depression. In some cases, people must take medications for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000945.htm|title=Major Depression|website=MedlinePlus|date=10 March 2014|access-date=16 July 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707122024/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000945.htm|archive-date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases when outcome is poor are associated with inappropriate treatment, severe initial symptoms including psychosis, early age of onset, previous episodes, incomplete recovery after one year of treatment, pre-existing severe mental or medical disorder, and [[family dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/depression-major/prognosis|title=Depression, Major: Prognosis|website=MDGuidelines|publisher=[[The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America]]|access-date=16 July 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420055044/http://www.mdguidelines.com/depression-major/prognosis|archive-date=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major depression is currently the leading cause of [[disease burden]] in North America and other high-income countries, and the fourth-leading cause worldwide. In the year 2030, it is predicted to be the second-leading cause of disease burden worldwide after [[HIV]], according to the WHO.&lt;ref name="pmid17132052"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathers CD, Loncar D |title=Projections of global mortality and burden of disease from 2002 to 2030 |journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=11 |page=e442 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17132052 |pmc=1664601 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delay or failure in seeking treatment after relapse and the failure of health professionals to provide treatment are two barriers to reducing disability.&lt;ref name=Andrews08&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andrews G |title=Reducing the burden of depression |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=420–27 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18674396 |doi=10.1177/070674370805300703|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Untreated depression===
Major depressive episodes often resolve over time whether or not they are treated. Outpatients on a waiting list show a 10–15% reduction in symptoms within a few months, with approximately 20% no longer meeting the full criteria for a depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Posternak MA, Miller I |title=Untreated short-term course of major depression: a meta-analysis of outcomes from studies using wait-list control groups |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=66 |issue=2–3 |pages=139–46 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11578666 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00304-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[median]] duration of an episode has been estimated to be 23 weeks, with the highest rate of recovery in the first three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Posternak MA, Solomon DA, Leon AC, Mueller TI, Shea MT, Endicott J, Keller MB |title=The naturalistic course of unipolar major depression in the absence of somatic therapy |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=194 |issue=5 |pages=324–29 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16699380 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000217820.33841.53 |s2cid=22891687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 review, 23% of untreated adults suffering from mild to moderate depression will remit within 3 months, 32% within 6 months and 53% within 12 months.&lt;ref name="Whiteford Harris McKeon Baxter 2013 pp. 1569–1585"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whiteford | first1=H.

===Ability to work===
Depression may affect people's ability to work. The combination of usual clinical care and support with return to work (like working less hours or changing tasks) probably reduces sick leave by 15%, and leads to fewer depressive symptoms and improved work capacity, reducing sick leave by an annual average of 25 days per year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieuwenhuijsen K, Verbeek JH, Neumeyer-Gromen A, Verhoeven AC, Bültmann U, Faber B |title=Interventions to improve return to work in depressed people |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=10 |issue= 12|pages=CD006237 |date=October 2020 |pmid=33052607 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006237.pub4 |pmc=8094165 |url=|pmc-embargo-date=October 14, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helping depressed people return to work without a connection to clinical care has not been shown to have an effect on sick leave days. Additional psychological interventions (such as online cognitive behavioral therapy) leads to fewer sick days compared to standard management only. Streamlining care or adding specific providers for depression care may help to reduce sick leave.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Life expectancy and the risk of suicide===
Depressed individuals have a shorter [[life expectancy]] than those without depression, in part because people who are depressed are at risk of dying of suicide.&lt;ref name="pmid12377293"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassano P, Fava M |title=Depression and public health: an overview |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=849–57 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12377293 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00304-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have a higher [[mortality rate|rate of dying]] from other causes,&lt;ref name="pmid17640152"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rush AJ |title=The varied clinical presentations of major depressive disorder |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=68 Suppl 8 |issue=Supplement 8 |pages=4–10 |year=2007 |pmid=17640152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being more susceptible to medical conditions such as heart disease.&lt;ref name="pmid18334889" /&gt; Up to 60% of people who die of suicide have a mood disorder such as major depression, and the risk is especially high if a person has a marked sense of hopelessness or has both depression and [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=Bar2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Barlow DH, Durand VM |title=Abnormal psychology: An integrative approach (5th ed.) |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-534-63356-1|pages=248–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2–8% of adults with major depression die by [[suicide]],&lt;ref name=Rich2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=C.

==History==
{{Main|History of depression}}

The Ancient Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] described a syndrome of [[melancholia]] as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of the ailment.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23&lt;/ref&gt; It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.&lt;ref name="Radden2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Radden J |year=2003 |title=Is this dame melancholy?

[[File:Hippocrates pushkin02.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|Diagnoses of depression go back at least as far as [[Hippocrates]].]]
The term ''depression'' itself was derived from the Latin verb ''deprimere'', "to press down".&lt;ref&gt;depress. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved 30 June 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203095346/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author [[Richard Baker (chronicler)|Richard Baker's]] ''Chronicle'' to refer to someone having "a great depression of spirit", and by English author [[Samuel Johnson's health|Samuel Johnson]] in a similar sense in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Wolpert L|year=1999|title=Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression|website=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|access-date=30 October 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409111218/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|archive-date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also came into use in [[depression (physiology)|physiology]] and [[depression (economics)|economics]]. An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist [[Louis Delasiauve]] in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function.&lt;ref name="pmid3074848"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berrios GE |title=Melancholia and depression during the 19th century: a conceptual history |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=298–304 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3074848 |doi=10.1192/bjp.153.3.298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aristotle]], melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity. The newer concept abandoned these associations and through the 19th century, became more associated with women.&lt;ref name="Radden2003" /&gt;

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.&lt;ref name="Davison2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively but the ego itself is compromised.&lt;ref name="Carhart-Harris08"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carhart-Harris RL, Mayberg HS, Malizia AL, Nutt D |title=Mourning and melancholia revisited: correspondences between principles of Freudian metapsychology and empirical findings in neuropsychiatry |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |volume=7 |page=9 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18652673 |pmc=2515304 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-7-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The person's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Richards A |vauthors=Freud S |title=11.

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schildkraut JJ |title=The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=509–22 |date=November 1965 |pmid=5319766 |doi=10.1176/ajp.122.5.509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical imbalance theory has never been proven.&lt;ref name="Paris2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paris J |title=The mistreatment of major depressive disorder |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=148–51 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24881163 |pmc=4079242 |doi=10.1177/070674371405900306 |type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''unipolar'' (along with the related term ''[[bipolar disorder|bipolar]]'') was coined by the neurologist and psychiatrist [[Karl Kleist]], and subsequently used by his disciples [[Edda Neele]] and [[Karl Leonhard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jules Angst|Angst J.]] Terminology, history and definition of bipolar spectrum.

The term ''Major depressive disorder'' was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s as part of proposals for diagnostic criteria based on patterns of symptoms (called the "Research Diagnostic Criteria", building on earlier [[Feighner Criteria]]),&lt;ref name= Spitzer/&gt; and was incorporated into the DSM-III in 1980.&lt;ref name="Philipp1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philipp M, Maier W, Delmo CD |title=The concept of major depression.

==Society and culture==

===Terminology===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-60 by Brady, 1862.jpg|thumb|The 16th [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] had "[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]", a condition that now may be referred to as clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Joshua [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression "Lincoln's Great Depression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |date=9 October 2011 }}, ''The Atlantic'', October 2005, Retrieved 10 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term "depression" is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other [[mood disorder]]s or simply to a low mood. People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. "Because of the lack of scientific certainty," one commentator has observed, "the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129377|title=The Depression Wars: Would Honest Abe Have Written the Gettysburg Address on Prozac?|author=Maloney F|date=3 November 2005|journal=Slate|access-date=3 October 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925012423/http://www.slate.com/id/2129377/|archive-date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.&lt;ref name="Karasz05"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karasz A |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15652693 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Tilbury F, Rapley M | year = 2004 | title = 'There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=54–64|doi=10.5172/hesr.13.1.54| s2cid = 145545714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as China. It has been argued that the Chinese traditionally deny or [[Somatization|somatize]] emotional depression (although since the early 1980s, the Chinese denial of depression may have modified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker G, Gladstone G, Chee KT |title=Depression in the planet's largest ethnic group: the Chinese |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=857–64 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11384889 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.6.857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status.

===Stigma===
Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings, or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression. People who may have had depression include English author [[Mary Shelley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seymour|first=Miranda |name-list-style=vanc |title=Mary Shelley|publisher=Grove Press|year=2002 |pages=560–61 |isbn=978-0-8021-3948-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; American-British writer [[Henry James]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/americancollection/american/genius/henry_bio.html|title=Biography of Henry James|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|pbs.org]]|access-date=19 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008042925/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/americancollection/american/genius/henry_bio.html|archive-date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American president [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burlingame |first=Michael |name-list-style=vanc |title=The Inner World of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-252-06667-2 |pages=xvii, 92–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known contemporary people with possible depression include Canadian songwriter [[Leonard Cohen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pita E |url=http://www.webheights.net/10newsongs/press/elmunmag.htm |title=An Intimate Conversation with...Leonard Cohen |date=26 September 2001 |access-date=3 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011082500/http://www.webheights.net/10newsongs/press/elmunmag.htm |archive-date=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and American playwright and novelist [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref name="Jeste04"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeste ND, Palmer BW, Jeste DV |title=Tennessee Williams |journal=The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=370–75 |year=2004 |pmid=15249274 |doi=10.1097/00019442-200407000-00004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pioneering psychologists, such as Americans [[William James]]&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=James H |title=Letters of William James (Vols. 1 and 2) |publisher=Kessinger Publishing Co|location=Montana  |pages=147–48|isbn=978-0-7661-7566-2 |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HistoryJames"&gt;{{Harvnb |Hergenhahn|2005|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John B.

Social stigma of major depression is widespread, and contact with mental health services reduces this only slightly.

Depression is especially common among those over 65 years of age and increases in frequency beyond this age.&lt;ref name="SBU"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/depression-treatment-for-the-elderly/|title=Depression treatment for the elderly | author = [[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU) |website=www.sbu.se|access-date=16 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618011954/http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/depression-treatment-for-the-elderly/|archive-date=18 June 2016|date=27 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the risk of depression increases in relation to the frailty of the individual.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Depression is one of the most important factors which negatively impact quality of life in adults, as well as the elderly.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Both symptoms and treatment among the elderly differ from those of the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

As with many other diseases, it is common among the elderly not to present with classical depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs, and often have other concurrent diseases.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; Treatment differs in that studies of SSRIs have shown lesser and often inadequate effects among the elderly, while other drugs, such as [[duloxetine]] (a [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]), with more clear effects have adverse effects, such as dizziness, dryness of the mouth, diarrhea and constipation, which can be especially difficult to handle among the elderly.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

[[Problem solving therapy]] was, as of 2015, the only psychological therapy with proven effect, and can be likened to a simpler form of cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; However, elderly with depression are seldom offered any psychological treatment, and the evidence proving other treatments effective is incomplete.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt; ECT has been used in the elderly, and register-studies suggest it is effective, although less so as compared to the rest of the population. The risks involved with treatment of depression among the elderly as opposed to benefits are not entirely clear.&lt;ref name="SBU" /&gt;

==Research==
[[MRI]] scans of people with depression have revealed a number of differences in brain structure compared to those who are not depressed. Meta-analyses of [[neuroimaging]] studies in major depression reported that, compared to controls, people who are depressed had increased volume of the [[lateral ventricles]] and [[adrenal gland]] and smaller volumes of the [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[frontal lobe]] (including the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and [[gyrus rectus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempton MJ, Salvador Z, Munafò MR, Geddes JR, Simmons A, Frangou S, Williams SC |title=Structural neuroimaging studies in major depressive disorder.

Trials are looking at the effects of [[botulinum toxin]]s on depression.

===Animal models===
{{further|Animal models of depression|animal psychopathology#Depression}}

Models of depression in animals for the purpose of study include [[iatrogenic]] depression models (such as drug-induced), forced swim tests, [[tail suspension test]], and [[learned helplessness]] models. Criteria frequently used to assess depression in animals include expression of despair, neurovegetative changes, and anhedonia, as many other criteria for depression are untestable in animals, such as guilt and suicidality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Krishnan V, Nestler EJ |volume=7 |pages=121–47 |date=2011 |pmid=21225412 |pmc=3270071 |doi=10.1007/7854_2010_108 |isbn=978-3-642-19702-4 |series=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences |title=Molecular and Functional Models in Neuropsychiatry |chapter=Animal Models of Depression: Molecular Perspectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;
