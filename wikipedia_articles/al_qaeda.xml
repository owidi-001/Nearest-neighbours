Al-Qaeda operates as a network of [[Islamic extremist]]s and [[Salafi jihadism|Salafist jihadists]]. The organization has been designated as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[European Union]], the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and various other countries (see [[#Designation as a terrorist group|below]]). Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries, including the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], the [[September 11 attacks]], and the [[2002 Bali bombings]].&lt;ref name=dalacoura40/&gt;

The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the "[[War on Terror]]", which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies. The deaths of key leaders, including [[death of Osama bin Laden|that of Osama bin Laden]], have led al-Qaeda's operations to shift from top-down organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks which are carried out by a loose network of associated groups and [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf]] operators. Al-Qaeda characteristically organises attacks which include [[suicide attack]]s and the simultaneous bombing of several [[Target of opportunity|targets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=107–108, 185, 270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]].&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/al-qaidas-ideology.html|title=al Qaida's Ideology|publisher=MI5|access-date=May 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214557/http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/al-qaidas-ideology.html |archive-date=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21525400|title=Dreaming of a caliphate|date=August 6, 2011|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda members believe a [[Christianity and Judaism|Christian–Jewish]] alliance is [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiring]] to destroy [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Fu'ad Husayn 'Al-Zarqawi, "The Second Generation of al-Qa'ida, Part Fourteen," ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', July 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As Salafist jihadists, members of al-Qaeda believe that killing [[non-combatants]] is [[Social control|religiously sanctioned]]. Al-Qaeda also opposes what it regards as [[man-made law]]s, and wants to replace them with a strict form of [[sharia law]].&lt;ref name="LT246"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2006|p=[https://archive.org/details/loomingtoweralqa00wrig/page/246 246]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda has carried out many attacks on people whom it considers ''[[kafir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jihadi Terrorism and the Radicalisation Challenge: p.219, Rik Coolsaet{{snd}}2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is also responsible for instigating [[sectarian violence among Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Dragons and Tigers: A Geography of South, East, and Southeast Asia{{snd}}(2011){{snd}}Barbara A.

Following the [[Killing of Osama bin Laden|death]] of [[Osama bin Laden]] in 2011, the group has been led by Egyptian [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], and as of 2021 has reportedly suffered from a deterioration of central command over its regional operations.&lt;ref name="Zakaria-10-years-29-4-21"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zakaria |first1=Fareed |title=Opinion: Ten years later, Islamist terrorism isn't the threat it used to be |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/ten-years-later-islamist-terrorism-isnt-the-threat-it-used-to-be/2021/04/29/deb88256-a91c-11eb-bca5-048b2759a489_story.html |access-date=4 May 2021 |agency=Washington Post |date=29 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Al-Qaeda only indirectly controls its day-to-day operations. Its philosophy calls for the [[centralization]] of decision making, while allowing for the [[decentralization]] of execution.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hammadi, Khalid, "The Inside Story of al-Qa'ida", part 4, ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda's top leaders have defined the organization's ideology and guiding strategy, and they have also articulated simple and easy-to-receive messages. At the same time, mid-level organizations were given autonomy, but they had to consult with top management before large-scale attacks and assassinations. Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing. Through al-Qaeda's information committees, he placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Al Qaeda v ISIS: Leaders &amp; Structure {{!}} Wilson Center|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/al-qaeda-v-isis-leaders-structure|access-date=2021-03-03|website=www.wilsoncenter.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[War on Terror]], al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated. As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several al-Qaeda groups.&lt;ref&gt;J. Feiser – {{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html |title=Evolution of the al-Qaeda brand name |work=Asia Times |date=August 13, 2004 |access-date=March 22, 2010 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050423141837/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html |archive-date=April 23, 2005 |url-status=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf|title=The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism – Spring 2006|access-date=March 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623022648/http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf|archive-date=June 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda's leadership. However, bin Laden held considerable ideological sway over some [[Muslim extremists]] before his death. Experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements, and that these groups bear little connection with one another.&lt;ref name="FT Threat"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Blitz|first1=James|journal=Financial Times|title=A threat transformed|date=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af31e344-0499-11df-8603-00144feabdc0.html|access-date=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with [[Tayseer Allouni]]:

{{quote| this matter isn't about any specific person and{{nbs}}... is not about the al-Qa'idah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one{{nbs}}... and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida{{nbs}}... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire{{nbs}}... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania{{nbs}}... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.&lt;ref name=islamicawakening&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=977&amp;pageID=64 |title=A Discussion on the New Crusader Wars: Tayseer Allouni with Usamah bin Laden |publisher=IslamicAwakening.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621142756/http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=977&amp;pageID=64 |archive-date=June 21, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Bruce Hoffman]], however, sees al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas.&lt;ref name="FT Threat"/&gt;

===Leadership===
====Osama bin Laden (1988 – May 2011)====

Bin Laden was advised by a [[shura|Shura Council]], which consists of senior al-Qaeda members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/al-qaeda-v-isis-leaders-structure|last1=Glenn|first1=Cameron|date=28 September 2015|title=Al Qaeda v ISIS: Leaders &amp; Structure|publisher=Wilson Center|access-date=5 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was estimated to consist of 20–30 people.

====After May 2011====
[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] had been al-Qaeda's deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin Laden's death. Al-Zawahiri replaced [[Saif al-Adel]], who had served as interim commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/06/16/world/middleeast/AP-ML-Al-Qaida-Zawahri.html|title=Al-Qaida Says Al-Zawahri Has Succeeded Bin Laden|agency=Associated Press|work=The New York Times |date=June 16, 2011|access-date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2012, Pakistani intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman's alleged successor as second in command, [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]], had been killed in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/world/asia/qaeda-deputy-killed-in-drone-strike-in-pakistan.html|title=Drone Strike Killed No. 2 in Al Qaeda, U.S. Officials Say|date=June 5, 2012|work=The New York Times|first1=Declan|last1=Walsh|first2=Eric|last2=Schmitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nasir al-Wuhayshi]] was alleged to have become al-Qaeda's overall second in command and general manager in 2013.

{{anchor|Committees}}&lt;!--linked from Abu-Zaid al Kuwaiti--&gt;Al-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network which drew upon the leadership of a number of regional nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization divided itself into several committees, which include:
* The Military Committee, which is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks.
* The Money/Business Committee, which funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the ''[[hawala]]'' banking system. US-led efforts to eradicate the sources of "[[terrorist financing]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|State 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Basile|2004|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so ''hawaladars'' in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to {{US$|10}}{{nbs}}million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wechsler|2001|p=135}}; cited in {{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also procures false passports, pays al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Businesses are run from below, with the council only being consulted on new proposals and collecting funds.&lt;br&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Hoffman|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'', it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30{{nbs}}million per year to conduct its operations.
* The Law Committee reviews [[Sharia law]], and decides upon courses of action conform to it.
* The Islamic Study/''[[Fatwā|Fatwah]]'' Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.
* The Media Committee ran the now-defunct newspaper ''Nashrat al Akhbar'' ({{lang-en|Newscast}}) and handled [[public relations]].
* In 2005, al-Qaeda formed [[As-Sahab]], a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials.

===Command structure===
Most of Al Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Al Qaeda|url=https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/al-qaeda|access-date=2021-03-03|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Al-Qaeda is not [[Military operation|operationally]] managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri. Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;C. Glenn – [https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/al-qaeda-v-isis-leaders-structure ''The Islamists'']. [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|The Wilson Centre]] September 28, 2015. Accessed June 15, 2017. "...{{nbs}}Zawahiri does not claim to have direct hierarchical control over al Qaeda's vast, networked structure. Al Qaeda's core leadership seeks to centralize the organization's messaging and strategy rather than to manage the daily operations of its franchises. But formal affiliates are required to consult with al Qaeda's core leadership before carrying out large-scale attacks."&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 2005 about the possibility of al-Qaeda's connection to the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]], [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] [[Sir Ian Blair]] said: "Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working{{nbs}}... but this has the hallmark of that approach{{nbs}}... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training{{nbs}}... to provide expertise{{nbs}}... and I think that is what has occurred here."&lt;ref name="foxnewsblair"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cops: London Attacks Were Homicide Blasts|date=July 15, 2005|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,162476,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=June 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420155421/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,162476,00.html|archive-date=April 20, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 2005, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, reported that the July{{nbs}}7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda mastermind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=London bombings: the truth emerges|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece|first1=Jason|last1=Bennetto|first2=Ian|last2=Herbert|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=August 13, 2005|access-date=December 3, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026100045/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece|archive-date=October 26, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser al-Bahri, who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for four years in the run-up to 9/11 wrote in his memoir a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time. Al-Bahri described al-Qaeda's formal administrative structure and vast arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bahri, Nasser, ''Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al-Qaeda''. p. 185. Thin Man Press. London. {{ISBN|9780956247360}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author [[Adam Curtis]] argued that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contended the name "al-Qaeda" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the [[1998 US embassy bombings]] in East Africa. Curtis wrote:

{{quote|The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term "al-Qaeda" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.&lt;ref name="The Power of Nightmares"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmares ''The Power of Nightmares''], BBC Documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 2001 trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]]. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of [[Jamal al-Fadl]], who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCloud|first1=Kimberly|title=WMD Terrorism and Usama bin Laden|url=http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm|work=CNS Reports|publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies|access-date=May 4, 2011|author2=Osborne, Matthew|date=March 7, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506145417/http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm|archive-date=May 6, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack US military establishments.&lt;ref name="first informant"&gt;{{Harvnb|McGeary|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/02/13/Embassy.bombings.trial/ |title=Witness: Bin Laden planned attack on U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia

{{quote|There were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.&lt;ref name="The Power of Nightmares"/&gt;}}

===Field operatives===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]] interviewing [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, 1997]]

The number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9243503/Secret-Osama-bin-Laden-files-reveal-al-Qaeda-membership.html Secret Osama bin Laden files reveal al Qaeda membership], ''The Telegraph'' accessed July 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cassidy|2006|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2009}}, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2211994/|title=The Terrorists-Are-Dumb Theory: Don't mistake these guys for criminal masterminds|first1=Timothy|last1=Noah|author-link=Timothy Noah|work=Slate|date=February 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227091408/http://www.slate.com/id/2211994/|archive-date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2004 BBC documentary ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gerges|first1=Fawaz A|title=The Far Enemy: Why Jihad Went Global|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=September 5, 2005|isbn=0-521-79140-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/farenemywhyjihad0000gerg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda's commanders, as well as its sleeping agents, are hiding in different parts of the world to this day. They are mainly hunted by the American and Israeli secret services. Al Qaeda's number two leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, was killed by Israeli agents. His pseudonym was Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in November 2020 in Iran. He was involved in the 1988 assassination attempt on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-11-15|title=Report: Israeli agents assassinated Al-Qaeda's No. 2 in Iran|url=https://www.jns.org/report-israeli-agents-assassinated-al-qaedas-no-2-in-iran/|access-date=2021-03-03|website=JNS.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurgent forces===
According to author Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was "organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces" in the Soviet–Afghan war.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt; The force was composed primarily of foreign ''mujahideen'' from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global ''jihad''. Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt;

Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as being "predominantly Arab" in its first years of operation, but that the organization also includes "other peoples" {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/1710 Jihad's New Leaders] by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Kyle Dabruzzi, ''Middle East Quarterly'', Summer 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 62 percent of al-Qaeda members have a university education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c841b52c-b2e7-4e41-b27e-33d10245b935&amp;k=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120758/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c841b52c-b2e7-4e41-b27e-33d10245b935&amp;k=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2007|title=Today's jihadists: educated, wealthy and bent on killing?|publisher=Canada.com|date=July 3, 2007|access-date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and the following year, the Americans successfully settled accounts with Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, the organization's chief propagandist, and Abu Yahya al-Libi's deputy commander. The optimistic voices were already saying it was over for al-Qaeda. Nevertheless, it was around this time that the Arab Spring greeted the region, the turmoil of which came great to al-Qaeda's regional forces. Seven years later, Ayman al-Zawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization, implementing his strategy with systematic consistency. Tens of thousands loyal to al-Qaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia alike. In fact, from Northwest Africa to South Asia, al-Qaeda had more than two dozen “franchise-based” allies. The number of al-Qaeda militants was set at 20,000 in Syria alone, and they had 4,000 members in Yemen and about 7,000 in Somalia. The war was not over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Al-Qaeda's Resurrection|url=https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/al-qaedas-resurrection|access-date=2021-03-03|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===

Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Eichenwald|first1=Kurt|author-link=Kurt Eichenwald|title=A Nation Challenged: The Money; Terror Money Hard to Block, Officials Find|work=The New York Times|date=December 10, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/10/world/a-nation-challenged-the-money-terror-money-hard-to-block-officials-find.html|access-date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name="Forbes_May_5_2011"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2001/09/14/0914whoisobl.html Who is Bin Laden?].

Among the first pieces of evidence regarding Saudi Arabia's support for al-Qaeda was the so-called "[[The Golden Chain|Golden Chain]]", a list of early al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in Sarajevo by Bosnian police.&lt;ref name="history commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/searchResults.jsp?searchtext=al-qaeda%20saudi%20arabia&amp;events=on&amp;entities=on&amp;articles=on&amp;topics=on&amp;timelines=on&amp;projects=on&amp;titles=on&amp;descriptions=on&amp;dosearch=on&amp;search=Go|title=History Commons|access-date=June 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805191322/http://www.historycommons.org/searchResults.jsp?searchtext=al-qaeda%20saudi%20arabia&amp;events=on&amp;entities=on&amp;articles=on&amp;topics=on&amp;timelines=on&amp;projects=on&amp;titles=on&amp;descriptions=on&amp;dosearch=on&amp;search=Go|archive-date=August 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand-written list was validated by al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, and included the names of both donors and beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_v._Usama_bin_Laden/Day_2_6_February_2001 United States of America v.

Batterjee was designated as a terror financier by the US Department of the Treasury in 2004, and Julaidan is recognized as one of al-Qaeda's founders.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;

Documents seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid showed that al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB104794563734573400|title=List of Early al Qaeda Donors Points to Saudi Elite, Charities|first1=Glenn R. |last1=Simpson|date=March 19, 2003|access-date=June 21, 2016|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this activity exploited the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL). The IIRO had ties with al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including al-Qaeda's deputy Ayman al Zawahiri. Zawahiri's brother worked for the IIRO in Albania and had actively recruited on behalf of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="steve emerson"&gt;Emerson, Steve (2006). ''Jihad Incorporated: A Guide to Militant Islam in the US''.

====Allegations of Qatari support====

{{See also|Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis}}
Several Qatari citizens have been accused of funding al-Qaeda. This includes [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi]], a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) [[Alkarama]]. On December 18, 2013, the [[US Treasury]] designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="treasury press"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2249.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Al-Qa'ida Supporters in Qatar and Yemen|access-date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Treasury has said Nuaimi "has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qaeda in [[Iraq]] and Qatar-based donors".&lt;ref name="treasury press" /&gt;

Another Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a "Gulf-based al-Qaeda financier". Subayi's name was added to the [[UN Security Council]]'s Sanctions List in 2008 on charges of providing financial and material support to al-Qaeda senior leadership.&lt;ref name="fiscal times qatar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un press"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11790.doc.htm|title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee Amends One Entry on Its Sanctions List – Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|access-date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subayi allegedly moved al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia-based training camps.&lt;ref name="fiscal times qatar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un press" /&gt; He also financially supported Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani national and senior al-Qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attack according to the [[September 11 Commission]] report.&lt;ref name="9-11commission.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission Report&lt;!--bot generated title--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qataris provided support to al-Qaeda through the country's largest NGO, the [[Qatar Charity]]. Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity's director, was affiliated to al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the [[National Islamic Front]], a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in [[Sudan]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Legal proceedings from the trial ''United States vs. Enaam M. Arnaout'' revealed that [[Qatar]] Charity was cited by [[Bin Laden]] in 1993 as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al-Qaeda operatives overseas. The same documents also report Bin Laden's complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of before 1995.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

It is alleged{{who|date=January 2019}} that the Qatar Charity gave financial support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya.

On March 11, 2005, ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'' published extracts from [[Saif al-Adel]]'s document "Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020".&lt;ref name=Atwan&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/secrethistoryofa0000atwa |url-access=registration |first1=Abdel Bari |last1=Atwan |title=The Secret History of Al Qaeda |page=[https://archive.org/details/secrethistoryofa0000atwa/page/221 221] |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-24974-7 |via=Internet Archive |date=March 11, 2005 |access-date=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnewstt_news&amp;#93;=181&amp;tx_ttnewsbackPid&amp;#93;=238&amp;no_cache=1|title=single – The Jamestown Foundation|access-date=April 12, 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the [[Ummah]] from all forms of oppression:
# Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.
# Incite local resistance to occupying forces.
# Expand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.
# Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], but which did not have the same effect with the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]].
# The US economy will finally collapse by the year 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places. This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability. This will lead to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda, and a [[Wahhabi]] [[Caliphate]] will then be installed across the world.

Atwan noted that, while the plan is unrealistic, "it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|downfall of the Soviet Union]]."&lt;ref name=Atwan/&gt;

According to [[Fouad Hussein]], a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020. These phases include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Musharbash|first1=Yassir|title=The Future of Terrorism: What al-Qaida Really Wants|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html|access-date=January 15, 2015|work=Der Spiegel|date=August 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The Awakening." This phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003. The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack that kills many civilians on US soil.
# "Opening Eyes." This phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006. The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al-Qaeda group into a movement. Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.
# "Arising and Standing up", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010. In this phase, al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria. Hussein believed other countries in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] were also in danger.
# Al-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula. The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and [[cyberterrorism]], targeting the US economy and military infrastructure.
# The declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016. In this phase, al-Qaeda expected the resistance from Israel to be heavily reduced.
# The declaration of an "Islamic Army" and a "fight between believers and non-believers", also called "total confrontation".
# "Definitive Victory", projected to be completed by 2020.

According to the seven-phase strategy, the war is projected to last less than two years.

According to Charles Lister of the [[Middle East Institute]] and Katherine Zimmerman of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the new model of al-Qaeda is to "socialize communities" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35967409 BBC] April 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The English name of the organization is a simplified [[Romanization of Arabic|transliteration]] of the Arabic noun ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qāʿidah}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|القاعدة}}), which means "the foundation" or "the base". The initial ''al-'' is the Arabic [[definite article]] "the", hence "the base".&lt;ref&gt;Arabic Computer Dictionary: English-Arabic, Arabic-English By Ernest Kay, Multi-lingual International Publishers, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arabic, ''al-Qaeda'' has four syllables ({{IPA|/alˈqaː.ʕi.da/}}).&lt;!--This is a phonemic transcription that differs somewhat from the transcription system described at [[Help:IPA for Arabic]].--&gt; However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name are not [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] found in the English language, the common naturalized [[English phonology|English pronunciations]] include {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|aɪ|d|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|eɪ|d|ə}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|k|ɑː|ˈ|iː|d|ə}}. Al-Qaeda's name can also be [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''al-Qaida'', ''al-Qa'ida'', or ''el-Qaida''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra |title=Listen to the U.S. pronunciation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211020849/http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra |archive-date=December 11, 2005 |format=[[RealPlayer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with [[Al Jazeera]] journalist [[Tayseer Alouni]] in October 2001:
{{quote|The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late [[Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri|Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri]] established the training camps for our ''mujahedeen'' against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html|title=Transcript of Bin Laden's October interview|publisher=CNN|date=February 5, 2002|access-date=October 22, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206081331/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html|archive-date=December 6, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been argued that two documents seized from the [[Sarajevo]] office of the [[Benevolence International Foundation]] prove the name was not simply adopted by the ''mujahideen'' movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term "al-Qaeda".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|p=75}}. Wright indirectly quotes one of the documents, based on an exhibit from the "Tareek Osama" document presented in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/bif/usarnaout10603prof.pdf ''United States v.

Former British Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as "the database", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of ''mujahideen'' militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Robin|last1=Cook|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development|title=Robin Cook: The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=July 8, 2005|access-date=May 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514051125/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development|archive-date=May 14, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2002, the group assumed the name ''Qa'idat al-Jihad'' ({{lang|ar|قاعدة الجهاد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qāʿidat al-jihād}}''), which means "the base of Jihad". According to [[Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies|Diaa Rashwan]], this was "apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|al-Jihad]], which was led by [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/op13.htm After Mombassa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514233523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/op13.htm |date=May 14, 2013 }}", ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly|Al-Ahram Weekly Online]]'', January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619).

==Ideology==
{{See also|Qutbism}}
{{Islamism sidebar}}
[[File:Sayyid Qutb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sayyid Qutb]], the Egyptian Islamist who inspired al-Qaeda]]

The radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement developed during the [[Islamic revival]] and the rise of the [[Islamism|Islamist movement]] after the [[Iranian Revolution]] (1978-1979).

Some have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker [[Sayyid Qutb]] inspired the al-Qaeda organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of ''[[sharia]]'' law, the [[Muslim world]] was no longer [[Muslim]], and had reverted to the pre-Islamic ignorance known as ''[[jahiliyyah]]''. To restore Islam, Qutb argued that a vanguard of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish "true [[Islamic state (government)|Islamic states]]", implement ''sharia'', and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences. In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included "[[Jews|world Jewry]]", which "plotted [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitism|conspiracies]]" and opposed Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Qutb|2003|pp=63, 69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], a close college friend of bin Laden: {{quote|Islam is different from any other [[religion]]; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Qutb also influenced bin Laden's mentor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/qutb_milest_influence_obl.html|title=How Did Sayyid Qutb Influence Osama bin Laden?|publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com|access-date=March 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017060150/http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/qutb_milest_influence_obl.html|archive-date=October 17, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, protégé, personal lawyer, and an executor of his estate. Azzam was one of the last people to see Qutb alive before his execution.&lt;ref&gt;Mafouz Azzam; cited in {{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work ''Knights under the Prophet's Banner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/milestones_qutb.html#footnote_24|title=Sayyid Qutb's Milestones (footnote 24)|publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com|access-date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qutb argued that many Muslims were not true Muslims. Some Muslims, Qutb argued, were [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]]. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce ''sharia'' law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |title=Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism |first1=DALE C. |last1=EIKMEIER |work=Parameters |date=Spring 2007 |pages=85–98 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609120804/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |archive-date=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afghan Arabs|Afghan jihad]] against the pro-Soviet government further developed the [[Salafi jihadism|Salafist Jihadist]] movement which inspired Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0 |url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press.|ref=GKJTPI2002|isbn=9780674010901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious compatibility==
[[Abdel Bari Atwan]] wrote that:
{{quote|While the leadership's own theological platform is essentially Salafi, the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings. Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with [[Wahhabism]], [[Shafi'i]]sm, [[Maliki]]sm, and [[Hanafi]]sm. There are even some Al-Qaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as [[Mohammad Yunus Khalis|Yunis Khalis]], one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin. He was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings{{snd}}practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought. The only exception to this pan-Islamic policy is [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]]. Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy. In Iraq it has openly declared war on the Badr Brigades, who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.&lt;ref name=AbdelBariAtwan&gt;Abdel Bari Atwan. ''The Secret History of Al Qaeda'', p. 233. University of California Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-520-24974-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attacks on civilians===
Following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by Islamic scholars, Al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, "A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington". According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides "ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation."&lt;ref name="Wiktorowicz-2003-86"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiktorowicz |first1=Quintan |last2=Kaltner |first2=John |title=KILLING IN THE NAME OF ISLAM: AL-QAEDA'S JUSTIFICATION FOR SEPTEMBER 11 |journal=Middle East Policy |date=Summer 2003 |volume=X |issue=2 |pages=86|url=https://www.aclu.org/files/fbimappingfoia/20111110/ACLURM001177.pdf |access-date=12 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these justifications are that America is leading the west in waging a [[War against Islam conspiracy theory|War on Islam]] so that attacks on America are a defense of Islam and any treaties and agreements between Muslim majority states and Western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void. According to the tract, several conditions allow for the killing of civilians including:
* retaliation for the American war on Islam which al-Qaeda alleges has targeted "Muslim women, children and elderly";
* when it is too difficult to distinguish between non-combatants and combatants when attacking an enemy "stronghold" (''hist'') and/or non-combatants remain in enemy territory, killing them is allowed;
* those who assist the enemy "in deed, word, mind" are eligible for killing, and this includes the general population in democratic countries because civilians can vote in elections that bring enemies of Islam to power;
* the necessity of killing in the war to protect Islam and Muslims;
* the prophet Muhammad, when asked whether the Muslim fighters could use the catapult against the village of [[Ta'if#7th century: Era of Muhammad|Taif]], replied affirmatively, even though the enemy fighters were mixed with a civilian population;
* if the women, children and other protected groups serve as human shields for the enemy;
* if the enemy has broken a treaty, killing of civilians is permitted.&lt;ref name="Wiktorowicz-2003-86"/&gt;

==History==
''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: its beginnings in the late 1980s, a "wilderness" period in 1990–1996, its "heyday" in 1996–2001, a network period from 2001 to 2005, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Jason|last1=Burke|first2=Paddy|last2=Allen|name-list-style=amp|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/sep/10/al-qaida-five-ages-terror-attacks|title=The five ages of al-Qaida|work=The Guardian|location=UK|access-date=March 22, 2010|date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jihad in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Soviet–Afghan War|Jihadism}}
[[File:Afghan Muja crossing from Saohol Sar pass in Durand border region of Pakistan, August 1985.png|thumb|[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-funded and [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]-trained Afghan [[mujahideen]] fighters crossing the [[Durand Line]] border to fight Soviet forces and the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] in 1985]]

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet War in Afghanistan]] (December 1979{{snd}}February 1989).&lt;ref name="AntiSoviet"/&gt; The [[United States]] viewed the conflict in Afghanistan in terms of the [[Cold War]], with [[Marxist]]s on one side and the native Afghan ''mujahideen'' on the other. This view led to a [[CIA]] program called [[Operation Cyclone]], which channeled funds through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency to the Afghan Mujahideen.&lt;ref name="1986-1992-CIA-AND-BRITISH-RECRUIT-AND-TRAIN-MILITANTS-WORLDWIDE-TO-HELP-FIGHT-AFGHAN-WAR"&gt;{{cite web|title=1986–1992: CIA and British Recruit and Train Militants Worldwide to Help Fight Afghan War|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a86operationcyclone|publisher=Cooperative Research History Commons|access-date=January 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818210324/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a86operationcyclone|archive-date=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government provided substantial financial support to the Afghan Islamic militants. Aid to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], an Afghan ''mujahideen'' leader and founder of the [[Hezb-e Islami]], amounted to more than $600{{nbs}}million. In addition to American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of Saudi aid.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: inside the secret world of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, 2001. pp. 68–x69&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, after the US had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar "worked closely" with bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, 2001., pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a growing number of Arab ''mujahideen'' joined the ''jihad'' against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan Marxist regime]], which was facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the [[Maktab al-Khidamat]] (MAK).&lt;ref name="MAKTAB-AL-KHIDAMAT-GLOBALSECURITY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maktab al-Khidamat|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/maktab_al-khidamat.htm|date=January 11, 2006|access-date=February 11, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214205625/http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/maktab_al-khidamat.htm|archive-date=February 14, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, MAK was established in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, by bin Laden and [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. MAK organized [[al-Qaeda safe house|guest houses]] in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. MAK was funded by the Saudi government as well as by individual Muslims including Saudi businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Bin Laden also became a major financier of the ''mujahideen'', spending his own money and using his connections to influence public opinion about the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=19}}. Quotes taken from {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=42}} and {{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Omar Abdel-Rahman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Omar Abdel-Rahman]]]]

From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the US, the hub of which was the [[Al Kifah Refugee Center]] at the Farouq Mosque on [[Brooklyn]]'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were "double agent" [[Ali Mohamed]], whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called "bin Laden's first trainer",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html Cloonan ''Frontline'' interview], PBS, July 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Blind Sheikh" [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], a leading recruiter of ''mujahideen'' for Afghanistan. Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

MAK and foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers, or "Afghan Arabs", did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan ''mujahideen'' fought the Soviets and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|the communist Afghan government]], it is estimated that there were never more than two thousand foreign ''mujahideen'' on the field at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number who participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.&lt;ref name="THE-WAR-ON-TERROR-AND-THE-POLITICS-OF-VIOLENCE-IN-PAKISTAN"&gt;{{cite web

The Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s Communist Afghan government lasted for three more years, before it was overrun by elements of the ''mujahideen''.

===Expanding operations===
Toward the end of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] mission in Afghanistan, some foreign ''mujahideen'' wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Palestine and [[Kashmir]]. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations. One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.

Research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting in Afghanistan between leaders of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden took place.&lt;ref&gt;Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Chapter on Terrorist Financing, [https://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Ch6.pdf 9/11 Commission Report] p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached to link bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="RebellionWright"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by August 20, 1988. A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]''&amp;thinsp;) to follow one's superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, bin Laden's former bodyguard, [[Nasser al-Bahri]], gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving ''bayat'' when he swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda chief.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bahri, Nasser, ''Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al-Qaeda''. p. 123. Thin Man Press. London. {{ISBN|9780956247360}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because "its existence was still a closely held secret."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Azzam was assassinated in 1989 and MAK broke up, significant numbers of MAK followers joined bin Laden's new organization.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In November 1989, [[Ali Mohamed]], a former special forces sergeant stationed at [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became "deeply involved with bin Laden's plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osama bin Laden: The Past|url=http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html|access-date=January 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218211532/http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html|archive-date=February 18, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gulf War and the start of US enmity===
{{Main|Gulf War}}

Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.

In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his ''mujahideen'' to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Jehl|first1=Douglas|title=A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked away|work=The New York Times|date=December 27, 2001|pages=A1, B4|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html|access-date=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the "land of the two mosques" ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.

===Sudan===
From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]], who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.

A key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport. Bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his stipend, $7{{nbs}}million a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSAMA-BIN-LADEN-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-HIS-POLITICAL-LIFE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Osama bin Laden: A Chronology of His Political Life|publisher=[[PBS]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline///shows/binladen/etc/cron.html|access-date=January 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205100703/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html|archive-date=December 5, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family publicly disowned him.

In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, [[Atef Sedki]]. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1995, an [[Attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak|attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak]] led to the expulsion of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ), and in May 1996, of bin Laden from Sudan.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

According to [[Pakistani-American]] businessman [[Mansoor Ijaz]], the Sudanese government offered the [[Clinton Administration]] numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Ijaz's claims appeared in numerous [[op-ed]] pieces, including one in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05|title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize|work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 5, 2001|access-date=March 22, 2010|first1=Mansoor|last1=Ijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan [[Timothy M.

Several sources dispute Ijaz's claim, including the [[9/11 Commission]], which concluded in part: {{quote|Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the US. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin.

===Refuge in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Taliban's rise to power|Afghan training camp}}

After the fall of the Afghan communist regime in 1992, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for four years and plagued by constant infighting between various ''mujahideen'' groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} This situation allowed the Taliban to organize. The Taliban also garnered support from graduates of Islamic schools, which are called ''madrassa''. According to [[Ahmed Rashid]], five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]], a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but the school is largely attended by [[Afghan refugees]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2002" /&gt; This institution reflected [[Salafi]] beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar. Bin Laden's contacts were laundering donations to these schools, and Islamic banks were used to transfer money to an "array" of charities which served as front groups for al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Napoleoni|2003|pp=121–23}}; {{Harvnb|Akacem|2005}} "Napoleoni does a decent job of covering al-Qaida and presents some numbers and estimates that are of value to terrorism scholars."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ''mujahideen'' who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord [[Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi]]'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, the Taliban captured the capital city [[Kabul]] in September 1996.

In 1996, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan provided a perfect staging ground for al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kronstadt|Katzman|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While not officially working together, Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many Western observers dubbed the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as, "the world's first terrorist-sponsored state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DIM-2017-U-016117-2Rev.pdf|title=Al-Qaeda Core: A Case Study, p. 11|website=cna.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010011216/https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DIM-2017-U-016117-2Rev.pdf|archive-date=2018-10-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this time, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of [[055 Brigade|Brigade 055]], an elite element of the Taliban's army. The Brigade mostly consisted of foreign fighters, veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and adherents to the ideology of the mujahideen. In November 2001, as [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]] had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those who survived were thought to have escaped into Pakistan along with bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101011105-181591,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011103091516/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101011105-181591,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 3, 2001|work=Time|first1=Daniel|last1=Eisenberg|title=Secrets of Brigade 055|date=October 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Robertson, Nic|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview|title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace|publisher=CNN|access-date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is reason to doubt this.&lt;ref&gt;Roggio, Bill [http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/10/taliban_have_not_spl.php Taliban have not split from al Qaeda: sources] October 7, 2008 ''The Long War Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; According to senior US military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Partlow, Joshua.

In a report released May 27, 2020, the United Nations' Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team stated that the Taliban-Al Qaeda relations remain strong to this day and additionally, Al Qaeda itself has admitted that it operates inside Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleventh report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted pursuant to resolution 2501 (2019) concerning the Taliban and other associated individuals and entities constituting a threat to the peace, stability and security of Afghanistan|work= United Nations Security Council|date= May 27, 2020|access-date=January 16, 2021|url= https://www.undocs.org/S/2020/415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2020, a [[United Nations]] report stated that the Al Qaeda group is still active in twelve provinces in Afghanistan and its leader al-Zawahiri is still based in the country.&lt;ref name="https://www.daijiworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=734350|title=Al Qaeda active in 12 Afghan provinces: UN|publisher=daijiworld.com|website=daijiworld.com|date=July 26, 2020|access-date=July 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the UN Monitoring Team estimated that the total number of Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan were "between 400 and 600".&lt;ref name="https://www.daijiworld.com"/&gt;

===Call for global Salafi jihadism===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

In 1994, the Salafi groups waging [[Salafi jihadism]] in Bosnia entered into decline, and groups such as the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of [[non-state armed groups|non-state armed]] [[Clandestine cell system|cells]] in Bosnia in late 1995. At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for ''[[Jihadi international]]'' Muslims who believed that extremist-''jihad'' must be fought on a global level. Al-Qaeda also sought to open the "offensive phase" of the global Salafi ''jihad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|pp=48, 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for "solidarity with Islamic causes around the world", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trofimov|2006|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwas===
In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its ''jihad'' to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. Bin Laden issued a ''fatwa'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bin Laden's Fatwa|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html|publisher=[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi|Al Quds Al Arabi]]|date=August 1996|access-date=January 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108175653/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html|archive-date=January 8, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amounted to a public declaration of war against the US and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda's resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes.

On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a ''fatwa'' calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Summary taken from bin Laden's May 26, 1998, interview with American journalist [[John Miller (journalist)|John Miller]]. Most recently broadcast in the documentary ''Age of Terror'', part 4, with translations checked by Barry Purkis (archive researcher).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the banner of the World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders, they declared:

{{quote|[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies{{snd}}civilians and military{{snd}}is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together [and] fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|title=Text of Fatwah Urging Jihad Against Americans|access-date=May 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422210853/http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|archive-date=April 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a ''fatwa''. However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ''[[ulema]]'' (which they saw as the paid servants of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' rulers), and took it upon themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benjamin|Simon|2002|p=117}}. "By issuing fatwas, bin Laden and his followers are acting out a kind of self-appointment as alim: they are asserting their rights as interpreters of Islamic law."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=questionable statement as at least one of the other signers of the fatwa may have indeed been able to issue such an edict; bin Laden and al-Zawahiri were co-signers|date=May 2009}}

In 2003, President [[Bashar al-Assad]] revealed in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted al-Qaeda even existed. He was quoted as saying, "Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?" He went on further to remark about bin Laden, commenting "[he] cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world? This is illogical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-05-25-assad_x.htm|title=Assad doubts existence of al-Qaeda|work=USA Today|access-date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 al-Zawahiri announced al-Qaeda was establishing a front in India to "wage jihad against its enemies, to liberate its land, to restore its sovereignty, and to revive its Caliphate." Al-Zawahiri nominated India as a beachhead for regional jihad taking in neighboring countries such as Myanmar and Bangladesh. The motivation for the video was questioned, as it appeared the militant group was struggling to remain relevant in light of the emerging prominence of ISIS.&lt;ref name="IndiaAlQaeda"&gt;{{cite news|title=India security alert after Al Qaeda calls for jihad in subcontinent|url=http://www.indiagazette.com/index.php/sid/225407619|date=September 4, 2014|access-date=September 8, 2014|work=India Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new wing was to be known as "Qaedat al-Jihad fi'shibhi al-qarrat al-Hindiya" or al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). Leaders of several Indian Muslim organizations rejected al-Zawahiri's pronouncement, saying they could see no good coming from it, and viewed it as a threat to Muslim youth in the country.&lt;ref name="IndiaGazette"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Muslims Reject al-Qaida call for Jihad|url=http://www.indiagazette.com/index.php/sid/225460583|date=September 6, 2014|access-date=September 8, 2014|work=India Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 ''[[Zee News]]'' reported that [[Bruce Riedel]], a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official for South Asia, had accused the Pakistani military intelligence and [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) of organising and assisting Al-Qaeda to organise in India, that Pakistan ought to be warned that it will be placed on the list of [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]], and that "Zawahiri made the tape in his hideout in Pakistan, no doubt, and many Indians suspect the ISI is helping to protect him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/al-qaeda-launches-india-wing-pakistan-army-isi-targeting-india-to-hit-nawaz-sharif_1465727.html|title=Al Qaeda launches India wing: 'Pakistan Army, ISI targeting India to hit Nawaz Sharif'|work=Zee News|date=September 6, 2014|access-date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/india/al-qaeda-wing-in-india-threatening-video-pakistan-isi-exposed-indian-ib-report-1515097.html|title=al-Qaeda's wing in India: Pakistan's ISI exposed over threatening video|work=news.oneindia.in|date=September 4, 2014|access-date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/feature/danger-from-isis-al-qaeda-what-india-should-do-1516217.html|title=Danger from ISIS and Al Qaeda: What India should do|work=news.oneindia.in|date=September 5, 2014|access-date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/twenty-years-war/496736/|title=Al-Qaeda Has Been at War With the United States for 20 Years|first=Dominic|last=Tierney|date=August 23, 2016|website=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992===
On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda launched its first attack, the [[1992 Yemen hotel bombings]]. Two bombs were detonated in [[Aden]], Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.&lt;ref name="wright174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, [[Operation Restore Hope]]. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was barely noticed. No American soldiers were killed because no soldiers were staying in the hotel which was bombed. However, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker were killed in the bombing. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured.&lt;ref name="wright174"/&gt; Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by al-Qaeda's members, [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jansen|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}

In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate United States President [[Bill Clinton]] while the president was in [[Manila]] for the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the [[U.S. Secret Service|US Secret Service]]. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Osama bin Laden came within minutes of killing Bill Clinton |first1=Tom|last1=Leonard|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 25, 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html|access-date=December 25, 2009|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225150252/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html|archive-date=December 25, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|bombed the US embassies in East Africa]], killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, a barrage of [[cruise missile]]s launched by the US military devastated an al-Qaeda base in [[Khost]], Afghanistan. The network's capacity was unharmed. In late 1999 and 2000, Al-Qaeda planned [[2000 millennium attack plots|attacks to coincide with the millennium]], masterminded by [[Abu Zubaydah]] and involving [[Abu Qatada]], which would include the bombing of Christian holy sites in Jordan, the bombing of [[Los Angeles International Airport]] by [[Ahmed Ressam]], and the bombing of the {{USS|The Sullivans|DDG-68}}.

On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen [[USS Cole bombing|bombed]] the [[Guided missile destroyer|missile destroyer]] ''[[USS Cole (DDG-67)|USS Cole]]'' in a suicide attack, killing 17 US servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the US itself.

===September 11 attacks===

[[File:FEMA - 4235 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-28-2001 in New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Aftermath of the September 11 attacks]]

The September 11 attacks on America by al-Qaeda killed 2,977 people{{snd}}2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, and 55 military personnel. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the [[United States Capitol]] or the [[White House]], crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]. It was also the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.

The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden#1998 Fatwa|1998 ''fatwa'']] issued against the US and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm|title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders|access-date=June 16, 2010|date=February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander [[Mohamed Atta]] as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], and [[Hambali]] as the key planners and part of the political and military command.

Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001 praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/|title=Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks|publisher=CNN|access-date=July 6, 2006|date=September 17, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705161654/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/|archive-date=July 5, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the US was actively oppressing Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Esposito|2002|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in "[[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]], [[Chechnya]], [[Kashmir]] and Iraq" and Muslims should retain the "right to attack in reprisal". He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at people, but "America's icons of military and economic power", despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning when most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating the maximum number of human casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Miir 'Osama claims he has nukes: If U.S. uses N-arms it will get the same response' "Dawn: the Internet Edition" November 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the US East Coast. The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack "might get out of hand".&lt;ref name="AL-QAIDA-LEADERS-SAY-NUCLEAR-POWER-STATIONS-WERE-ORIGINAL-TARGETS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Al-Qaida leaders say nuclear power stations were original targets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,1284,788431,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=September 9, 2002|access-date=January 11, 2007 |first1=Giles|last1=Tremlett|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122160702/http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0%2C1284%2C788431%2C00.html|archive-date=January 22, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Qaeda-SCALED-BACK-10-PLANE-PLOT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Al Qaeda Scaled Back 10-Plane Plot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45853-2004Jun16_2.html|work=The Washington Post|date=June 17, 2004|access-date=January 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War on Terror==

[[File:US 10th Mountain Division soldiers in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|US troops in Afghanistan]]

In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|responded]], and began to prepare its [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. The US offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).

The [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. US President [[George W. Bush]] responded by saying: "We know he's guilty. Turn him over",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20011015-NEWS-310159983|title=US Jets Pound Targets Around Kabul|work=[[The Portsmouth Herald]]|date=October 15, 2001|access-date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] warned the Taliban regime: "Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/blair-to-taliban-surrender-bin-laden-or-surrender-power-1.295241|title=Blair to Taliban: Surrender bin Laden or surrender power|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=October 3, 2001|access-date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] removed the Taliban government as part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. As a result of the US [[special forces]] and [[close air support|air support]] for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.

By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success. Nevertheless, a significant [[Taliban insurgency]] remained in Afghanistan.

Debate continued regarding the nature of al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks. The [[United States State Department|US State Department]] released a [[Videos of Osama bin Laden#December 13, 2001|videotape]] showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html|title=U.S. Releases Videotape of Osama Bin Laden|access-date=July 4, 2006|date=December 13, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625223529/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html|archive-date=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/september11/story/0,11209,619188,00.html|author=Morris, Steven|title=US urged to detail origin of tape|work=The Guardian|location=UK|access-date=July 11, 2006|date=December 15, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks. The tape was aired on many [[television channels]], with an accompanying English translation provided by the [[US Defense Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/tape.transcript/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202084109/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/tape.transcript/ |archive-date=February 2, 2007 |title=Transcript of Osama bin Laden videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, the [[9/11 Commission]] officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|access-date=April 27, 2006|date=September 20, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427220632/http://www.9-11commission.gov/|archive-date=April 27, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|videotape]] released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 [[1982 Lebanon War|invasion of Lebanon]]: "As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm|title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=July 12, 2006|date=November 1, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711055450/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm|archive-date=July 11, 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Al Qaeda in Bosnia and Herzegovina|al-Qaeda]] was present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its members were mostly veterans of the [[Bosnian mujahideen|El Mudžahid]] detachment of the Bosnian Muslim [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Three al-Qaeda operatives carried out the [[Mostar car bombing]] in 1997. The operatives were closely linked to and financed by the [[Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] founded by then-prince King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019|reason=for the whole paragraph}}

Before the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, westerners who had been recruits at al-Qaeda training camps were sought after by al-Qaeda's military wing. Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with [[Mohamed Atta]], an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the [[Hamburg Cell]]. [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Mohammed Atef]] would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the [[9/11 hijackers]]. Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="9-11commission.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/30/terrorism.september113|title=Last words of a terrorist &amp;#124; The Observer|work=The Guardian|access-date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. The group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, with online activities that include financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, and information dissemination, gathering and sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Timothy |last1=Thomas |url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/03spring/thomas.pdf |title=Al Qaeda and the Internet: The Danger of Cyberplanning |date=February 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030326120423/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/03spring/thomas.pdf |archive-date=March 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]]'s al-Qaeda movement in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, both before and after the death of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] (the former leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]]), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]], has a regular [[web presence|presence on the Web]].

The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur [[Nick Berg]] being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of [[Paul Johnson (hostage)|Paul Johnson]], [[Kim Sun-il]], and [[Daniel Pearl]], were first posted on jihadist websites.{{citation needed|date=January 2019|reason=The whole paragraph}}

In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to [[Aljazeera|al Jazeera]] as he had done in the past. Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain they would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editing out anything critical of the [[Saudi royal family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373884|title=Bin Laden Identifies Saudi Arabia as the Enemy of Mujahideen Unity|author=Scheuer, Michael|date=January 2008|work=Terrorism Focus|publisher=Jamestown Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625152714/http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373884 |archive-date=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Online communications====
In 2007, al-Qaeda released ''[[Mujahedeen Secrets]]'', encryption software used for online and cellular communications. A later version, ''[[Mujahideen Secrets 2]]'', was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html|work=The New York Times|first1=Eric|last1=Schmitt|first2=Michael S.|last2=Schmidt|title=Qaeda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence|date=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation network===
Al-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including "several [[Boeing 727]] aircraft", [[turboprops]] and [[executive jet]]s, according to a 2010 [[Reuters]] story. Based on a US [[Department of Homeland Security]] report, the story said al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to ten tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly [[kidnapping]] Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaynor|first1=Tim|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60C3E820100113?type=politicsNews|title=Al Qaeda linked to rogue aviation network|work=Reuters|date=January 13, 2010|access-date=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged CIA involvement==
{{Main|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}} Experts debate the notion al-Qaeda attacks were an indirect result from the American CIA's [[Operation Cyclone]] program to help the Afghan [[Islamic mujahid movement|mujahideen]]. [[Robin Cook]], British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and bin Laden were "a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies", and that "Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html |title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means |author=Cook, Robin |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=July 8, 2005 |date=July 8, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710025703/http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0%2C12780%2C1523838%2C00.html |archive-date=July 10, 2005 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Munir Akram]], [[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations]] from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 19, 2008:
{{quote|The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/opinion/lweb22pakistan.html|access-date=October 17, 2009|title=Pakistan, Terrorism and Drugs|department=Opinion|work=The New York Times|first1=Munir|last1=Akram|date=January 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A variety of sources, including [[CNN]] journalist [[Peter Bergen]], [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani ISI]] Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as [[Vincent Cannistraro]], deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.

Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coll|2005|pp=145–46, 155–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen further argues that foreign mujahideen had no need for American funds since they received several million dollars per year from internal sources. Lastly, he argues that Americans could not have trained the mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan, and the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.

According to Bergen, who conducted the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997: the idea that "the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden{{nbs}}... [is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this{{nbs}}... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently{{nbs}}...

==Alleged Saudi and Emirati involvement==
{{See also|Al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen|Al-Qaeda in Syria}}
A CNN report has revealed that [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) have been handing out sophisticated American-made weapons to al-Qaeda-linked fighters in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia, UAE gave US arms to al-Qaeda-linked groups: Report |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/saudi-arabia-uae-gave-weapons-al-qaeda-linked-groups-cnn-190205055102300.html |work=al-Jazeera |date=5 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, US Vice President [[Joe Biden]] said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had "poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Al-Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were [[Al-Nusra Front|al-Nusra]], and al Qaeda, and the extremist elements of [[Jihadism|jihadis]] coming from other parts of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Biden Is the Only Honest Man in Washington |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/07/joe-biden-is-the-only-honest-man-in-washington/ |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broader influence==
[[Anders Behring Breivik]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], was inspired by Al-Qaeda, calling it "the most successful revolutionary movement in the world." While admitting different aims, he sought to "create a European version of Al-Qaida."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2112701,00.html |title=Breivik Studied al-Qaeda Attacks |newspaper=Time |date=April 20, 2012 |access-date=May 8, 2012 |last1=Ritter |first1=Karl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525123005/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C2112701%2C00.html |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/world/europe/norway-anders-breivik-studied-al-qaeda.html|title=Norway: Militant Studied Al Qaeda|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 2012|access-date=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appropriate response to offshoots is a subject of debate. A journalist reported in 2012 that a senior US military planner had asked: "Should we resort to drones and Special Operations raids every time some group raises the black banner of al Qaeda? How long can we continue to chase offshoots of offshoots around the world?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/will-obama-end-war-terror-63627|title=Will Obama End the War on Terror?|last1=Klaidman|first1=Daniel|date=2012-12-17|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Khawarij}}

[[Islamic extremism]] dates back to the [[Kharijites]] of the 7th century. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=The Balance of Islam in Challenging Extremism |access-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archive-date=August 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|first1=Mohamad|last1=Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a number of sources, a "wave of revulsion" has been expressed against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by "religious scholars, former fighters and militants" who are alarmed by al-Qaeda's takfir and its killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}. Quotes taken from {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|pp=106–07}} and {{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noman Benotman]], a former militant member of the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]] (LIFG), went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007, after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months after "they were said to have renounced violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AA64F530-BCA8-40B0-8226-22154CCD1032.htm|title=Libya releases scores of prisoners |publisher=English.aljazeera.net|date=April 9, 2008|access-date=March 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718232829/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AA64F530-BCA8-40B0-8226-22154CCD1032.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks,&lt;ref name="RebellionWright"/&gt; the Saudi sheikh [[Salman al-Ouda]] delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him:
{{quote|My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed{{nbs}}... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?&lt;ref name=theunraveling&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda had dropped in the Muslim world in the years before 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/05/taking_stock_in_the_war_on_ter.html|title=Taking Stock of the War on Terror|publisher=Realclearpolitics.com|date=May 22, 2008|access-date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support of suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, dropped by half or more in the last five years.{{when|date=August 2018}} In Saudi Arabia, only ten percent had a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December 2017 poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based [[think tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/12/17/saudi.poll/index.html|title=December 18, 2007 Poll: Most Saudis oppose al Qaeda|publisher=CNN |date=December 18, 2007|access-date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the imprisoned [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]], an influential Afghan Arab, "ideological godfather of al-Qaeda", and former supporter of takfir, withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book ''[[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif#Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World|Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam]]'' ({{lang-en|Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World}}).

Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group|LIFG]] completed a new "code" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled "Corrective Studies". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG's reversal may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda's recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/09/libya.jihadi.code/ "New jihad code threatens al Qaeda"], Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank, [[CNN]], November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
Bilal Abdul Kareem, an American journalist based in Syria created a documentary about [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]], al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia. The documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving al-Shabab. The members made accusations of segregation, lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism. In response to Kareem, the [[Global Islamic Media Front]] condemned Kareem, called him a liar, and denied the accusations from the former fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2017/06/06/new-release-from-the-global-islamic-media-front-lies-in-disguise-a-response-from-the-deep-heart-of-a-mujahid-of-the-lions-of-islam-in-somalia/|title=New release from the Global Islamic Media Front: "Lies in Disguise: A Response From the Deep Heart of a Mujāhid of the Lions of Islām in Somalia"|date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2014 after the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] declared that they had restored the [[Caliphate]], an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group [[Abu Muhammad al-Adnani]] claiming that "the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the Caliphate's authority." The speech included a religious refutation of Al-Qaeda for being too lenient regarding [[Shiites]] and their refusal to recognize the authority [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], al-Adnani specifically noting: "It is not suitable for a state to give allegiance to an organization." He also recalled a past instance in which [[Osama bin Laden]] called on al-Qaeda members and supporters to give allegiance to [[Abu Omar al-Baghdadi]] when the group was still solely operating in Iraq, as the [[Islamic State of Iraq]], and condemned [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] for not making this same claim for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Zawahiri was encouraging factionalism and division between former allies of ISIL such as the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/isis-spokesman-declares-caliphate-rebrands-group-as-islamic-state.html|title=ISIS Spokesman Declares Caliphate, Rebrands Group as "Islamic State"|last=SITE|website=news.siteintelgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2014/06/29/al-furqan-media-presents-a-new-audio-message-from-the-islamic-states-shaykh-abu-mu%E1%B8%A5ammad-al-adnani-al-shami-this-is-the-promise-of-god/|title=al-Furqān Media presents a new audio message from the Islamic State's Shaykh Abū Muḥammad al 'Adnānī al-Shāmī: "This Is the Promise Of God"|date=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
