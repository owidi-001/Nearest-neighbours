[[File:AMH-5633-KB Map of the Turkish empire.jpg|thumb|left|A Dutch map from 1635, referencing the "Turkish Empire" (''TVRCICVM IMPERIVM'').]]
The word ''Ottoman'' is a historical [[anglicisation]] of the name of [[Osman I]], the founder of the Empire and of the ruling [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]] (also known as the Ottoman dynasty). Osman's name in turn was the Turkish form of the Arabic name ''[[Uthman (name)|ʿUthmān]]'' ({{lang|ota-Arab|عثمان}}). In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], the empire was referred to as {{lang|tr|Devlet-i ʿAlīye-yi ʿO&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;mānīye}} ({{lang|ota-Arab|دولت عليه عثمانیه}}),&lt;ref name="twareekh.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twareekh.com/images/upload/aboutus/ottmani10liras1334F-.jpg |title=Ottoman banknote with Arabic script |access-date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "The Supreme Ottoman State", or alternatively {{lang|tr|ʿO&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;mānlı Devleti}} ({{lang|ota-Arab|عثمانلى دولتى}}). In [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]], it is known as {{lang|tr|Osmanlı İmparatorluğu}} ("The Ottoman Empire") or {{lang|tr|Osmanlı Devleti}} ("The Ottoman State").

The Turkish word for "Ottoman" ({{lang-tr|Osmanlı}}) originally referred to the tribal followers of Osman in the fourteenth century. The word subsequently came to be used to refer to the empire's military-administrative elite. In contrast, the term "Turk" ({{lang|tr|Türk}}) was used to refer to the Anatolian peasant and tribal population and was seen as a disparaging term when applied to urban, educated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Introduction |date=2009 |page=xxvi}}

The term {{lang|tr|Rūmī}} was also used to refer to Turkish speakers by the other Muslim peoples of the empire and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=A Rome of One's Own: Cultural Geography and Identity in the Lands of Rum |journal=Muqarnas |volume=24 |date=2007 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As applied to Ottoman Turkish-speakers, this term began to fall out of use at the end of the seventeenth century, and instead the word increasingly became associated with the Greek population of the empire, a meaning that it still bears in Turkey today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Greene |first=Molly|title=The Edinburgh History of the Greeks, 1453 to 1768 |date=2015 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, the names '''Ottoman Empire''', '''Turkish Empire''' and '''Turkey''' were often used interchangeably, with ''Turkey'' being increasingly favoured both in formal and informal situations. This dichotomy was officially ended in 1920–23, when the newly established [[Ankara]]-based [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish government]] chose Turkey as the sole official name. At present, most scholarly historians avoid the terms "Turkey", "Turks", and "Turkish" when referring to the Ottomans, due to the empire's multinational character.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Soucek |first=Svat |title=Ottoman Maritime Wars, 1416–1700 |publisher=The Isis Press |place=Istanbul |date=2015 |isbn=978-975-428-554-3 |page=8 |quote=The scholarly community specializing in Ottoman studies has of late virtually banned the use of "Turkey", "Turks", and "Turkish" from acceptable vocabulary, declaring "Ottoman" and its expanded use mandatory and permitting its "Turkish" rival only in linguistic and philological contexts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum]] declined in the 13th century, [[Anatolia]] was divided into a patchwork of independent Turkish principalities known as the [[Anatolian Beyliks]]. One of these beyliks, in the region of [[Bithynia]] on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire, was led by the Turkish tribal leader Osman I (d. 1323/4), a figure of obscure origins from whom the name Ottoman is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kermeli |first=Eugenia  |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Osman I |date=2009 |page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osman's early followers consisted both of Turkish tribal groups and Byzantine renegades, with many but not all converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |page=59}}

A Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Bapheus]] in 1302 contributed to Osman's rise as well.

In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over Anatolia and the [[History of the Balkans|Balkans]]. The earliest conflicts began during the [[Byzantine–Ottoman wars]], waged in [[Anatolia]] in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid-14th century, followed by the [[Bulgarian–Ottoman wars]] and the [[Serbian–Ottoman wars]] waged beginning in the mid 14th century. Much of this period was characterised by [[Rumelia|Ottoman expansion into the Balkans]]. Osman's son, [[Orhan]], captured the northwestern Anatolian city of [[Bursa]] in 1326, making it the new capital of the Ottoman state and supplanting Byzantine control in the region. The important port city of [[Thessaloniki]] was captured from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in 1387 and sacked. The Ottoman victory in [[Battle of Kosovo|Kosovo in 1389]] effectively marked [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|the end of Serbian power]] in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Kosova|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnbw1wsacSAC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=95–96|isbn=978-0-8108-5309-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] for the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Tsardom of Vidin]] in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale [[Crusades|crusade]] of the [[Middle Ages]], failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Nicolle|title=Nicopolis 1396: The Last Crusade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hUst0z-oEQC|year=1999|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85532-918-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{History of the Ottoman Empire}}
As the Turks expanded into the Balkans, the [[Sieges of Constantinople#Ottoman Sieges|conquest of Constantinople]] became a crucial objective. The Ottomans had already wrested control of nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but the strong defence of Constantinople's strategic position on the [[Bosphorus]] Strait made it difficult to conquer. In 1402, the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the [[Turco-Mongol]] leader [[Timur]], founder of the [[Timurid Empire]], invaded Ottoman Anatolia from the east. In the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan [[Bayezid I]] as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The [[Ottoman Interregnum|ensuing civil war]], also known as the ''Fetret Devri'', lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when [[Mehmed I]] emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA363|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=363|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balkan territories lost by the Ottomans after 1402, including Thessaloniki, Macedonia, and Kosovo, were later recovered by [[Murad II]] between the 1430s and 1450s. On 10 November 1444, Murad repelled the [[Crusade of Varna]] by defeating the Hungarian, Polish, and [[Wallachia]]n armies under [[Władysław III of Poland]] (also King of Hungary) and [[John Hunyadi]] at the [[Battle of Varna]], although Albanians under [[Skanderbeg]] continued to resist. Four years later, John Hunyadi prepared another army of Hungarian and Wallachian forces to attack the Turks, but was again defeated at the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mesut Uyar|author2=Edward J.

In the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East. These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya |editor-last=İnalcık |editor-first=Halil |editor2=Donald Quataert |title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1914 |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |pages=413–14 |chapter=Crisis and Change, 1590–1699 |isbn=978-0-521-57456-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges, enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful, both militarily and economically.&lt;ref name=decline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Şahin |first=Kaya |title=Empire and Power in the reign of Süleyman: Narrating the Sixteenth-Century Ottoman World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013|isbn=978-1-107-03442-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of the mid-twentieth century once characterised this period as one of stagnation and decline, but this view is now rejected by the majority of academics.&lt;ref name=decline/&gt;

The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488 initiated [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] throughout the 16th century. Despite the growing European presence in the Indian Ocean, Ottoman trade with the east continued to flourish. Cairo, in particular, benefitted from the rise of Yemeni coffee as a popular consumer commodity.

After the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718]], the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] confirmed the loss of the Banat, Serbia and [[Oltenia|"Little Walachia" (Oltenia)]] to Austria.

[[Selim III]] (1789–1807) made the first major attempts to [[Ottoman military reform efforts|modernise the army]], but his reforms were hampered by the religious leadership and the [[Janissary]] corps.

It was a costly enterprise for Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had lost his fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827. Thus began the first [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833)]], during which the French-trained army of Muhammad Ali Pasha, under the command of his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], defeated the Ottoman Army as it marched into [[Anatolia]], reaching the city of [[Kütahya]] within {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of the capital, Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Karsh, Effraim ''Islamic Imperialism A History'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006 p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In desperation, Sultan [[Mahmud II]] appealed to the empire's traditional arch-rival Russia for help, asking Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] to send an expeditionary force to assist him.&lt;ref name="Karsh, Effraim page 96"&gt;Karsh, Effraim ''Islamic Imperialism A History'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006 p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In return for signing the [[Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi]], the Russians sent the expeditionary force which deterred Ibrahim Pasha from marching any further towards Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Karsh, Effraim page 96"/&gt; Under the terms of the [[Convention of Kütahya]], signed on 5 May 1833, Muhammad Ali Pasha agreed to abandon his campaign against the Sultan, in exchange for which he was made the ''[[wali|vali]]'' (governor) of the ''[[vilayet]]s'' (provinces) of [[Crete]], [[Aleppo]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], [[Damascus]] and [[Sidon]] (the latter four comprising modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]), and given the right to collect taxes in [[Adana]].&lt;ref name="Karsh, Effraim page 96"/&gt; Had it not been for the Russian intervention, Sultan [[Mahmud II]] could have faced the risk of being overthrown and Muhammad Ali Pasha could have even become the new Sultan.

In 1839, the [[Sublime Porte]] attempted to take back what it lost to the ''[[de facto]]'' autonomous, but ''[[de jure]]'' still Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]], but its forces were initially defeated, which led to the [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]].

By the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the "[[sick man of Europe]]". Three suzerain states – the [[Principality of Serbia]], [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] – moved towards ''de jure'' independence during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== Decline and modernisation (1828–1908) ===
{{Main|Decline of the Ottoman Empire}}
During the [[Tanzimat]] period (1839–1876), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern [[Conscription in the Ottoman Empire|conscripted army]], banking system reforms, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ishtiaq|first=Hussain|title=The Tanzimat: Secular reforms in the Ottoman Empire|url=http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf|publisher=Faith Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and guilds with modern factories. The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul in 1840. American inventor [[Samuel Morse]] received an Ottoman patent for the telegraph in 1847, which was issued by Sultan [[Abdülmecid I|Abdülmecid]] who personally tested the new invention.&lt;ref&gt;Yakup Bektas, "The sultan's messenger: Cultural constructions of ottoman telegraphy, 1847–1880." ''Technology and Culture'' 41.4 (2000): 669–696.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the ''[[Kanûn-u Esâsî]]''. The empire's [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional era]] was short-lived. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it.

In this period, the Ottoman Empire spent only small amounts of public funds on education; for example in 1860–61 only 0.2 per cent of the total budget was invested in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

As the Ottoman state attempted to modernise its infrastructure and army in response to threats from the outside, it also opened itself up to a different kind of threat: that of creditors. Indeed, as the historian Eugene Rogan has written, "the single greatest threat to the independence of the Middle East" in the nineteenth century "was not the armies of Europe but its banks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Arabs: A History|last = Rogan|first = Eugene|publisher = Penguin|year = 2011|page = 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman state, which had begun taking on debt with the Crimean War, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1875.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Arabs: A History|last = Rogan|first = Eugene|publisher = Penguin|year = 2011|page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881, the Ottoman Empire agreed to have its debt controlled by an institution known as the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]], a council of European men with presidency alternating between France and Britain. The body controlled swaths of the Ottoman economy, and used its position to ensure that European capital continued to penetrate the empire, often to the detriment of local Ottoman interests.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Abdul Hamid II, popularly known as "Abdul Hamid the Damned" on account of his cruelty and paranoia, was so fearful of the threat of a coup that he did not allow his army to conduct war games, lest this serve as the cover for a coup, but he did see the need for military mobilisation. In 1883, a German military mission under General Baron [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Colmar von der Goltz]] arrived to train the Ottoman Army, leading to the so-called "Goltz generation" of German-trained officers who were to play a notable role in the politics of the last years of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Akmeșe, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, some 7–9&amp;nbsp;million Muslims from its former territories in the Caucasus, [[Crimea]], Balkans, and the [[Mediterranean]] islands migrated to Anatolia and [[Eastern Thrace]].&lt;ref name="Karpat2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kemal H Karpat|title=Studies on Turkish politics and society: selected articles and essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL4Ua6gGyWUC|year=2004|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-13322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Empire lost the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13), it lost all its [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan]] territories except [[East Thrace]] (European Turkey).

==== Young Turk movement ====
The [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] (1908–1922) began with the [[Second Constitutional Era]], a moment of hope and promise established with the [[Young Turk Revolution]]. It restored the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and brought in [[List of political parties in the Ottoman Empire|multi-party politics]] with a [[Elections in the Ottoman Empire|two-stage electoral system]] ([[Ottoman electoral law|electoral law]]) under the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman parliament]]. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire's citizens to modernise the state's institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers. Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reynolds|2011|p= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire.

[[File:Declaration of the 1908 Revolution in Ottoman Empire.png|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] by the leaders of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]] in 1908]]

Members of [[Young Turks]] movement who had once gone underground now established their parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Erickson|2013|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them "[[Committee of Union and Progress]]", and "[[Freedom and Accord Party]]" were major parties. On the other end of the spectrum were ethnic parties, which included [[Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party in Palestine (Poale Zion)|Poale Zion]], [[Al-Fatat]], and [[Armenian national movement]] organised under [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]. Profiting from the civil strife, Austria-Hungary officially annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908. The last of the [[Census in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman censuses]] was performed in [[1914 population statistics for the Ottoman Empire|1914]]. Despite [[Ottoman military reforms|military reforms]] which reconstituted the [[Ottoman Modern Army]], the Empire lost its North African territories and the Dodecanese in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911) and almost all of its European territories in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913). The Empire faced continuous unrest in the years leading up to [[World War I]], including the [[31 March Incident]] and two further coups in [[1912 Ottoman coup d'état|1912]] and [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|1913]].

====World War I====
{{main|Ottoman entry into World War I|Ottoman Empire during World War I}}

[[File:M 113 5 amiral Souchon et ses officiers.jpg|thumb|Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]], who commanded the [[Black Sea Raid]] on 29 October 1914, and his officers in Ottoman naval uniforms.]]

The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. The Ottoman participation in the war began with the combined [[Black Sea Raid|German-Ottoman surprise attack]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast of the [[Russian Empire]] on 29 October 1914. Following the attack, the Russian Empire (2 November 1914)&lt;ref name="oxfordreference-timeline"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191737640.timeline.0001|title=Timeline: Ottoman Empire (c. 1285 - 1923)|publisher=[[Oxford Reference]]|isbn=9780191737640|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its allies [[French Third Republic|France]] (5 November 1914)&lt;ref name="oxfordreference-timeline"/&gt; and the [[British Empire]] (5 November 1914)&lt;ref name="oxfordreference-timeline"/&gt; declared war on the Ottoman Empire (also on 5 November 1914, the British government changed the status of the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] and [[Cyprus Convention|Cyprus]], which were [[de jure]] Ottoman territories prior to the war, as [[British protectorate]]s.)

The Ottomans successfully defended the [[Dardanelles]] strait during the [[Gallipoli campaign]] (1915–1916) and achieved initial victories against British forces in the first two years of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], such as the [[Siege of Kut]] (1915–1916); but the [[Arab Revolt]] (1916–1918) turned the tide against the Ottomans in the Middle East. In the [[Caucasus campaign]], however, the Russian forces had the upper hand from the beginning, especially after the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] (1914–1915). Russian forces advanced into northeastern [[Anatolia]] and controlled the major cities there until retreating from World War I with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] following the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917.

=====Genocides=====
{{main|Late Ottoman genocides|Armenian genocide|Greek genocide|Seyfo}}
In 1915 the Ottoman government and Kurdish tribes in region started the extermination of its ethnic Armenian population, resulting in the death of up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Armenians in the [[Armenian genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bijak |first1=Jakub |last2=Lubman |first2=Sarah |title=The Armenian Genocide Legacy |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-137-56163-3 |page=39 |language=en |chapter=The Disputed Numbers: In Search of the Demographic Basis for Studies of Armenian Population Losses, 1915–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Balakian|title=The Burning Tigris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrYoyAM3PBYC&amp;pg=PR17|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-186017-1|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on [[death march]]es leading to the [[Syrian desert]].

=====Arab Revolt=====
{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Arab Revolt}}
The [[Arab Revolt]] began in 1916 with British support. It turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. On the basis of the [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]], an agreement between the British government and [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca]], the revolt was officially initiated at Mecca on 10 June 1916.{{refn|group=note|Although his sons [[Ali of Hejaz|'Ali]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] had already initiated operations at Medina starting on 5 June&lt;ref&gt;Eliezer Tauber, ''The Arab Movements in World War I,''  Routledge, 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-135-19978-4}} p =80-81&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Arab nationalist goal was to create a single unified and independent [[Arab state]] stretching from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in [[Yemen]], which the British had promised to recognise.

The [[Sharifian Army]] led by Hussein and the [[Hashemites]], with military backing from the British [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], successfully fought and expelled the Ottoman military presence from much of the [[Hejaz]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. The rebellion eventually took [[Damascus]] and set up a short-lived monarchy led by [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]], a son of Hussein.

Following the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], the Middle East was later partitioned by the British and French into [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territories]]. There was no unified Arab state, much to the anger of Arab nationalists.

=====Treaty of Sèvres and Turkish War of Independence=====
[[File:Sultanvahideddin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mehmed VI]], the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, leaving the country after the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate, 17 November 1922]]
Defeated on every front, the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Armistice of Mudros]] on 30 October 1918. [[Occupation of Constantinople|Constantinople was occupied]] by combined British, French, Italian, and Greek forces. In May 1919, Greece also [[occupation of İzmir|took control of the area around Smyrna]] (now İzmir).

The [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]] was finalised under the terms of the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. This treaty, as designed in the [[Conference of London (1920)|Conference of London]], allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The status of Anatolia was problematic given the occupied forces.

There arose a nationalist opposition in the [[Turkish national movement]]. It won the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–23) under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] (later given the surname "Atatürk"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, [[Mehmed VI]] (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] was [[History of Turkey#Republic of Turkey|established]] in its place on 29 October 1923, in the new capital city of [[Ankara]]. The [[Ottoman Caliphate|caliphate]] was abolished on 3 March 1924.&lt;ref name="Ozoglu"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hakan Özoğlu|title=From Caliphate to Secular State: Power Struggle in the Early Turkish Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cw5V1c1ej_cC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37957-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiographical debate on the Ottoman state ==
{{main|Ghaza thesis}}
Several historians such as British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] and the Greek historian [[Dimitri Kitsikis]] have argued that after the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Byzantine (Roman) state and that in essence, the Ottoman Empire was a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] guise.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Stone, "Turkey in the Russian Mirror" pp. 86–100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark &amp; Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: London, 2004 pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Speros Vryonis]] wrote that the Ottoman state was centered on "a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the [[Turkish language]] and the [[Islam]]ic religion".&lt;ref name="Stone, pp. 86-100"&gt;Stone, pp. 86–100&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Heath Lowry]] and Kitsikis posit that the early Ottoman state was predatory confederacy open to both Byzantine Christians and Turkish Muslims, whose primary goal was attaining booty and slaves, rather than spreading Islam, and that only later Islam became the primary characteristic of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Heath W. Lowry, ''The nature of the early Ottoman state'' (SUNY Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dariusz Kołodziejczyk,  "Khan, caliph, tsar and imperator: the multiple identities of the Ottoman sultan" in Peter Fibiger Bang, and Dariusz Kolodziejczyk, eds. ''Universal Empire: A Comparative Approach to Imperial Culture and Representation in Eurasian History'' (Cambridge UP, 2012) pp. 175–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinan Ed Kuneralp, ed. ''A Bridge Between Cultures'' (2006) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian [[Paul Wittek]] who emphasised the Islamic character of the early Ottoman state, seeing the Ottoman state as a "[[Jihad]] state" dedicated to expanding the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Stone, pp. 86-100"/&gt; Many historians led in 1937 by the Turkish historian [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü]] championed the ''[[Ghazi thesis]]'' that saw the early Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale. They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald C.  Jennings, "Some thoughts on the gazi-thesis." ''Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes'' 76 (1986): 151–161 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23868782 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The British historian [[Norman Stone]] suggested many continuities between the Eastern Roman and Ottoman empires such as the ''zeugarion'' tax of Byzantium becoming the Ottoman ''Resm-i çift'' tax, the ''[[pronoia]]'' land-holding system that linked the amount of land one owned with one's ability to raise cavalry becoming the Ottoman ''[[timar]]'' system, and the Ottoman measurement for land the ''dönüm'' was the same as the Byzantine ''stremma''. Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to [[Sufism]] and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism is the correct way to reach God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Yılmaz|first=Hüseyin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvbWDgAAQBAJ|title=Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought|date=2018-01-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8804-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the matters of jurisprudence and shariah were state matters, the state sponsored Sufi religious dominance came into play. Non-Sufi Muslims and Arabs were neglected and not given any position in the Hejaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emaanlibrary.com/book/the-uthmani-state-shaykh-nasir-al-fahd/|title=The Uthmani State – Shaykh Nasir al-Fahd – E M A A N L I B R A R Y .

{{Main|State organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Jean Baptiste Vanmour - Dinner at the Palace in Honour of an Ambassador - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Ambassadors at the [[Topkapı Palace]]]]

Before the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]] was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic [[Iran]] remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p = 38}} According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of [[Sunni|orthodox]] Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Kapucu"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC|access-date=11 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC/page/n71 77]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire, or as a dynastic institution, the House of Osman, was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nspmqLKPU-wC&amp;pg=PA199|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93243-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, only the [[House of Habsburg]] had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.&lt;ref name="Kapucu"/&gt; As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918–1922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparalleled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world. The primary purpose of the [[Imperial Harem]] was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the Ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal (male-line) descendance of the Ottoman sultans.

[[File:Istanbul_asv2020-02_img15_Topkapı_Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Inside Harem, the private residence of the sultan in [[Topkapı Palace]]]]

The highest position in Islam, ''[[caliphate]]'', was claimed by the sultans starting with [[Murad I]],&lt;ref name="Lambton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lambton |first1=Ann |author-link1=Ann Lambton |last2=Lewis |first2=Bernard |author-link2=Bernard Lewis |title=The Cambridge History of Islam: The Indian sub-continent, South-East Asia, Africa and the Muslim west |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AuJvd2Tyt8C |page=320 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-521-22310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established as the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, ''[[Padishah|pâdişâh]]'' or "lord of kings", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the [[Valide Sultan]]. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the "[[Sultanate of the women|Sultanate of Women]]". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan.{{dubious|reason= this is demonstrably not true, just look at any list of sultans |date=September 2016}} The strong educational system of the [[palace school]] was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the [[Madrasa]] (''{{lang|ota|Medrese}}'') was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=Istanbul and the Civilization of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://archive.org/details/istanbulciviliza00bern|url-access=registration|access-date=11 February 2013|year=1963|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-1060-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/istanbulciviliza00bern/page/151 151]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second track was a free [[boarding school]] for the Christians, the ''[[Enderûn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ottoman Palace School Enderun and the Man with Multiple Talents, Matrakçı Nasuh|journal=Journal of the Korea Society of Mathematical Education, Series D|date=March 2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=19–31|url=https://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/471488/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh|series=Research in Mathematical Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in [[Rumelia]] or the Balkans, a process known as [[Devshirme in the Ottoman Palace School|Devshirme]] (''{{lang|ota|Devşirme}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karpat|first=Kemal H.|title=Social Change and Politics in Turkey: A Structural-Historical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlhD9SjavRcC&amp;pg=PA204|year=1973|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-03817-2|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the sultan was the supreme monarch, the sultan's political and executive authority was delegated. The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.&lt;ref name="Black p199"/&gt;

Throughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces. The representatives formed the [[Imperial Government of the Ottoman Empire]].

This eclectic administration was apparent even in the diplomatic correspondence of the Empire, which was initially undertaken in the [[Greek language]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC|access-date=12 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC/page/n72 78]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tughra]] were calligraphic monograms, or signatures, of the Ottoman Sultans, of which there were 35. Carved on the Sultan's seal, they bore the names of the Sultan and his father. The statement and prayer, "ever victorious", was also present in most. The earliest belonged to Orhan Gazi. The ornately stylised ''Tughra'' spawned a branch of Ottoman-Turkish [[calligraphy]].

=== Law ===
{{Main|Ottoman law}}
The Ottoman legal system accepted the [[religious law]] over its subjects. At the same time the ''[[Qanun (law)|Qanun]]'' (or ''Kanun''), a secular legal system, co-existed with religious law or [[Sharia]].&lt;ref name=otmkanun&gt;{{cite web|title=Balancing Sharia: The Ottoman Kanun|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/24365067|publisher=BBC|access-date=5 October 2013|archive-date=9 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009012204/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/24365067|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire was always organised around a system of local [[jurisprudence]]. Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority.&lt;ref name="Benton 109-110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Lauren|title=Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History, 1400–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZtjR9JnwYwC&amp;pg=109|access-date=11 February 2013|date=3 December 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00926-3|pages=109–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]].&lt;ref name="Benton 109-110"/&gt; The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups.&lt;ref name="Benton 109-110"/&gt; The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the "trade court". The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative ''Qanun'', i.e., laws, a system based upon the Turkic ''[[Yassa]]'' and ''[[Töre (law)|Töre]]'', which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|An Ottoman trial, 1877]]

These court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive; for instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Hadīth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijmā']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs. Both systems were taught at the Empire's law schools, which were in [[Istanbul]] and [[Bursa]].

[[File:Zibik.jpg|thumb|upright|An unhappy wife complains to the [[Qadi]] about her husband's impotence as depicted in an [[Ottoman miniature]]]]

The Ottoman Islamic legal system was set up differently from traditional European courts. Presiding over Islamic courts would be a ''Qadi'', or judge. Since the closing of the ''[[ijtihad]]'', or ''Gate of Interpretation, Qadis ''throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent, and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered.&lt;ref name="Benton 109-110"/&gt; However, the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure, leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favour.

In the late 19th century, the Ottoman legal system saw substantial reform. This process of legal modernisation began with the [[Edict of Gülhane]] of 1839.&lt;ref name="review-niza"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of "Ottoman Nizamiye Courts. Law and Modernity"|url=http://research.sabanciuniv.edu/19475/1/Avi_Rubin_Ottoman_Nizamiye_Courts_Somel.pdf|publisher=Sabancı Üniversitesi|author=Selçuk Akşin Somel|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms included the "fair and public trial[s] of all accused regardless of religion", the creation of a system of "separate competences, religious and civil", and the validation of testimony on non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="int-handbook"/&gt; Specific land codes (1858), civil codes (1869–1876), and a code of civil procedure also were enacted.&lt;ref name="int-handbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Middle East |url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/MiddleEast.pdf |work=Legal Traditions and Systems: an International Handbook |publisher=Greenwood Press |last1=Epstein |first1=Lee |last2=O'Connor |first2=Karen |last3=Grub |first3=Diana |pages=223–24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525015655/http://epstein.usc.edu/research/MiddleEast.pdf |archive-date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reforms were based heavily on French models, as indicated by the adoption of a three-tiered court system. Referred to as [[Nizamiye]], this system was extended to the local magistrate level with the final promulgation of the [[Mecelle]], a civil code that regulated marriage, divorce, alimony, will, and other matters of personal status.&lt;ref name="int-handbook"/&gt; In an attempt to clarify the division of judicial competences, an administrative council laid down that religious matters were to be handled by religious courts, and statute matters were to be handled by the Nizamiye courts.&lt;ref name="int-handbook"/&gt;

The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organised by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century. The military system became an intricate organisation with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included Janissary, [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Akıncı]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehterân]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]]. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour, using bows and short swords on fast [[Turkoman horse|Turkoman]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] horses (progenitors of the [[Thoroughbred#Foundation stallions|Thoroughbred]] racing horse),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milner|first=Mordaunt|title=The Godolphin Arabian: The Story of the Matchem Line|year=1990|publisher=Robert Hale Limited|isbn=978-0-85131-476-1|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wall|first=John F|title=Famous Running Horses: Their Forebears and Descendants|isbn=978-1-163-19167-5|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often applied tactics similar to those of the [[Mongol Empire]], such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack. The Ottoman army continued to be an effective fighting force throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphey |first=Rhoads |title=Ottoman Warfare, 1500–1700 |date=1999 |publisher=UCL Press |page=10}}

The modernisation of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century started with the military. In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-ı Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.

The [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of Greece in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (reigned 1861–1876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France. The shipyard at Barrow, England, built its first [[submarine]] in 1886 for the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="first submarine at shipyard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellesmereportstandard.co.uk/latest-north-west-news/Petition-created-for-submarine-name.4001190.jp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423225019/http://www.ellesmereportstandard.co.uk/latest-north-west-news/Petition-created-for-submarine-name.4001190.jp |archive-date=23 April 2008 |title=Petition created for submarine name |work=Ellesmere Port Standard|access-date=11 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman Navy at the Golden Horn.jpg|thumb|left|A German postcard depicting the [[Ottoman Navy]] at the [[Golden Horn]] in the early stages of [[World War I]]. At top left is a portrait of Sultan [[Mehmed V]].]]

However, the collapsing Ottoman economy could not sustain the fleet's strength for long. Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]] and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years. Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Committee of Union and Progress sought to develop a strong Ottoman naval force. The ''Ottoman Navy Foundation'' was established in 1910 to buy new ships through public donations.

The establishment of [[Ottoman Air Force|Ottoman military aviation]] dates back to between June 1909 and July 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkeyswar.com/aviation/aviation.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512225046/http://www.turkeyswar.com/aviation/aviation.htm |archive-date=12 May 2012 |title=Story of Turkish Aviation |publisher=Turkey in the First World War |access-date=6 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/EN/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=19 |title=Founding |publisher=Turkish Air Force |access-date=6 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007104345/http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/EN/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=19 |archive-date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire started preparing its first pilots and planes, and with the founding of the Aviation School (''Tayyare Mektebi'') in [[Yeşilköy]] on 3 July 1912, the Empire began to tutor its own flight officers. The founding of the Aviation School quickened advancement in the military aviation program, increased the number of enlisted persons within it, and gave the new pilots an active role in the Ottoman Army and Navy. In May 1913, the world's first specialised Reconnaissance Training Program was started by the Aviation School, and the first separate reconnaissance division was established.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} In June 1914 a new military academy, the Naval Aviation School (''Bahriye Tayyare Mektebi'') was founded. With the outbreak of World War I, the modernisation process stopped abruptly. The [[Aviation Squadrons (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman aviation squadrons]] fought on many fronts during World War I, from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the west to the Caucasus in the east and [[Yemen]] in the south.

Ottoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of Bursa, Edirne, and Istanbul, successive Ottoman capitals, into major commercial and industrial centres, considering that merchants and artisans were indispensable in creating a new metropolis.&lt;ref name="Inalcik1970209"&gt;{{cite book |last=İnalcık |first=Halil |author-link=Halil İnalcık |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=M.

In many places in Europe, Jews were suffering persecution at the hands of their Christian counterparts, such as in Spain, after the conclusion of Reconquista. The tolerance displayed by the Turks was welcomed by the immigrants.

The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous.&lt;ref name="Inalcik1970217"&gt;{{cite book |last=İnalcık |first=Halil |author-link=Halil İnalcık |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=M.

The Ottoman economy greatly expanded during the early modern period, with particularly high growth rates during the first half of the eighteenth century. The empire's annual income quadrupled between 1523 and 1748, adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darling |first=Linda |title=Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy: Tax Collection and Finance Administration in the Ottoman Empire, 1560–1660. |publisher=E.J.

Modern Ottoman studies indicate that the change in relations between the Ottoman Turks and central Europe was caused by the opening of the new sea routes. It is possible to see the decline in the significance of the land routes to the East as Western Europe opened the ocean routes that bypassed the Middle East and Mediterranean as parallel to the decline of the Ottoman Empire itself.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Quataert, ''The Ottoman Empire 1700–1922'' (2005) p 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2016}} The [[Anglo-Ottoman Treaty]], also known as the [[Treaty of Balta Liman]] that opened the Ottoman markets directly to English and French competitors, would be seen as one of the staging posts along this development.

By developing commercial centres and routes, encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions, the state performed basic economic functions in the Empire. But in all this, the financial and political interests of the state were dominant. Within the social and political system they were living in, Ottoman administrators could not see the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Inalcik1970218"&gt;{{cite book |last=İnalcık |first=Halil |author-link=Halil İnalcık |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=M.

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] argues that [[free trade]] contributed to [[deindustrialisation]] in the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to the [[protectionism]] of China, Japan, and Spain, the Ottoman Empire had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal trade]] policy, open to foreign imports. This has origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673 and 1740, which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists, such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but later criticised by British politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=Paul Bairoch|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32|author-link=Paul Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520–1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5.&lt;ref name="Kabadayı"/&gt; For unclear reasons, the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Population Rise and Fall in Anatolia 1550–1620|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=October 1979|volume=15|issue=3|pages=322–45|author=Leila Erder and Suraiya Faroqhi|doi=10.1080/00263207908700415}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount, as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts.&lt;ref name="Kabadayı"/&gt;

Censuses of Ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century. Figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results, but the censuses did not cover the whole population.

However, it began to rise to reach 25–32&amp;nbsp;million by 1800, with around 10&amp;nbsp;million in the European provinces (primarily in the Balkans), 11&amp;nbsp;million in the Asiatic provinces, and around 3&amp;nbsp;million in the African provinces.

Towards the end of the empire's existence life expectancy was 49 years, compared to the mid-twenties in Serbia at the beginning of the 19th century.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 112}} Epidemic diseases and famine caused major disruption and demographic changes. In 1785 around one-sixth of the Egyptian population died from plague and Aleppo saw its population reduced by twenty per cent in the 18th century. Six famines hit Egypt alone between 1687 and 1731 and the last famine to hit Anatolia was four decades later.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 113}}

The rise of port cities saw the clustering of populations caused by the development of steamships and railroads. Urbanization increased from 1700 to 1922, with towns and cities growing. Improvements in health and sanitation made them more attractive to live and work in. Port cities like Salonica, in Greece, saw its population rise from 55,000 in 1800 to 160,000 in 1912 and İzmir which had a population of 150,000 in 1800 grew to 300,000 by 1914.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 114}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pamuk|first=S|title=The Ottoman Empire and the World Economy: The Nineteenth Century|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|date=August 1991|volume=23|issue=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions conversely had population falls—Belgrade saw its population drop from 25,000 to 8,000 mainly due to political strife.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 114}}

Economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire. For example, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Austria-Habsburg annexation of the Crimean and Balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of Muslim refugees—200,000 Crimean Tartars fleeing to Dobruja.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p=115}} Between 1783 and 1913, approximately 5–7&amp;nbsp;million refugees flooded into the Ottoman Empire, at least 3.8&amp;nbsp;million of whom were from Russia. Some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire (e.g., Turkey and Bulgaria), whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories, simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations. Economies were also impacted with the loss of artisans, merchants, manufacturers and agriculturists.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p=116}} Since the 19th century, a large proportion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans emigrated to present-day Turkey.

Turkic peoples practised a variety of [[shamanism]] before adopting Islam. [[Abbasid]] influence in Central Asia was ensured through a process that was greatly facilitated by the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]]. Many of the various Turkic tribes—including the [[Oghuz Turks]], who were the ancestors of both the Seljuks and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam, and brought the religion with them to Anatolia beginning in the 11th century. Since the founding of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottomans followed the [[Maturidi]] [[Islamic theology|creed]] (school of Islamic theology) and the [[Hanafi]] [[madhab]] (school of Islamic jurisprudence).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4BXsV0_qhs4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg#v Change And Essence: Dialectical Relations Between Change And Continuity in the Turkish Intellectual Traditions] Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Change.

Under the {{lang|tr|millet}} system, non-Muslim people were considered subjects of the Empire but were not subject to the Muslim faith or Muslim law. The Orthodox millet, for instance, was still officially legally subject to [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]], which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years. Also, as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects (or {{lang|ota|dhimmi}}) of the Islamic Ottoman state, the Orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce, and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Krummerich.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610014150/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Krummerich.htm |archive-date=10 June 2009 |title=The Divinely-Protected, Well-Flourishing Domain: The Establishment of the Ottoman System in the Balkan Peninsula |first=Sean |last=Krummerich |journal=The Student Historical Journal |volume=30 |year=1998–99 |publisher=Loyola University New Orleans |access-date=11 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/ottoman/turkish.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010320091629/http://globaled.org/nyworld/materials/ottoman/turkish.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 March 2001 |title=Turkish Toleration |publisher=The American Forum for Global Education |access-date=11 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society, government and religion was inter-related in complex ways after about 1800, in a complex overlapping, inefficient system that Atatürk systematically dismantled after 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Philip D.

Religious officials formed the Ulama, who had control of religious teachings and theology, and also the Empire's judicial system, giving them a major voice in day-to-day affairs in communities across the Empire (but not including the non-Muslim millets). They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan [[Selim III]]. His successor Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808–1839) first won ulama approval before proposing similar reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal H. Karpat, "The transformation of the Ottoman State, 1789–1908."

The caliphate was abolished, madrasas were closed down, and the sharia courts abolished. He replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin letters, ended the religious school system, and gave women some political rights. Many rural traditionalists never accepted this secularisation, and by the 1990s they were reasserting a demand for a larger role for Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amit Bein|title=Ottoman Ulema, Turkish Republic: Agents of Change and Guardians of Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1xfDfgPJr8C&amp;pg=PA141|year=2011|publisher=Stanford UP|page=141|isbn=978-0-8047-7311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Janissaries were a highly formidable military unit in the early years, but as Western Europe modernised its military organisation technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened, or outsiders wanted to modernise them, or they might be superseded by the cavalrymen, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Benesch,  "Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace." ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37–55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&amp;context=ccr Online].&lt;/ref&gt; The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who were a very powerful military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt, executed the leaders, and disbanded the large organisation. That set the stage for a slow process of modernisation of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology.

The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire. The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into a Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning. The large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called millets.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, "The Ottoman millet system: Non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy." ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24–42.&lt;/ref&gt; They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]]. In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881–1908'' (1083)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support. Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.&lt;ref&gt;Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56–100.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St._Anthony_of_Padua_Church_in_Istanbul_06.JPG|thumb|left|The original [[Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Istanbul]] was built in 1725 by the local Italian community of Istanbul, but was later demolished and replaced with the current building which was constructed on the same location.]]
At the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|"ayan"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gábor Ágoston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century, for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.

After the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism. The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the result that they came out as one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Although the predominant literary language of the Ottoman Empire was Turkish, Persian was preferred vehicle for the projection of an imperial image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Iranica|url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/historiography-xiv|title=HISTORIOGRAPHY xiv.

Agricultural slavery, such as that which was widespread in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of [[chattel slavery]], slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, and the children of female slaves were born legally free. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islam and slavery: Sexual slavery |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml |access-date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Ottoman literature}}

The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and [[prose]]. Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].

Ottoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualised and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير mura'ât-i nazîr / تناسب tenâsüb) and opposition (تضاد tezâd) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasîdes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnevî, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuzûlî]] and the [[Hüsn ü Aşk]] of [[Şeyh Gâlib]]. The [[Seyahatnâme]] of [[Evliya Çelebi]] (1611–1682) is an outstanding example of travel literature.

[[File:Nedim (divan edb.şairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Nedîm Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]

Until the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (سجع, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanlı'da kurumlar ve kültür |year=2005 |publisher=İstanbul Bilgi Üniversitesi Yayınları |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was [[Muhayyelât]] ("Fancies") by [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was by an Armenian named [[Vartan Pasha]]. Published in 1851, the novel was entitled The Story of Akabi (Turkish: Akabi Hikyayesi) and was written in Turkish but with [[Armenian language|Armenian]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mignon|first1=Laurent|title=Neither Shiraz nor Paris: papers on modern Turkish literature|date=2005|publisher=ISIS|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-975-428-303-7|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AbQZAQAAIAAJ|quote=Those words could have been readily adopted by Hovsep Vartanyan (1813–1879), the author, who preferred to remain anonymous, of The Story of Akabi (Akabi Hikyayesi), the first novel in Turkish, published with Armenian characters in the same year as [[Hovhannes Hisarian|Hisarian]]'s novel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masters|first1=Bruce|last2=Ágoston|first2=Gábor|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|date=2009|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|quote=Written in Turkish using the Armenian alphabet, the Akabi History (1851) by Vartan Pasha is considered by some to be the first Ottoman novel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pultar|first1=Gönül|title=Imagined identities : identity formation in the age of globalism|date=2013|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-8156-3342-6|page=329|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhiQAwAAQBAJ|quote=In fact, one of the first Turkish works of fiction in Western-type novel form, Akabi Hikayesi (Akabi's Story), was written in Turkish by Vartan Pasha (born Osep/Hovsep Vartanian/Vartanyan, 1813–1879) and published in Armenian characters in 1851.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gürçaglar |first1=Şehnaz |last2=Paker |first2=Saliha |last3=Milton |first3=John |date=2015 |title=Tradition, Tension and Translation in Turkey |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |page=5 |isbn=978-90-272-6847-1 |quote=It is interesting that the first Ottoman novel in Turkish, Akabi Hikayesi (1851, Akabi's Story), was written and published in Armenian letters (for Armenian communities who read in Turkish) by Hovsep Vartanyan (1813–1879), known as Vartan Paşa, a leading Ottoman man of letters and journalist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to historically close ties with France, [[French literature]] came to constitute the major Western influence on Ottoman literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents; in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.

Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously; for instance, the poet [[Namık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel İntibâh ("Awakening"), while the journalist [[İbrahim Şinasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy "Şair Evlenmesi" ("The Poet's Marriage"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled "Vakâyi'-i 'Acibe ve Havâdis-i Garibe-yi Kefşger Ahmed" ("The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr, 1873; "Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery"), Realism (Henüz on Yedi Yaşında, 1881; "Just Seventeen Years Old"), and Naturalism (Müşâhedât, 1891; "Observations"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalisation of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=Türk Romanına Eleştirel Bir Bakış Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}

[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however. During the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]], and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s, and tombs.

Examples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul&lt;!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--&gt; and [[Edirne]]&lt;!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--&gt;, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans, and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains, and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archive-date=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decorative arts ===
[[File:Topkapi_Sarayi_in_time_of_Selim_I_-_left.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ottoman miniature]] lost its function with the Westernization of Ottoman culture.]]
[[File:Selimiye_Mosque,_Dome.jpg|thumb|[[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]] calligraphy]]

The tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form, though it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.

[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.

The art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.&lt;ref name="foroqhi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-85043-760-4|page=152|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weaving of such carpets originated in the [[nomad]]ic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs, and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.&lt;ref name="foroqhip153"&gt;{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B. Tauris |location=London |isbn=978-1-85043-760-4 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music and performing arts ===
[[Ottoman classical music]] was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite. A number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.

The [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|bağlama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and—later in the tradition—Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian Türküs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) Türküs, Aegean Türküs, Central Anatolian Türküs, Eastern Anatolian Türküs, and Caucasian Türküs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].

The traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Karagöz and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |access-date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Emin Şenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |access-date=11 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131082003/http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |archive-date=31 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def''). Its origins are obscure, deriving perhaps from an older Egyptian tradition, or possibly from an Asian source.

[[Ottoman cuisine]] refers to the cuisine of the capital, [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared. This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yalı]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.

Much of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.&lt;ref name="Fragner"&gt;Bert Fragner, "From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[döner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cacık]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[köfte]]/keftés/kofta, [[börek]]/boureki, [[rakı]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[keşkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.

Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Ágoston and Alan Masters583"/&gt; A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century. [[Mehmet II|Sultan Mehmet II]] ordered [[Georgios Amiroutzes]], a Greek scholar from [[Trabzon]], to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of [[Ptolemy]]. Another example is [[Ali Qushji]] – an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] and [[Islamic physics|physicist]] originally from [[Samarkand]] – who became a professor in two madrasas and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years in Constantinople&lt;!--Here, use that instead of Istanbul--&gt; before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ragep |first1=F.
