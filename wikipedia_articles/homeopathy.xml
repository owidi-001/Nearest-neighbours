It was conceived in 1796 by the German physician [[Samuel Hahnemann]]. Its practitioners, called '''homeopaths''', believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people can cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called ''[[similia similibus curentur]]'', or "like cures like".&lt;ref name="Hahnemann"/&gt; Homeopathic preparations are termed ''remedies'' and are made using [[homeopathic dilution]]. In this process, the selected substance is repeatedly diluted until the final product is chemically indistinguishable from the diluent. Often not even a single molecule of the original substance can be expected to remain in the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rpharms.com/resources/quick-reference-guides/homeopathy|title=Homeopathy|website=[[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]|access-date=2019-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between each dilution homeopaths may hit and/or shake the product, claiming this makes the diluent remember the original substance after its removal. Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homeopathy/|title=Homeopathy|date=2017-10-18|website=nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. It was introduced to the United States in 1825 with the first homeopathic school opening in 1835. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States. During this period, homeopathy was able to appear relatively successful, as other forms of treatment could be harmful and ineffective. By the end of the century the practice began to wane, with the last exclusively homeopathic medical school in the US closing in 1920.

In the 1970s, homeopathy made a significant comeback, with sales of some homeopathic products increasing tenfold. The trend corresponded with the rise of the [[New Age movement]], and may be in part due to an [[appeal to nature|irrational preference for "natural" products]], and the longer consultation times homeopathic practitioners provided.

In the 21st century a series of meta-analyses have shown that the therapeutic claims of homeopathy lack scientific justification. As a result, national and international bodies have recommended the withdrawal of government funding for homeopathy in healthcare. National bodies from Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France, as well as the European Academies' Science Advisory Council and the Russian Academy of Sciences have all concluded that homeopathy is ineffective, and recommended against the practice receiving any further funding.&lt;ref name="Conversation-NHMRC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://theconversation.com/no-evidence-homeopathy-is-effective-nhmrc-review-25368 | title=No evidence homeopathy is effective: NHMRC review | work=The Conversation | date=April 8, 2014 | last=Musgrave|first=I | access-date=January 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Swiss make New Year's regulations |url = http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-make-new-year-s-regulations/31867422 |publisher = Swiss Info |access-date = December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homeopathic remedies are 'nonsense and risk significant harm' say 29 European scientific bodies|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/homeopathy-nonsense-risk-harm-29-european-academies-science-advisory-council-remedies-a7963786.html|access-date=October 10, 2017|newspaper=The Independent|date=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-02-07|title=Memorandum #2.

==History==
Homeopathy, the longest established [[alternative medicine]] to come out of Europe, was created in 1796 by [[Samuel Hahnemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loudon|first=Irvine|date=December 2006|title=A brief history of homeopathy|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=99|issue=12|pages=607–610|doi=10.1177/014107680609901206|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1676328|pmid=17139061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann rejected the mainstream medicine of the late 18th century as irrational and inadvisable because it was largely ineffective and often harmful.&lt;ref name=Lasagna&gt;

===Concept===
[[File:Samuel Hahnemann Monument, Scott Circle.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Hahnemann Monument]], Washington, D.C., with the inscription ''Similia Similibus Curentur'' – "Like cures Like"]]
Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into German. Being sceptical of Cullen's theory that [[cinchona]] cured [[malaria]] because it was bitter, Hahnemann ingested some bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and [[arthralgia|joint pain]]: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat.&lt;ref name="UllmanReichenberg-Ullman1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert W. Ullman|author2=Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman|title=The patient's guide to homeopathic medicine |url=https://archive.org/details/patientsguidetoh00robe |url-access=registration|access-date=January 24, 2013|date=October 1, 1994|publisher=Picnic Point Press|isbn=978-0-9640654-2-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/patientsguidetoh00robe/page/1 1]–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the name ''"homeopathy"'', which comes from the {{lang-grc-gre|ὅμοιος}} ''hómoios'', "-like" and {{lang|el|πάθος}} ''páthos'', "suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Merrell|first1=Woodson C.|last2=Shalts|first2=Edward|date=2002|title=Homeopathy|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11795090/|journal=The Medical Clinics of North America|volume=86|issue=1|pages=47–62|doi=10.1016/s0025-7125(03)00071-3|issn=0025-7125|pmid=11795090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine that those drugs are effective which produce symptoms similar to the symptoms caused by the diseases they treat, called "the law of similars", was expressed by Hahnemann with the Latin phrase ''[[similia similibus curentur]]'', or "like cures like".&lt;ref name="Hahnemann" /&gt; Hahnemann's law of similars is unproven and does not derive from the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Kirk"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1894|editor2=John Hugh McQuillen|editor3=George Jacob Ziegler|editor4=James William White|editor5=Edward Cameron Kirk|editor6=Lovick Pierce Anthony|title=A wail from the waste-basket|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dencos/acf8385.0036.001/1050:349?didno=ACF8385.0036.001;rgn=full+text;view=image|journal=[[The Dental Cosmos]]|type=editorial|volume=36|issue=12|pages=1030–32|editor=J.

Hahnemann began to test what effects various substances may produce in humans, a procedure later called "homeopathic proving". These tests required subjects to test the effects of ingesting substances by recording all their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.&lt;ref name="Haehl1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Haehl|title=Samuel Hahnemann: His Life and Work : Based on Recently Discovered State Papers, Documents, Letters, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q80gR6OxDVsC&amp;pg=PA101|access-date=January 24, 2013|year=1922|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-7021-693-3|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a collection of provings in 1805, and a second collection of 65 preparations appeared in his book, ''Materia Medica Pura'' (1810).&lt;ref name="Kirschmann2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Taylor Kirschmann|title=A vital force: women in American homeopathy |url=https://archive.org/details/vitalforcewomeni0000kirs|url-access=registration|access-date=January 28, 2013|year=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3320-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/vitalforcewomeni0000kirs/page/11 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated for extreme dilutions. A technique was devised for making dilutions that Hahnemann claimed would preserve the substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Dynamization and Dilution"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynamization and dilution |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine |publisher=[[Creighton University]] Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826082134/http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archive-date=August 26, 2002 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann believed that this process enhanced "the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances".&lt;ref name="Organon_5th_269"&gt;{{cite book |author      =Hahnemann S |title       =The organon of the healing art |year        =1833 |edition     =5th |at          =aphorism 269 |isbn        =978-0-87983-228-5}}.

====Miasms and disease====
In the ''Organon'', Hahnemann introduced the concept of "miasms" as the "infectious principles" underlying chronic disease&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2001"&gt;{{cite book |author= John Henry Clarke |title= Homeopathy explained |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUGIWuo4qc8C&amp;pg=PA22 |access-date=January 12, 2013 |date=January 1, 2001 |publisher= Nanopathy |pages=22–|id= GGKEY:JWCD56EF80T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "peculiar morbid derangement[s] of vital force".&lt;ref name="Grimes2012"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, and thought that initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases. His assertion was that if these symptoms were suppressed by medication, the cause went deeper and began to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.&lt;ref name="miasms" /&gt; Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly [[Symptomatic treatment|alleviating their symptoms]], as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all "disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency".&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann's [[hypotheses]] for miasms originally presented only three local symptoms: psora (the itch), syphilis (venereal disease) or sycosis (fig-wart disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Homoeopathy |volume=13 |page=645 |first=William Tod |last=Helmuth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these the most important was ''psora'', described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin and was claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed it to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name="Hahnemann_Chronic"&gt;

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as [[genetics]], environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=JW |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it really works |url=https://archive.org/details/homeopathyhowitr0000shel |url-access=registration |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148–9|date=November 2012}}

Because medical practice of the time relied on treatments which were often ineffective and harmful, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those being treated by medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="pmid8885813"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ernst |first1=E. |last2=Kaptchuk |first2=TJ |title=Homeopathy revisited |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=156 |issue=19 |pages=2162–4 |year=1996 |pmid=8885813 |doi=10.1001/archinte.156.19.2162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ineffective, homeopathic preparations are rarely detrimental, thus users are less likely to be harmed by the treatment that is supposed to be helping them.&lt;ref name="homhist1" /&gt; The relative success of homeopathy in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of [[bloodletting]] and purging and begun the move towards more effective, [[science-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="kaufmanm"&gt;

Even during its rise in popularity, homeopathy was criticized by scientists and physicians. [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]], physician to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], said in 1843 that the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless and considered it "an outrage to human reason".&lt;ref name="John_Forbes"&gt;

According to academics {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul U.

Some homeopaths credit for the revival to Greek homeopath [[George Vithoulkas]], who conducted a "great deal of research to update the scenarios and refine the theories and practice of homeopathy" in the 1970s,&lt;ref name="pmid12614092"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 138 | issue = 5 | pages = 393–99 | last = Jonas | first = WB |author2=TJ Kaptchuk |author3=K Linde | title = A critical overview of homeopathy. | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | year = 2003 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-138-5-200303040-00009|pmid=12614092| s2cid = 22787732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Andrew | last = Lockie | title = Encyclopedia of Homeopathy | url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediahome00lock_433 | url-access = limited | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | year = 2000 | location = New York | edition = 1st | page = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediahome00lock_433/page/n20 19] | isbn = 978-0-7566-1871-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ernst and [[Simon Singh]] consider it to be linked to the rise of the [[New Age movement]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-393-06661-4" /&gt; [[Bruce Hood (psychologist)|Bruce Hood]] has argued that the increased popularity of homeopathy in recent times may be due to the comparatively long consultations practitioners are willing to give their patients, and to a [[appeal to nature|preference for "natural" products]], which people think are the basis of homeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name="Hood2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

Towards the end of the century opposition to homeopathy began to increase again; with [[William T.

Royal S. Copeland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William T. Jarvis|author-link=William T. Jarvis|title=Response to Isadora Stehlin "Homeopathy: real medicine or empty promises?"

Since the beginning of the 21st century, a series of [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] have further shown that the therapeutic claims of homeopathy lack scientific justification.&lt;ref name="champe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crockett |first1=Chambers |title=Death by homeopathy: issues for civil, criminal and coronial law and for health service policy |pmid=22558899 |journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=454–78 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had led to a decrease or suspension of funding by many governments.

Homeopathic preparations are referred to as "homeopathic remedies".&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 21, 2015 |title=Homeopathic drugs: No better than placebos? |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/homeopathic-drugs-no-better-than-placebos/2015/12/18/037b3976-7750-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html |access-date=December 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing: ''[[Materia medica]]'' and repertories. A homeopathic ''materia medica'' is a collection of "drug pictures", organized alphabetically. A homeopathic repertory is a quick reference version of the ''materia medica'' that indexes the symptoms and then the associated remedies for each. In both cases different compilers may dispute particular inclusions in the references.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas: Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. (c) 2005, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; The first symptomatic homeopathic ''materia medica'' was arranged by Hahnemann. The first homeopathic repertory was Georg Jahr's ''Symptomenkodex'', published in German in 1835, and translated into English as the ''Repertory to the more Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica'' in 1838. This version was less focused on disease categories and was the forerunner to later works by [[James Tyler Kent]].&lt;ref name="pmid16322800"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellavite|first1=Paolo|last2=Conforti|first2=Anita|last3=Piasere|first3=Valeria|last4=Ortolani|first4=Riccardo|year=2005|title=Immunology and Homeopathy. 1.

=== Consultation ===
Homeopaths generally begin with a consultation, which can be a 10-15 minute appointment or last for over an hour, where the patient describes their [[medical history]]. The patient describes the "modalities", or if their symptoms change depending on the weather and other external factors.&lt;ref name="Vickers 1115–11182"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vickers|first1=Andrew|last2=Zollman|first2=Catherine|date=1999-10-23|title=Homoeopathy|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=319|issue=7217|pages=1115–1118|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7217.1115|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1116906|pmid=10531108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner also solicits information on mood, likes and dislikes, physical, mental and emotional states, life circumstances, and any physical or emotional illnesses.&lt;ref name="Stehlin"&gt;

In classical homeopathy, the practitioner attempts to match a single preparation to the totality of symptoms (the ''simlilum''), while "clinical homeopathy" involves combinations of preparations based on the illness's symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid12614092" /&gt;

=== Preparation ===
[[File:Ambalaj Oscillococcinum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Oscillococcinum]]'', a homeopathic remedy in pill form]]Homeopathy uses animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its preparations, generally referring to them using [[Latin]] names.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Safety issues in the preparation of homeopathic medicines|url=https://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Homeopathy.pdf|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''[[arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster snake]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]). Homeopaths say this is to ensure accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FAQs|url=https://www.theaahp.org/consumer-information/faqs/|access-date=2020-08-31|website=The American Association of Homeopathic Pharmacists|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA the common name must be displayed, although the Latin one can also be present.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Homeopathic pills are made from an inert substance (often sugars, typically lactose), upon which a drop of liquid homeopathic preparation is placed and allowed to evaporate.&lt;ref name="Ernst2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=E|year=2005|title=Is homeopathy a clinically valuable approach?|url=http://www.dcscience.net/ernst-tips-sept-2005.pdf|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|volume=26|issue=11|pages=547–48|citeseerx=10.1.1.385.5505|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2005.09.003|pmid=16165225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sagar|first1=SM|year=2007|title=Homeopathy: Does a teaspoon of honey help the medicine go down?|journal=Current Oncology|volume=14|issue=4|pages=126–27|doi=10.3747/co.2007.150|pmc=1948865|pmid=17710203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy in which the preparations come from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.&lt;ref name="pmid16322800" /&gt; They are called nosodes (from the Greek ''nosos'', disease) with preparations made from "healthy" specimens being termed "sarcodes".

Some modern homeopaths use preparations they call "imponderables" because they do not originate from a substance but some other phenomenon presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or [[lactose]].&lt;!--See next two sources, and the rest of the journal issue they came from for more information--&gt; Examples include [[X-ray]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Other minority practices include paper preparations, in which the terms for substances and dilutions are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients. [[Radionics]], the use of [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[radio wave]]s, can also be used to manufacture preparations. Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;

Three main [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] dilution scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the "centesimal" or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. There is also a decimal dilution scale (notated as "X" or "D") in which the preparation is diluted by a factor of 10 at each stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp|title=Homeopathic Medicine Potency or Dilution|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821064849/http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp|archive-date=August 21, 2015|access-date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centesimal scale was favoured by Hahnemann for most of his life, although in his last ten years Hahnemann developed a quintamillesimal (Q) scale which diluted the drug 1 part in 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=U.

In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01% ([[Concentration#Volume-volume percentage|volume-volume percentage]]). A 6C dilution ends up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; (one part in one trillion).

Critics of homeopathy commonly emphasize the dilutions involved in homeopathy, using analogies.&lt;ref name="Appendix2"&gt;For further discussion of homeopathic dilutions and the mathematics involved, see [[Homeopathic dilutions]].&lt;/ref&gt; One mathematically correct example is that a 12C solution is equivalent to "a pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans".&lt;ref name="Bambridge"&gt;

The volunteers were then observed, often for months at a time. They were made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Thomas Lindsley|title=The Life and Letters of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann|date=1895|publisher=Boericke &amp; Tafel|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1330001509|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofdrs00brad/page/103 103]–04|url=https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofdrs00brad|access-date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first Hahnemann used undiluted doses for provings, but he later advocated provings with preparations at a 30C dilution,&lt;ref name="Organon_6th_128" /&gt; and most modern provings are carried out using ultra-dilute preparations.&lt;ref&gt;

Provings are claimed to have been important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of "[[water memory]]", according to which water "remembers" the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed.

Practitioners also hold that higher dilutions produce stronger medicinal effects. This idea is also inconsistent with observed dose-response relationships, where effects are dependent on the concentration of the active ingredient in the body.&lt;ref name="Levy2" /&gt;  Some contend that the phenomenon of [[hormesis]] may support the idea of dilution increasing potency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Oberbaum, M|author2=Singer, SR|author3=Samuels, N.|date=Jul 2010|title=Hormesis and homeopathy: bridge over troubled waters|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|volume=29|issue=7|pages=567–71|doi=10.1177/0960327110369777|pmid=20558608|s2cid=8107797}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khuda‐Bukhsh|first1=Anisur Rahman|date=2003|title=Towards understanding molecular mechanisms of action of homeopathic drugs: an overview|journal=Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry|volume=253|issue=1/2|pages=339–45|doi=10.1023/A:1026048907739|pmid=14619985|s2cid=10971539}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the dose-response relationship outside the zone of hormesis declines with dilution as normal, and nonlinear pharmacological effects do not provide any credible support for homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, Kevin|date=April 2012|title=Homeopathy is unscientific and unethical|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1035885|journal=Bioethics|volume=26|issue=9|pages=508–12|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01956.x|s2cid=143067523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Patients may also receive standard medical care at the same time as homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement.
|-
| Cessation of unpleasant treatment
| Often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient.

Some homeopathic preparations involve poisons such as [[Atropa belladonna|Belladonna]], [[arsenic]], and [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]]. In rare cases, the original ingredients are present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Serious adverse effects such as seizures and death have been reported or associated with some homeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name="sr2012" /&gt; Instances of [[arsenic poisoning]] have occurred.&lt;ref name="pmid14705842" /&gt;  In 2009, the FDA advised consumers to stop using three discontinued cold remedy [[Zicam]] products because it could cause permanent damage to users' sense of smell.&lt;ref&gt;Sources:

==Regulation and prevalence==
{{Main|Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
[[File:Bristol Homeopathic.jpg|thumb|Hampton House, the former site of [[Bristol Homeopathic Hospital]].]]

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. It is practiced worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2001|title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/h2943e/h2943e.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927001352/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/h2943e/h2943e.pdf|archive-date=September 27, 2009|access-date=2020-09-01|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 WHO report found that 100 out of 133 Member States surveyed in 2012 acknowledged that their population used homeopathy, with 22 saying the practice was regulated and 13 providing health insurance coverage.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|date=4 June 2019|title=WHO global report on traditional and complementary medicine 2019|url=https://www.who.int/traditional-complementary-integrative-medicine/WhoGlobalReportOnTraditionalAndComplementaryMedicine2019.pdf?ua=1|access-date=2020-09-04|website=WHO|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In 2001 homeopathy had been integrated into the national health care systems of many countries, including India, Mexico, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Prevalence ===

Homeopathy is one of the most commonly used forms of alternative medicines and it has a large worldwide market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The exact size is uncertain, but information available on homeopathic sales suggests it forms a large share of the medical market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999, about 1000 UK doctors practiced homeopathy, most being general practitioners who prescribe a limited number of remedies. A further 1500 homeopaths with no medical training are also thought to practice. Over ten thousand German and French doctors use homeopathy.&lt;ref name="Vickers 1115–11182"/&gt; In the United States a National Health Interview Survey estimated 5 million adults and 1 million children used homeopathy in 2011. An analysis of this survey concluded that most cases were self-prescribed for colds and musculoskeletal pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Homeopathy|url=https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy|access-date=2020-09-02|website=NCCIH|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major retailers like [[Walmart]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Walgreens]] sell homeopathic products that are packaged to resemble conventional medicines.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The homeopathic drug market in Germany is worth about 650 million euro with a 2014 survey finding that 60 percent of Germans reported trying homeopathy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A 2009 survey found that only 17 percent of respondents knew how homeopathic medicine was made.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; France spent more than US$408 million on homeopathic products in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the United States the homeopathic market is worth about $3 billion-a-year;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fox|first=Maggie|date=2017|title=Homeopathic products useless and often even harmful, FDA says|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-crack-down-snake-oil-homeopathy-n830756|access-date=2020-09-04|website=NBC News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2.9 billion spent in 2007.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Australia spent US$7.3 million on homeopathic medicines in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for animals is termed "veterinary homeopathy" and dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.&lt;ref name="Saxton2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saxton|first1=J|year=2007|title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy|journal=Homeopathy|volume=96|issue=1|page=3|doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010|pmid=17227741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of homeopathy in the [[organic farming]] industry is heavily promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Doehring|first1=C.|last2=Sundrum|first2=A.|date=2016-12-17|title=Efficacy of homeopathy in livestock according to peer-reviewed publications from 1981 to 2014|journal=The Veterinary Record|volume=179|issue=24|pages=628|doi=10.1136/vr.103779|issn=0042-4900|pmc=5256414|pmid=27956476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that homeopathy's effects in humans are due to the placebo effect and the counseling aspects of the consultation, such treatments are even less effective in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lees|first1=P.|last2=Pelligand|first2=L.|last3=Whiting|first3=M.|last4=Chambers|first4=D.|last5=Toutain|first5=P-L.|last6=Whitehead|first6=M.L.|date=2017-08-19|title=Comparison of veterinary drugs and veterinary homeopathy: part 2|journal=[[The Veterinary Record]]|volume=181|issue=8|pages=198–207|doi=10.1136/vr.104279|issn=0042-4900|pmc=5738588|pmid=28821700|quote=In human medicine, there may be a place for the counselling/psychotherapeutic aspects of homeopathic consults and the placebo effects generated by homeopathic products in patients who believe in such treatments, but in veterinary medicine these factors are unlikely to benefit patients, and the use of homeopathic products in veterinary medicine is contrary to best evidence, irrational, and inconsistent with current scientific and medical knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that giving animals placebos can play active roles in influencing pet owners to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.&lt;ref name="Hektoen" /&gt; This means that animals given homeopathic remedies will continue to suffer, resulting in [[animal welfare]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lees|first1=P.|last2=Pelligand|first2=L.|last3=Whiting|first3=M.|last4=Chambers|first4=D.|last5=Toutain|first5=P-L.|last6=Whitehead|first6=M.
