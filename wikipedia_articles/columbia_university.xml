'''Columbia University''' (also known as '''Columbia''', and officially as '''Columbia University in the City of New York''') is a [[Private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[New York City]]. Established in 1754 as '''King's College''' on the grounds of [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in [[Manhattan]], Columbia is the oldest institution of higher education in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the fifth-oldest institution of [[higher learning]] in the United States. It is one of nine [[colonial colleges]] founded prior to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], seven of which belong to the [[Ivy League]]. Columbia is ranked among the top universities in the world by major education publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities|title=National University Rankings|date=|website=Usnews.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2018.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities|date=|website=Shanghairanking.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings|title=Best Global Universities Rankings|date=October 30, 2018|website=Usnews.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[Ivy League]].

Columbia was established by [[royal charter]] from [[George II of Great Britain]] in reaction to the founding of [[Princeton University|Princeton College]]. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the [[American Revolution]], and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Jay]]. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] and renamed Columbia University.

[[File:Johnson2.JPG|thumb|[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]], the first [[List of presidents of Columbia University|president of Columbia]]]]
Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the [[Province of New York]] began as early as 1704, at which time [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Colonel Lewis Morris]] wrote to the [[United Society Partners in the Gospel|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], the missionary arm of the [[Church of England]], persuading the society that [[New York City]] was an ideal community in which to establish a college.&lt;ref name="McCaughey20032"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCaughey|first=Robert|title=Stand, Columbia : A History of Columbia University in the City of New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13008-0|location=New York, New York|page=1}}&lt;!--|access-date=April 11, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the founding of the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (renamed [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]] that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.&lt;ref name="McCaughey20032" /&gt; In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the [[Church of England]], to direct the funds accrued by the [[state lottery]] towards the foundation of a college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keppel|first=Fredrick Paul|url=https://archive.org/details/columbia01keppgoog|title=Columbia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1914|location=Oxford, England|page=[https://archive.org/details/columbia01keppgoog/page/n49 26]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Matthews 19042"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Brander|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorycolumbi02unkngoog|title=A History of Columbia University: 1754–1904|author2=John Pine|author3=Harry Peck|author4=Munroe Smith|publisher=Macmillan Company|year=1904|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–10}} Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], located on what is now lower [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Butler 19122"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Nicholas Murray|title=An Official Guide to Columbia University|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1912|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the [[State of New York]] and the fifth oldest in the United States.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Columbia2" /&gt;

In 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by [[Myles Cooper]], a graduate of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and an ardent [[Tory]]. In the charged political climate of the [[American Revolution]], his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="Butler 19122" /&gt;{{rp|3}} The [[Irish people|Irish]] anatomist, [[Samuel Clossy]], was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.&lt;ref name="Stookey2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stookey|first1=Byron|date=1964|title=SAMUEL CLOSSY, A.

The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their [[Evacuation Day (New York)|departure]] in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schecter|first=Barnet|url=https://archive.org/details/battlefornewyork00sche|title=The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8027-1374-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCullough|first=David|title=1776|title-link=1776 (book)|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4|author-link=David McCullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists were forced to abandon their King's College in New York, but some led by [[Charles Inglis (bishop)|Bishop Charles Inglis]] fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they founded [[King's-Edgehill School|King's Collegiate School]] and the [[University of King's College]].&lt;ref name="LP2"&gt;{{London Gazette

After the Revolution, the college turned to the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.&lt;ref name="Matthews 19042" /&gt;{{rp|59}} The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed "an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College".&lt;ref name="Matthews 19042" /&gt; The Act created [[Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York|a board of regents]] to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that "the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]",&lt;ref name="Matthews 19042" /&gt; a reference to [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], an alternative name for America. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by [[John Jay]] and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Moore, Nathanal Fischer (1846). ''A Historical Sketch of Columbia''. New York, New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65–70}}

On May 21, 1787, [[William Samuel Johnson]], the son of [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]], was unanimously elected president of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the [[First Continental Congress]] and been chosen as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Groce|first=C. G.|title=William Samuel Johnson: A Maker of the Constitution|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1937|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President [[George Washington]] and Vice President [[John Adams]] attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.&lt;ref name="Matthews 19042" /&gt;{{rp|74}}

In November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|53–60}} The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily [[Gothic Revival]] campus on 49th Street and [[Madison Avenue]], where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|F.A.P.

There was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend.

In the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the [[Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs|School of International and Public Affairs]] was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Columbia University in the City of New York|url=http://www.columbia.edu/newcuhome/content/history.html|access-date=November 24, 2016|website=Columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the [[Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSAS at a Glance – Columbia University – Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|url=http://gsas.columbia.edu/content/gsas-glance|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310122351/http://gsas.columbia.edu/content/gsas-glance|archive-date=March 10, 2014|access-date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the [[Columbia University School of the Arts|School of the Arts]], and the [[Columbia University School of Professional Studies|School of Professional Studies]] were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools.

===Morningside Heights===
[[File:Columbia_College_Walk.jpg|thumb|College Walk]]
The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] on [[Seth Low]]'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning principles by the architects [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six [[City block|city blocks]], or {{convert|32|acres|abbr=on}}, in [[Morningside Heights]], New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Unearthing the Underground|url=http://features.columbiaspectator.com/eye/2016/04/13/unearthing-the-underground/|access-date=2021-05-05|website=Columbia Spectator|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Butler_Library_-_1000px_-_AC.jpg|left|thumb|[[Butler Library]]]]
The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as [[Butler Library]], is the largest single library in the [[Columbia University Library System]], and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as "South Hall" by the university's former president [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] as expansion plans for [[Low Memorial Library]] stalled, the new library was funded by [[Edward Harkness]], benefactor of Yale's [[residential college]] system, and designed by his favorite architect, [[James Gamble Rogers]]. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the [[Ionic order]] above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butler Library: Self-Guided Tour|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, [[Columbia University Library System|Columbia's library system]] includes over 14 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A statue by sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] called ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' is centered on the front steps of [[Low Memorial Library]]. McKim, Mead &amp; White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing [[List of Latin phrases (S)|sapientia and doctrina]]. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a [[royal charter]] institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture|title=Alma Mater (sculpture)|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!20526~!0#focus|access-date=April 14, 2011|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a [[women's college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meredith Foster|date=February 11, 2011|title=The Myth of the College Sweetheart|url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307091227/http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|archive-date=March 7, 2011|access-date=April 14, 2011|work=The Eye|publisher=Columbia Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 19, 1999|title=What Is the Mace?

"The Steps", alternatively known as "Low Steps" or the "Urban Beach", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace.

In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Greenmarket|url=http://www.grownyc.org/columbiagreenmarket|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=GrowNYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University Green Report Card|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/columbia-university|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=The College Sustainability Report Card}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia has been rated "B+" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University Green Report Card|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/columbia-university|access-date=April 18, 2011|publisher=College Sustainability Report Card}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:116th_Street_Columbia_University_Station.JPG|thumb|Access to Columbia is enhanced by the [[116th Street–Columbia University (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|116th Street–Columbia University]] subway station ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh north}}) on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]].]]
According to the [[A. W.

=== Transportation ===
[[Columbia Transportation]] is the bus service of the university, operated by [[Academy Bus Lines]]. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all [[The School at Columbia|TSC]] students can ride the buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Columbia Transportation|url=https://transportation.columbia.edu/|access-date=2021-05-06|website=transportation.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
=== Undergraduate admissions and financial aid ===
[[File:Vanamquad.JPEG|left|thumb|[[John Howard Van Amringe (sculpture)|Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial]]]]
Columbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Columbia acceptance rate drops to record low 3.7 percent after 51 percent spike in applications|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/04/07/columbia-acceptance-rate-drops-to-record-low-37-percent-after-51-percent-spike-in-applications/|access-date=2021-05-15|website=Columbia Daily Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.&lt;ref name="stat2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Aid Statistics|url=http://cc-seas.financialaid.columbia.edu/eligibility/facts|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University Tuition And Costs|url=http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg03_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=399|access-date=November 22, 2016|website=Collegedata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus [[John Kluge]] to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=2007-04-11|title=Columbia to Receive $400 Million for Student Aid|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/nyregion/11columbia.html|access-date=2021-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=March 11, 2008|title=Columbia University to Offer Financial Aid to More Students|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/education/11columbia.html|access-date=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] and the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the [[Common Application]]. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last [[Ivy League]] university to switch to the Common Application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|date=March 23, 2010|title=Columbia, Michigan and Connecticut Among 25 Colleges to Add Common Application|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/common-2/|access-date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars "distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Named Scholars|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/scholars/named|access-date=August 3, 2015|website=Studentaffairs.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the first modern college application". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gross, Jessica|date=November 10, 2013|title=Who Made That College Application?|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/who-made-that-college-application.html|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is "[[Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York|The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York]]". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.&lt;ref name="Columbia.edu2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Trustees|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|access-date=April 17, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lowbanners.jpg|left|thumb|Low Memorial Library]]
The University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve ''ex officio'', and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University Senate|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/|access-date=April 17, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senate.columbia.edu2"&gt;{{cite web|date=2017|title=Election packet|url=http://senate.columbia.edu|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/topbar_pages/elections.html|website=Senate.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Presidents of Columbia University|The president of Columbia University]], who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.&lt;ref name="Columbia.edu2" /&gt; [[Lee C. Bollinger]] became the 19th president of Columbia University on June 1, 2002. As [[president of the University of Michigan]], he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases [[Grutter v Bollinger|Grutter v. Bollinger]] and [[Gratz v Bollinger|Gratz v. Bollinger]], which upheld the use of student diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the President: Lee Bollinger|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/president/docs/bio/index.html|access-date=April 14, 2011|website=Columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Broadcasting====
Columbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate [[campus radio]] broadcasting, [[WKCR-FM]] and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, [[WBAR (Barnard College)|WBAR]]. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2009|title="The Original FM": The Columbia University Radio Club|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|access-date=January 12, 2013|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest [[student television station]] and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTV News|url=http://www.ctvnewsonline.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104113018/http://www.ctvnewsonline.com/|archive-date=November 4, 2006|access-date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTV|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ctv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820181902/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ctv/|archive-date=August 20, 2006|access-date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including talks, #StartupColumbia, a conference and venture competition for $250,000, and Ignite@CU, a weekend for undergrads interested in design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Notable speakers include [[Peter Thiel]], [[Jack Dorsey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Swartz|date=September 17, 2013|title=Square's Jack Dorsey goes recruiting in NYC|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/09/17/jack-dorsey-square-twitter-paypal-intuit/2777621/|access-date=August 3, 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis Ohanian]], [[Drew Houston]], and [[Mark Cuban]].

Columbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against [[Rutgers University]] in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student [[Maxie Long]] set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18–0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1–0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2004|title=Columbia Athletics Highlight|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/athletics/athletics_timeline.html|access-date=April 11, 2011|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA [[Football Championship Subdivision]]. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16–13 victory over arch-rival [[Princeton University]].

In one of the school's longest-lasting traditions, begun in 1975, at midnight before the [[Organic chemistry|Organic Chemistry]] exam—often the first day of final exams—the [[Columbia University Marching Band]] invaded and briefly occupied the main undergraduate reading room in [[Butler Library]] to distract and entertain studying students with some forty-five minutes of raucous jokes and music, beginning and ending with the singing of the school's fight song, "[[Roar, Lion, Roar]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=December 20, 1975|title=Columbia Cram Session Can Be Fun, Too|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/20/archives/columbia-cram-session-can-be-fun-too.html|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the main show before a crowd that routinely began filling the room well before the announced midnight start time, the Band led a procession to several campus locations, including the residential quadrangle of [[Barnard College]] for more music and temporary relief from the stress of last-minute studying.

The Band's official alumni organization, the Columbia University Band Alumni Association, registered protests with the administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orgo Night!|url=http://columbiabandalumni.org/orgo-night/|access-date=April 23, 2018|website=Columbiabandalumni.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ad hoc group of alumni writing under the name "A.

The campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of [[Kent Hall]] and [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]] on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by ''a cappella'' groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Hollander|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|access-date=April 15, 2011|publisher=Columbia University News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], but lapsed before being revived by President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in 1910. A troop of students dressed as [[Continental Army]] soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of [[John Jay Hall]], where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' by [[Clement Clarke Moore]] and ''[[Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus]]'' by [[Francis Pharcellus Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollander|first=Jason|date=December 3, 1999|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|access-date=August 10, 2006|work=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
