'''Rudolph William Louis Giuliani''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|uː|l|i|ˈ|ɑː|n|i}}, {{IPA-it|dʒuˈljaːni|lang}}; born May 28, 1944) is an American politician and currently inactive attorney, who served as the 107th [[Mayor of New York City]] from 1994 to 2001. He served as [[United States Associate Attorney General]] from 1981 to 1983 and [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] from 1983 to 1989.&lt;ref name="Robertiello" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/nomination-rudolph-w-giuliani-be-associate-attorney-general|title=Nomination of Rudolph W.

Giuliani led the [[Mafia Commission Trial|1980s federal prosecution]] of [[Five Families|New York City mafia]] bosses as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;The crime families were the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]], [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]], [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]], [[Colombo crime family|Colombo]], and [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]].

In 2002, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, [[Giuliani Partners]],&lt;ref name="Robertiello" /&gt; and acquired, but later sold, an [[investment banking]] firm, Giuliani Capital Advisors.

Giuliani attended [[Manhattan College]] in [[Riverdale, Bronx]], where he majored in [[political science]] with a minor in philosophy&lt;ref name="Raceforcityhall"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Bearak |first1=Barry |last2=Fisher |first2=Ian |date=October 19, 1997 |title=A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered becoming a priest.&lt;ref name="Raceforcityhall" /&gt;
Giuliani was elected president of his class in his sophomore year, but was not re-elected in his junior year. He joined the Phi Rho Pi college forensic fraternity and honor society. He graduated in 1965. Giuliani decided to forgo the priesthood and instead attended the [[New York University School of Law]] in Manhattan, where he made the ''[[NYU Law Review]]''&lt;ref name="Raceforcityhall" /&gt; and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1968.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/bio.html |title=A Biography of Mayor Rudolph W.

Giuliani started his political life as a Democrat. He volunteered for [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign in 1968. He also worked as a Democratic Party committeeman on Long Island in the mid-1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://p2008.org/chrnprep08/dncgiuliani121306.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725173611/http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2008/chrnprep08/dncgiuliani121306.html|url-status=dead|title=DNC Statement on Giuiliani's Potential Presidential Bid-Nov. 13, 2006|archive-date=July 25, 2008|website=p2008.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nationrudy"&gt;Jack Newfield, [http://www.thenation.com/article/full-rudy-man-mayor-myth/ "The Full Rudy: The Man, the Mayor, the Myth"], ''[[The Nation]]'', May 30, 2002; retrieved June 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and voted for [[George McGovern]] for president in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2007/03/13/swiftboat_rudy/ |title=What an anti-Giuliani ad should say |work=Salon.com |date=March 13, 2007 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal career ==

[[File:Reagan Contact Sheet C20382 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Giuliani greeting President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984]]

Upon graduation from law school, Giuliani [[law clerk|clerked]] for Judge [[Lloyd Francis MacMahon]], United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giuliani, Rudy |year=2002 |title=Leadership |url=https://archive.org/details/leadershipthroug00rudo |url-access=registration |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0-7868-6841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani did not serve in the military during the [[Vietnam War]]. His [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] was deferred while he was enrolled at Manhattan College and NYU Law. Upon graduation from the latter in 1968, he was [[Selective Service System#Classifications|classified]] 1-A (available for military service), but in 1969 he was reclassified 2-A (essential civilian) as Judge MacMahon's law clerk. In 1970, Giuliani was reclassified 1-A but received a high 308 draft lottery number and was not called up for service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0212072giuliani18.html |title=Rudolf W.

In 1975, Giuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent.&lt;ref name="nationrudy" /&gt; This occurred during a period of time in which he was recruited for a position in Washington, D.C. with the [[Ford administration]]: Giuliani served as the [[Associate Deputy Attorney General]] and [[Chief of staff (politics)|chief of staff]] to [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Harold R. Tyler Jr.|Harold "Ace" Tyler]].&lt;ref name="nationrudy" /&gt;

His first high-profile prosecution was of Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bertram L. Podell]] ([[New York's 13th congressional district|NY-13]]), who was convicted of corruption. Podell pleaded guilty to conspiracy and conflict of interest for accepting more than $41,000 in campaign contributions and legal fees from a Florida airline to obtain federal rights for a Bahama route. Podell, who maintained a legal practice while serving in Congress, said the payments were legitimate legal fees. The ''Washington Post'' later reported: "The trial catapulted future New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani to front-page status when, as assistant U.S. attorney, he relentlessly cross-examined an initially calm Rep. Podell. The congressman reportedly grew more flustered and eventually decided to plead guilty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/21/AR2005082101051.html "Convicted Politician Bertram Podell, 79"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. August 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 1981, during the [[Carter administration]], Giuliani practiced law at the [[Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler]] [[law firm]], as chief of staff to his former boss, Ace Tyler. In later years, Tyler became "disillusioned" by what Tyler described as Giuliani's time as US Attorney, criticizing several of his prosecutions as "overkill".&lt;ref name="nationrudy" /&gt;

On December 8, 1980, one month after [[1980 United States presidential election|the election of Ronald Reagan]] brought Republicans back to power in Washington, he switched his party affiliation from Independent to Republican.&lt;ref name="nationrudy" /&gt; Giuliani later said the switches were because he found Democratic policies "naïve", and that "by the time I moved to Washington, the Republicans had come to make more sense to me."&lt;ref name="usa020707" /&gt; Others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the Justice Department.&lt;ref name="nationrudy" /&gt; Giuliani's mother maintained in 1988 that he "only became a Republican after he began to get all these jobs from them. He's definitely not a conservative Republican. He thinks he is, but he isn't. He still feels very sorry for the poor."&lt;ref name="nationrudy" /&gt;

In 1981, Giuliani was named [[United States Associate Attorney General|Associate Attorney General]] in the [[Reagan administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/222761/doing-rudy-justice-theodore-b-olson |title=Doing Rudy Justice |work=National Review |date=November 7, 2007 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third-highest position in the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S. Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the [[Department of Corrections]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], and the [[United States Marshals Service]]. In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government's]] "detention posture" regarding the internment of more than 2,000 [[Haiti]]an [[asylum seeker]]s who had entered the country illegally. The U.S. government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were "economic migrants". In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that "political repression, at least in general, does not exist" under [[President of Haiti]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]'s regime.&lt;ref name="Raceforcityhall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/world/around-the-world-us-official-finds-no-repression-in-haiti.html "Around the World; U.S. Official Finds No Repression in Haiti"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. April 3, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Giuliani was appointed to be [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York]], which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases and because the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York|SDNY]] is considered the highest profile United States Attorney's Office in the country, and as such, is often used by those who have held the position as a springboard for running for public office. It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of [[Wall Street]] figures [[Ivan Boesky]] and [[Michael Milken]]. He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, [[organized crime]], and corruption in government.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the [[perp walk]], parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=900005449600/How-to-Avoid-Letting-a-Perp-Walk-Turn-Into-a-Parade?slreturn=20151019230043 |title=How to Avoid Letting a 'Perp Walk' Turn Into a Parade |first=William |last=Mitchelson Jr. |work=National Law Journal |date=March 21, 2006 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Giuliani "patented the perp walk", the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breaking Down the "Perp Walk" |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/03/22/breaking-down-the-perp-walk |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 22, 2006 |first=Peter |last=Lattman |access-date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani's critics claimed that he arranged for people to be arrested, then dropped charges for lack of evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his arrests of alleged [[White-collar crime|white-collar criminals]] at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened, sparked controversy, and damaged the reputations of the alleged "perps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=No more 'perp walks'|url=http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub123.pdf|magazine=National Law Journal|date=August 5, 2002|access-date=June 1, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614015739/http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub123.pdf|archive-date=June 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of [[Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.]], was guilty of [[insider trading]]; in February 1987, he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company's trading floor, with Wigton in tears.&lt;ref name=wigton /&gt; Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond.&lt;ref name=wigton&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_boyer|title=Mayberry Man|work=The New Yorker|first=Peter J.|last=Boyer|date=August 20, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins-cnr02"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Heidi |last1=Collins |first2=Allan |last2=Chernoff |first3=Crystal McCrary |last3=Anthony |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/23/cnr.02.html |title=Body Found in Military Fatigues in Euphrates River; Helmet Boxing; Early Learning in Iraq |publisher=CNN |date=May 23, 2007 |department=Transcripts |access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within three months, charges were dropped against both Wigton and Tabor; Giuliani said, "We're not going to go to trial. We're just the tip of the iceberg," but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until Giuliani's successor was in place.&lt;ref name="Collins-cnr02" /&gt; Giuliani's high-profile raid of the Princeton/Newport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Nocera |first=Joseph |author-link=Joe Nocera |date=August 6, 1995 |title=Junk Bondage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/books/junk-bondage.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mafia Commission trial ===

In the [[Mafia Commission Trial]], which ran from February 25, 1985, through November 19, 1986, Giuliani indicted eleven [[organized crime]] figures, including the heads of New York City's so-called "[[Five Families]]", under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) on charges including [[extortion]], labor racketeering, and [[Contract killing|murder for hire]]. ''Time'' magazine called this "Case of Cases" possibly "the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the [[Chicago Outfit|Chicago Mafia]] was swept away in 1943", and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: "Our approach is to wipe out the five families."&lt;ref name="passionate"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101860210-143096,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204023051/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101860210-143096,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 4, 2007 |title=The Passionate Prosecutor |access-date=November 15, 2006 |last=Stengel |first=Richard |date=June 24, 2001 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[Paul Castellano]] evaded conviction when he and his [[underboss]], [[Thomas Bilotti]], were murdered on the streets of [[Midtown Manhattan]] on December 16, 1985.

According to an FBI memo revealed in 2007, leaders of the Five Families voted in late 1986 on whether to issue a contract for Giuliani's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crime Bosses Considered Hit on Giuliani|url=https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/crime-bosses-considered-hit-on-giuliani/?scp=45&amp;sq=%22carmine%20Persico%22%20commission&amp;st=cse |website=The New York Times The Caucus blog |date=October 5, 2018 |access-date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heads of the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]], [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]], and Genovese families rejected the idea, though Colombo and Gambino leaders, Carmine Persico and [[John Gotti]], encouraged assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/inside-the-american-mob/galleries/mob-murder-faq/at/q-do-mafioso-ever-put-out-contracts-on-law-enforcement-officials-1748568/ |title=Mob Murder FAQ: Do Mafioso ever put out contracts on law enforcement officials? |publisher=National Geographic Society |access-date=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside the Mob Plot to Kill Rudy|url=https://nypost.com/2007/10/25/inside-the-mob-plot-to-kill-rudy/|newspaper=New York Post |access-date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was revealed by a former [[Sicilian Mafia]] member and informant, [[Rosario Naimo]], that [[Salvatore Riina]], a notorious Sicilian Mafia leader, had ordered a murder contract on Giuliani during the mid-1980s.

=== Boesky, Milken trials ===

[[Ivan Boesky]], a Wall Street [[arbitrage]]ur who had amassed a fortune of about $200{{nbs}}million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York to investigate as well. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader [[Michael Milken]]. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a {{frac|3|1|2}}-year prison sentence along with a $100{{nbs}}million fine.&lt;ref name="trumbore"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2000/boesky.html |title=Ivan Boesky |last=Trumbore |first=Brian |publisher=BUYandHOLD |access-date=November 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111092843/http://buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2000/boesky.html |archive-date=November 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud.

== Mayoral campaigns ==

=== 1989 ===

Giuliani first ran for New York City mayor in 1989, when he attempted to unseat three-term incumbent [[Ed Koch]]. He won the September 1989 Republican Party [[primary election]] against business magnate [[Ronald Lauder]], in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was [[Republican In Name Only|not a true Republican]] and after an acrimonious debate between the two men.&lt;ref name="nyt050307"&gt;Katharine Q.

In the general election, Giuliani ran as the [[electoral fusion|fusion]] candidate of both the Republican and the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]] parties. The [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]], which had often co-lined the Republican party candidate, withheld support from Giuliani and ran Lauder instead.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lynn, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/21/nyregion/giuliani-files-2-challenges-to-take-lauder-off-ballot.html?pagewanted=all "Giuliani Files{{nbs}}2 Challenges To Take Lauder off Ballot"], ''The New York Times'', July 21, 1989. Retrieved March 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Party leaders were unhappy with Giuliani on ideological grounds. They cited the Liberal Party's endorsement statement that Giuliani "agreed with the Liberal Party's views on [[affirmative action]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]], [[school prayer]] and tuition [[tax credit]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKinley Jr. |first=James C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/09/nyregion/liberal-party-backs-giuliani.html |title=Liberal Party Backs Giuliani |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 9, 1989 |access-date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During two televised debates, Giuliani framed himself as an agent of change, saying, "I'm the reformer,"&lt;ref name="nyt110589"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/nyregion/in-their-first-debate-dinkins-and-giuliani-go-at-it-gently.html?pagewanted=all "In Their First Debate, Dinkins and Giuliani Go At It, Gently"], ''The New York Times'', November 5, 1989.

He denied other wrongdoing, saying "what we need is a mayor, not a prosecutor," and that Giuliani refused to say "the R-word{{snd}}he doesn't like to admit he's a Republican".&lt;ref name="nyt110589" /&gt; Dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily New York newspapers, while Giuliani won approval from the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackpressusa.com/history/archive_essay.asp?NewsID=1538&amp;Week=45 David Dinkins Elected First Black Mayor of New York] AfroTimes, November 11, 1989 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509173630/http://www.blackpressusa.com/history/archive_essay.asp?NewsID=1538&amp;Week=45 |date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Giuliani lost to Dinkins by a margin of 47,080 votes out of 1,899,845 votes cast, in the closest election in New York City's history. The closeness of the race was particularly noteworthy considering the small percentage of New York City residents who are registered Republicans and resulted in Giuliani being the presumptive nominee for a rematch with Dinkins at the next election.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Giuliani's opponent in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough president [[Ruth Messinger]], who had beaten [[Al Sharpton]] in the September 9, 1997 Democratic primary.&lt;ref name="cnn110497"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/11/04/mayor/ "Giuliani Wins With Ease"], CNN, November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party and not the Conservative Party listing. Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.&lt;ref name="qu102997"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=808 |title=Giuliani Approval, Satisfaction With City Hit New Highs, Quinnipiac College Poll Finds; Mayor's Lead Over Messinger Nears 2–1 |publisher=[[Quinnipiac University]] |date=October 29, 1997 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120184337/https://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=808 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law enforcement ===

The legal underpinning for removing the "squeegee men" from the streets was developed under Giuliani's predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins.&lt;ref name=turnaround /&gt; Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner [[Jack Maple]], also created and instituted [[CompStat]], a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtech.com/magazines/gt/Jack-Maple-Betting-on-Intelligence.html |title=Jack Maple: Betting on Intelligence |publisher=GovTech |access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data.

Some studies conclude that the decline in New York City's crime rate in the 1990s and 2000s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country: what [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist [[Frank Zimring]] calls "the most focused form of policing in history". In his book ''The Great American Crime Decline'', Zimring argues that "up to half of New York's crime drop in the 1990s, and virtually 100 percent of its continuing [[crime decline]] since 2000, has resulted from policing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Heather |last=MacDonald |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_ny_cops.html |title=New York Cops: Still the Finest |magazine=City Journal |date=Summer 2006 |access-date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimring |first=Franklin E. |title=The Great American Crime Decline (Studies in Crime and Public Policy) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=November 3, 2006 |page=272 |isbn=978-0-19-518115-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] about immigration violations, on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of [[deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-12-05-immigrants-nyc_N.htm Officials: Let illegal immigrants report crimes] USA Today, December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During his mayoralty, gay and [[lesbian]] New Yorkers received [[domestic partner]]ship rights. Giuliani induced the city's Democratic-controlled New York City Council, which had avoided the issue for years, to pass legislation providing broad protection for [[same-sex partner]]s. In 1998, he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.isebrand.com/article_Rudy's_gay_friends.htm |title=What will Rudy say to his gay friends? |date=February 26, 2004 |work=Salon |first=Eric |last=Boehlert |author-link=Eric Boehlert |via=isebrand.com |access-date=May 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502061244/http://www.isebrand.com/article_Rudy%27s_gay_friends.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000 U.S. Senate campaign ===

{{Main|2000 United States Senate election in New York}}
[[File:Rudy Giuliani speaking.jpg|thumb|left|Giuliani campaigned for Senate in 2000 before withdrawing after being diagnosed with cancer]]

Due to [[term limits]], Giuliani was ineligible to run in 2001 for a third term as mayor. In November 1998, four-term incumbent Democratic [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat. Due to his high profile and visibility Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party. Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman [[Charles Rangel]] and others to recruit then-[[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]] to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.

An early January 1999 poll showed Giuliani trailing Clinton by ten points.&lt;ref name="nyt013100"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/31/opinion/losing-the-women.html |title=Losing the Women |first=Lee M. |last=Miringoff |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 31, 2000 |access-date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1999, Giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the Senate run. By January 2000, polling for the race dramatically reversed, with Giuliani now pulling nine points ahead of Clinton, in part because his campaign was able to take advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton.&lt;ref name="nyt013100" /&gt; Nevertheless, the Giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses; so closely identified with New York City, he had somewhat limited appeal to normally Republican voters in [[Upstate New York]].&lt;ref name="nyt110699"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/opinion/looking-for-the-senator-from-all-of-new-york.html |title=Looking for the Senator From All of New York |last=Gates |first=George |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 6, 1999 |access-date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Police Department]]'s fatal shooting of [[Patrick Dorismond]] in March 2000 inflamed Giuliani's already strained relations with the city's minority communities,&lt;ref name="gvn-211"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerth |first1=Jeff |author-link=Jeff Gerth |first2=Don |last2=Van Natta Jr. |author2-link=Don Van Natta Jr. |title=Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton |year=2007 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-316-01742-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/herwayhopesambit00gert }}, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue.&lt;ref name="gvn-211" /&gt; By April 2000, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking Giuliani, who said his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/08/nyregion/despite-polls-giuliani-says-that-he-won-t-alter-his-campaign-style.html?pagewanted=all |title=Despite Polls, Giuliani Says That He Won't Alter His Campaign Style |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 8, 2000 |access-date=September 27, 2007|author-link=Adam Nagourney }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was now eight to ten points ahead of Giuliani in the polls.&lt;ref name="gvn-211" /&gt;

Then followed [[2000 United States Senate election in New York#A tumultuous four weeks|four tumultuous weeks]] in which Giuliani learned he had [[prostate cancer]] and needed treatment; his extramarital relationship with [[Judith Nathan]] became public and the subject of a media frenzy; and he announced a separation from his wife [[Donna Hanover]]. After much indecision, on May 19, Giuliani announced his withdrawal from the Senate race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |author-link=Elisabeth Bumiller |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/052000sen-ny-gop.html |title=Giuliani Quits Race for Senate, and G.O.P.

=== September 11 terrorist attacks ===

==== Response ====

Giuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September{{nbs}}11 attacks. He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September{{nbs}}11 and afterwards{{snd}}for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological weapon]]ry into the air was a factor in the attack. In his public statements, Giuliani said:
{{quote|Tomorrow New York is going to be here. And we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before{{nbs}}... I want the people of New York to be an example to the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, that terrorism can't stop us.&lt;ref name="POY2001" /&gt;}}

The 9/11 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term from January{{nbs}}1 to April{{nbs}}1 under the [[New York State Constitution]] (Article{{nbs}}3 Section 25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Content Removed |url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?co=5 |access-date=November 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full four-year term, if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conservative Party and Courts May Hold Key to NYC Mayor's Race – October 1, 2001 |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html |access-date=November 15, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020116071502/http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html |archive-date=January 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end leaders in the [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]] and [[New York Senate|Senate]] indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican convert [[Michael Bloomberg]], took office on January 1, 2002 per normal custom.

Giuliani claimed to have been at the [[Ground Zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]] site "as often, if not more, than most workers{{nbs}}... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I'm one of them." Some 9/11 workers have objected to those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/08/10/2007-08-10_911_workers_outraged_by_new_rudy_claim.html |title=9/11 workers outraged by new Rudy claim |last=Katz |first=Celeste |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=August 10, 2007 |access-date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22227731-663,00.html |title=Giuliani in firing line |last=Quaid |first=Libby |newspaper=Sunday Herald Sun (Australia) |date=August 12, 2007 |access-date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giuliani's 'I'm one of them' remark angers 9-11 workers |first=Dan |last=Sewell |work=[[The Cincinnati Post]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 10, 2007 |page=A1 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CNPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11B01CFAB5D41EF0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420}}&lt;!-- http://news.kypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070810/NEWS01/708100372/1014/NEWS02 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks, Giuliani logged 29 hours at the site over three months beginning September 17. This contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/us/politics/17giuliani.html |last=Buettner |first=Russ |title=For Giuliani, Ground Zero as Linchpin and Thorn |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 17, 2007 |access-date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rudy Giuliani at a NYFPC briefing.jpg|thumb|right|Giuliani at a NYFPC briefing after 9/11]]

When Saudi Prince [[Alwaleed bin Talal]] suggested the attacks were an indication that the United States "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cause," Giuliani asserted, "There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it{{nbs}}... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem." Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10{{nbs}}million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/ |title=Giuliani rejects $10 million from Saudi prince |publisher=CNN |date=October 12, 2001 |access-date=October 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209092439/https://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/ |archive-date=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emergency command center location and communications problems ====

{{Main|Communication during the September 11 attacks#Radio communications}}

Giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the [[NYC Emergency Management|Office of Emergency Management]] headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the [[7&amp;nbsp;World Trade Center]] building. Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous [[World Trade Center bombing|terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center: Profile |url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=world_trade_center |access-date=June 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031021/https://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=world_trade_center |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VV20070808" /&gt;&lt;ref name="village voice 2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Grand Illusion: The untold story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0635%2Cbarrett%2C74322%2C6.html |first1=Wayne |last1=Barentt |author-link1=Wayne Barrett |first2=Dan |last2=Collins |author-link2=Dan Collins (journalist) |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=September 2006 |access-date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Open and Shut |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0549,murphy,70685,6.html |access-date=June 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611004630/https://www.villagevoice.com/news/0549%2Cmurphy%2C70685%2C6.html |archive-date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7{{nbs}}World Trade to power the command center. In May 1997, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on [[Jerome M. Hauer]], who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City's first Director of Emergency Management. Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and ''[[New York Magazine]]'' with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in [[Brooklyn]] but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and claimed that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location. Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter. The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,271917,00.html |title=Transcript: Rudy Giuliani on Fox News Sunday |date=May 14, 2007 |access-date=September 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010042606/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C271917%2C00.html |archive-date=October 10, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;audio and video from interview available on Robert Greenwald's "The REAL Rudy: Command Center"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Onetime Giuliani Insider Is Now a Critic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/us/politics/22giuliani.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |first=Russ |last=Buettner |date=May 22, 2007 |access-date=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Angry Giuliani Aide Lashes Back |url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/angry-giuliani-aide-lashes-back |work=The New York Times |date=May 15, 2007 |access-date=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Wayne |last1=Barrett |first2=Dan |last2=Collins |title=The Real Rudy: From the September print issue: The image of Rudy Giuliani as the hero of September 11 has never been seriously challenged.

In January 2008, an eight-page memo was revealed which detailed the New York City Police Department's opposition in 1998 to location of the city's emergency command center at the Trade Center site. The Giuliani administration overrode these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/us/politics/26emergency.html |title=Memo Details Objections to Command Center Site |last=Rashbaum |first=William K. |date=January 26, 2008 |at=Politics (sec.) |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks. The Commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings.

After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image became that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis. Historian Vincent J. Cannato concluded in September 2006:
{{quote|With time, Giuliani's legacy will be based on more than just 9/11. He left a city immeasurably better off{{snd}}safer, more prosperous, more confident{{snd}}than the one he had inherited eight years earlier, even with the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center at its heart. Debates about his accomplishments will continue, but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101160.html |title=Crisis Management |first=Vincent J. |last=Cannato |date=September 3, 2006 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Aftermath ====

[[File:Rudy Giuliani New York After 9-11.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Von Essen]] and Giuliani at the New York Foreign Press Center Briefing on "New York City After September 11, 2001"]]

For his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary [[knighthood]] ([[Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on February 13, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/02/13/knighthoods/ |title=Giuliani joins a distinguished club |publisher=CNN |author=Reynolds, Dylan |date=February 13, 2002 |access-date=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani initially downplayed the [[health effects arising from the September&amp;nbsp;11 attacks]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and lower Manhattan areas in the vicinity of the [[World Trade Center site]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Ben Smith, "Rudy's Black Cloud", ''New York Daily News'', September 18, 2006, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He moved quickly to reopen [[Wall Street]], and it was reopened on September 17. In the first month after the attacks, he said "The air quality is safe and acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Anita Gates, "Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles", ''The New York Times'', September 11, 2006, reporting on the documentary, "Dust to Dust: The Health Effects of 9/11"&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani took control away from agencies such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], leaving the "largely unknown" city Department of Design and Construction in charge of recovery and cleanup. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of [[respirators]]. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony DePalma, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 14, 2007 or&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/opinion/22tue1.html Macho Mistakes at Ground Zero], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, [[Christie Todd Whitman]], former Republican Governor of [[New Jersey]] and director of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), reportedly said the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but she had been blocked by Giuliani. She said she believed the subsequent [[lung disease]] and deaths suffered by WTC responders were a result of these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/06/23/2007-06-23_christie_blasts_rudy_on_wtc_air-1.html |title=Christie blasts Rudy on WTC air |newspaper=New York Daily News |access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, former deputy mayor [[Joe Lhota]], then with the Giuliani campaign, replied, "All workers at Ground Zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murray |first=Mark |title=Pushing Back Against Whitman |date=June 25, 2007 |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/06/25/234621.aspx |access-date=July 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110133845/https://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/06/25/234621.aspx |archive-date=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani asked the city's Congressional delegation to limit the city's [[Legal liability|liability]] for Ground Zero illnesses to a total of $350{{nbs}}million. Two years after Giuliani finished his term, FEMA appropriated $1{{nbs}}billion to a special insurance fund, called the [[World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company]], to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html?pagewanted=all "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]] issued a letter asserting that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: "Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no [[closure (psychology)|closure]] for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]]," it said, adding: "Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/09/giuliani.firefighters.ap/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404003924/http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/09/giuliani.firefighters.ap/index.html|url-status=dead|title=Giuliani &amp; New York firefighters|archive-date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08,0,2321840,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title=Giuliani foes see another side to his 9/11 activities |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621112054/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08%2C0%2C2321840%2Cprint.story?coll=la-home-headlines |archive-date=June 21, 2007 |first=Peter |last=Wallsten |access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Before 2008 election ====
[[File:Giuliani Bush.jpg|thumb|right|Giuliani and President [[George W. Bush]] in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on August 26, 2004]]

Since leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels. When [[George Pataki]] became Governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both Mayor and Governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since [[John Lindsay]] and [[Nelson Rockefeller]]. Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.b270a4a1d51bb3017bce0ed101c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=nyc_blue_room&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2003a/pr032-03.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |title=Mayor Michael R.

Bush]] for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,
{{quote|Without really thinking, based on just emotion, spontaneous, I grabbed the arm of then-Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and I said to him, 'Bernie, thank God George Bush is our president.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/30/giuliani.transcript/ |title=Giuliani: 'Thank God that George Bush is our president' |publisher=CNN |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, in June 2006, Giuliani started a website called Solutions America to help elect Republican candidates across the nation.

After campaigning on Bush's behalf in the [[2004 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election of 2004]], he was reportedly the top choice for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] after [[Tom Ridge]]'s resignation. When suggestions were made that Giuliani's confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals, he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former New York Police Commissioner [[Bernard Kerik]]. After the formal announcement of Kerik's nomination, information about Kerik's past{{snd}}most notably, that he had ties to organized crime, had failed to properly report gifts he had received, had been sued for [[sexual harassment]] and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servant{{snd}}became known, and Kerik withdrew his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bernstein |first1=Nina |last2=Stein |first2=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/16/national/16nanny.html?_r=0 |title=Mystery Woman in Kerik Case: Nanny |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2004 |access-date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2006, Congress formed the [[Iraq Study Group]] (ISG). This [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] ten-person panel, of which Giuliani was one of the members, was charged with assessing the [[Iraq War]] and making recommendations. They would eventually unanimously conclude that contrary to [[Presidency of George W.

Giuliani spoke in support of the removal of the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]]. The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012.

In November 2006, Giuliani announced the formation of an [[exploratory committee]] toward a run for [[2008 United States presidential election|the presidency in 2008]]. In February 2007, he filed a "statement of candidacy" and confirmed on the television program ''[[Larry King Live]]'' that he was indeed running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/02/14/giuliani.lkl/index.html |title=Giuliani 'not confident' war will turn around |publisher=CNN |access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rudy Giuliani SDSU.jpg|right|thumb|Giuliani at a rally at [[San Diego State University]] in August 2007 when polls showed him as the front-runner for the Republican party's nomination]]

Early polls showed Giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition ever recorded along with high levels of support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007, he was the leader in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Republican Party 2008 presidential candidates|most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans]]. Senator [[John McCain]], who ranked a close second behind the New York Mayor, had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared Republican candidates, with only former Senator [[Fred Thompson]] and former Governor [[Mitt Romney]] showing greater support in some [[Opinion polling for the Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|per-state Republican polls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pollingreport.com/wh08rep.htm |title=WH2008: Republicans |publisher=Polling Report |access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from [[Evangelicalism|evangelist]], [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] founder, and past presidential candidate [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Steinhauser |title=Giuliani, McCain pick up key Christian conservative backing |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/07/conservatives.endorsements/index.html#cnnSTCText |publisher=CNN |date=November 7, 2007 |access-date=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that [[Christian evangelism|evangelicals]] and other [[social conservative]]s could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.&lt;ref name="msnbc110707"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21669328 |title=Pat Robertson endorses Giuliani |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=November 7, 2007 |access-date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Giuliani, while campaigning for Trump, claimed that in the "eight years before Obama" became president, "we didn't have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States". It was noted that 9/11 happened during George W. Bush's first term. [[Politifact]] brought up four more counter-examples (the [[2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting]], the 2002 [[D.C. sniper attacks]], the [[2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting]] and the [[2006 UNC SUV attack]]) to Giuliani's claim.

Giuliani was believed to be a likely pick for Secretary of State in the [[Trump administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-rudy-giuliani.html|title=Rudolph Giuliani's Business Ties Viewed as Red Flag for Secretary of State Job|first1=Mark|last1=Landler|first2=Eric|last2=Lipton|first3=Jo|last3=Becker|date=November 15, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 9, 2016, Trump announced that Giuliani had removed his name from consideration for any Cabinet post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/09/politics/rudy-giuliani-removes-himself-from-consideration-for-trump-cabinet-post/ |title=Trump: No Cabinet post for Rudy Giuliani |newspaper=CNN |date=December 9, 2016 |first1=Tal |last1=Kopan |first2=Daniella |last2=Diaz |access-date=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Advisor to the president =====

On January 12, 2017, the [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser.&lt;ref name=csadviser&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/12/trump-names-rudy-giuliani-as-cybersecurity-adviser/|title=Trump names Rudy Giuliani as cybersecurity adviser|last=Phillip|first=Abby |author-link=Abby Phillip |date=January 12, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post PowerPost blog |access-date=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the [[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency]] (CISA), headed by [[Chris Krebs|Christopher Krebs]] as director and [[Matthew Travis]] as deputy. In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an [[Apple Store]] [[Genius Bar]] when he "was locked out of his [[iPhone]] because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times", belying his putative expertise in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rudy-giuliani-needed-apple-genius-help-unlock-his-iphone-after-n1074241 |title=Rudy Giuliani needed Apple genius help to unlock his iPhone after being named Trump cybersecurity adviser |date=October 31, 2019 |publisher=NBC News |first=Rich |last=Schapiro |access-date=November 18, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Giuliani said he advised [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Trump]] in matters relating to [[Executive Order 13769]], which barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Ben |last=King |title=Judge Jeanine Pirro Rudy Giuliani FULL Interview – 1/28/17 |date=January 28, 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GKL6i38pI |access-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521170603/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GKL6i38pI |archive-date=May 21, 2017 }}&lt;!-- archives do not include video content --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Personal lawyer =====

&lt;!-- [[Doublespeak Award]] links here --&gt;
In mid April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump's legal team, which dealt with the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel investigation]] by [[Robert Mueller]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections]]. Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384028-giuliani-joins-trump-legal-team|title=Giuliani joins Trump legal team|last=Fabian|first=Jordan|date=April 19, 2018|work=The Hill|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May, Giuliani made public that Trump had reimbursed his personal attorney [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]] $130,000 that Cohen had paid to adult-film actress [[Stormy Daniels]] for her agreement not to talk about her alleged affair with Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-trump-stormy-daniels_us_5aea6adee4b00f70f0eefbea|title=Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Lawyer For $130,000 Payment To Stormy Daniels|last=Visser|first=Nick|date=May 2, 2018|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen had earlier insisted he used his own money to pay Daniels, and he implied that he had not been reimbursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/09/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-says-he-paid-stormy-daniels-his-home-equity-line/412335002/|title=Trump lawyer Michael Cohen says he paid Stormy Daniels with his home-equity line|last=Schouten|first=Fredreka|date=March 10, 2018|work=USA Today|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump had previously said he knew nothing about the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/politics/donald-trump-stormy-daniels/index.html|title=Trump says he didn't know about Stormy Daniels payment|last=Liptak|first=Kevin|date=April 6, 2018|work=CNN|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, Giuliani said some of his own statements regarding this matter were "more rumor than anything else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldschlag |first1=William |last2=Janison |first2=Dan |title=Giuliani: I'm still winging it on Trump's Stormy payoff story |url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/trump-giuliani-mueller-daniels-cohen-1.18427393 |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |access-date=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in May 2018, Giuliani, who was asked on whether the promotion of the [[Spygate (conspiracy theory)|Spygate]] conspiracy theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, said the investigators "are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president{{nbs}}... it is for public opinion" on whether to "impeach or not impeach" Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/05/28/rudy-giuliani-spygate-mueller-investigation/|title='It Is for Public Opinion.'

No matter what it is. If President Trump shot [then-FBI director] [[James Comey]], he'd be impeached the next day. Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Date |first1=S.V. |title=Giuliani: Trump Could Have Shot Comey And Still Couldn't Be Indicted For It |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shoot-comey_us_5b145897e4b02143b7cd633e |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=June 4, 2018 |access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not the truth." Giuliani's argument continued: "Truth isn't truth." Giuliani later clarified that he was "referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani defends 'truth isn't truth' remark |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45252493 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=August 20, 2018 |access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally in late July, Giuliani attacked Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as an "incredible liar", two months after calling Cohen an "honest, honorable lawyer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Krawczyk |first1=Kathryn |title=Rudy Giuliani called Michael Cohen an 'honest, honorable lawyer' in May.

It was reported in early September that Giuliani said the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege. Also according to Giuliani, Trump's personal legal team is already preparing a "counter-report" to refute the potential special counsel investigation's report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Toobin |first1=Jeffrey |title=How Rudy Giuliani Turned Into Trump's Clown |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/10/how-rudy-giuliani-turned-into-trumps-clown |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |author-link=Jeffrey Toobin |date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brechbuhl noted the packet came to him from Pompeo, who said it "came over", and Brechbuhl reportedly presumed it was from the White House.

The Justice Department generally avoids taking significant actions relating to political figures that might become public within sixty days of an election.

Regarding "rigged voting machines", Giuliani made several false assertions about [[Dominion Voting Systems]], including that its voting machines used software developed by a competitor, [[Smartmatic]], which he claimed actually owned Dominion, and which he said was founded by the former socialist Venezuelan leader [[Hugo Chávez]].

Though Giuliani himself had voted on October 31 in Manhattan using a [[provisional ballot]] (in which the poll worker doesn't see the voter's name on the rolls, so the voter swears an affidavit oath that they are registered to vote), he repeatedly publicly denounced provisional ballots, arguing that the practice is a source of vote fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Steck|first1=Em|last2=Kaczynski|first2=Andrew|date=January 18, 2021|title=Rudy Giuliani voted with an affidavit ballot, which he bashed in failed effort to overturn election|url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/18/politics/rudy-giuliani-affidavit-ballot-vote-kfile/index.html|access-date=January 20, 2021|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His federal lawsuit against Pennsylvania was dismissed [[Prejudice (legal term)|with prejudice]] on November 21, 2020, with the judge citing "strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations" which were "unsupported by evidence". Giuliani and Jenna Ellis reacted by stating that the ruling "helps" the Trump campaign "get expeditiously to the U.S. Supreme Court". They also pointed out that the judge, [[Matthew W.

[[Tommy Tuberville]], a Trump ally, around 7:00{{nbs}}p.m. on January 6, after the Capitol storming, to ask him to "try to just slow it down" by objecting to multiple states and "raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrow{{snd}}ideally until the end of tomorrow".&amp;nbsp;However, Giuliani mistakenly left the message on the voicemail of another senator, who leaked the recording to ''[[The Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hayes|first=Steve|title=Giuliani to Senator: 'Try to Just Slow it Down'|url=https://thedispatch.com/p/giuliani-to-senator-try-to-just-slow|access-date=2021-01-12|website=thedispatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Perlstein]], a noted historian of the American conservative political movement, termed Giuliani's attempts to slow certification in the wake of the riot as treasonous. "Sedition. Open and shut. He talked about the time that was being opened up. He was welcoming, and using, the violence. This needs to be investigated," Perlstein tweeted on January 11, 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|last=Perlstein|first=Rick|date=January 11, 2021|title=Sedition.

Giuliani faced criticism for his appearance at the rally and the Capitol riot that followed it. Former Congressman and [[Morning Joe|MSNBC host]] [[Joe Scarborough]] called for the arrest of Giuliani, President Trump, and [[Donald Trump Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gstalter |first1=Morgan |title=Scarborough calls for arrest of Trump, Giuliani and Trump Jr. for insurrection against US |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/533072-scarborough-calls-for-arrest-of-trump-giuliani-and-trump-jr-for-insurrection |access-date=January 7, 2021 |work=The Hill |date=January 7, 2021 |language=en |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108020745/https://thehill.com/homenews/media/533072-scarborough-calls-for-arrest-of-trump-giuliani-and-trump-jr-for-insurrection |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manhattan College president Brennan O'Donnell stated in a January{{nbs}}7 open letter to the college community, "one of the loudest voices fueling the anger, hatred, and violence that spilled out yesterday is a graduate of our College, Rudolph Giuliani.

On June 24, 2021, [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|a New York appellate court]] suspended Giuliani's law license. The panel of five justices found that there was "uncontroverted" evidence that Giuliani made "demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public" and that "These false statements were made to improperly bolster (Giuliani's) narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client."&lt;ref name=ReutersSuspended/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatterofGiuliani&gt;{{cite web |title=Matter of Giuliani, 2021 NY Slip Op 04086 (1st Dep't June 24, 2021) |url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2021/2021_04086.htm |website=New York Official Reports |publisher=New York State Law Reporting Bureau |access-date=June 24, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HongSuspends&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hong|first=Nicole|last2=Protess|first2=Ben|date=2021-06-24|title=New York Suspends Giuliani's Law License|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/nyregion/giuliani-law-license-suspended-trump.html|access-date=2021-06-24|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court concluded that Giuliani's conduct "immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law".&lt;ref name=ReutersSuspended/&gt;&lt;ref name=MatterofGiuliani/&gt;&lt;ref name=HongSuspends/&gt; His license was also suspended in Washington D.C. on July 7, 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/politics/rudy-giuliani-suspended-law-washington/index.html |title=Rudy Giuliani suspended from practicing law in Washington, DC |publisher=CNN |author=Katelyn Polantz |date=July 7, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Giuliani Partners ===

=== Bracewell &amp; Giuliani ===

{{Main|Bracewell LLP}}

In 2005, Giuliani joined the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Patterson LLP (renamed Bracewell &amp; Giuliani LLP) as a name partner and basis for the expanding firm's new New York office.&lt;ref name="nyt033005"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/nyregion/30rudy.html |title=Giuliani to Be Partner in Texas Law Firm |author=Healy, Patrick D. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he joined the Texas-based firm he brought Marc Mukasey, the son of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Michael Mukasey]], into the firm.

Despite a busy schedule, Giuliani was highly active in the day-to-day business of the law firm, which was a high-profile supplier of legal and lobbying services to the oil, gas, and energy industries. Its aggressive defense of pollution-causing coal-fired power plants threatened to cause political risk for Giuliani, but association with the firm helped Giuliani achieve fund-raising success in Texas.&lt;ref name="nyt500207"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/us/politics/02giuliani.html |title=Giuliani's Tie to Texas Law Firm May Pose Risk |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Buettner, Russ |date=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Giuliani acted as the lead counsel and lead spokesmen for Bracewell &amp; Giuliani client [[Purdue Pharma]], the makers of [[OxyContin]], during their negotiations with federal prosecutors over charges that the pharmaceutical company misled the public about OxyContin's addictive properties. The agreement reached resulted in Purdue Pharma and some of its executives paying $634.5{{nbs}}million in fines.&lt;ref name="nyt061907"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/19drug.html |title=Big Part of OxyContin Profit Was Consumed by Penalties |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 19, 2007 |author=Meier, Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bracewell &amp; Giuliani represented corporate clients before many U.S. government departments and agencies.

=== Lobbying in Romania ===
In August 2018, Giuliani was retained by [[Freeh Group International Solutions]], a global consulting firm run by former FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], which paid him a fee to lobby Romanian president [[Klaus Iohannis]] to change Romania's anti-corruption policy and reduce the role of the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]].
