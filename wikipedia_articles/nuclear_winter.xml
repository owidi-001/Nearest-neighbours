==General==
"Nuclear winter," or as it was initially termed, "nuclear twilight," began to be considered as a scientific concept in the 1980s, after it became clear that an earlier hypothesis, that [[Nuclear winter#Early work|fireball generated NOx]] emissions would devastate the [[ozone layer]], was losing credibility. It was within this context that the climatic effects of soot from fires became the new focus of the climatic effects of nuclear war.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Winter Documentary 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/88Hampson.html|title=WJohn Hampson's warnings of disaster|website=www.bmartin.cc|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130145905/http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/88Hampson.html|archive-date=2014-11-30|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these model scenarios, various soot clouds containing uncertain quantities of soot were assumed to form over cities, [[Kuwait oil fires|oil refineries]], and more rural [[missile silo]]s. Once the quantity of soot is decided upon by the researchers, the climate effects of these soot clouds are then modeled.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org"&gt;{{cite document|title=An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear conflict /|publisher=Hanscom AFB, MA |hdl = 2027/uc1.31822020694212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "nuclear winter" was a [[neologism]] coined in 1983 by [[Richard P. Turco]] in reference to a one-dimensional computer model created to examine the "nuclear twilight" idea. This model projected that massive quantities of soot and [[smoke]] would remain aloft in the air for on the order of years, causing a severe planet-wide drop in temperature. Turco would later distance himself from these extreme conclusions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite Q|Q63169455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of the predictions on the effects of the 1991 [[Kuwait oil fires]] that were made by the primary team of climatologists that advocate the hypothesis, over a decade passed without any new published papers on the topic. More recently, the same team of prominent modellers from the 1980s have begun again to publish the outputs of computer models. These newer models produce the same general findings as their old ones, namely that the ignition of 100 firestorms, each comparable in intensity to that observed in [[Hiroshima]] in 1945, could produce a "small" nuclear winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5194/acp-7-2003-2007 |author=Robock, Alan |author2=Luke Oman |author3=Georgiy L.

The severity of this cooling in [[Alan Robock|Alan Robock's]] model suggests that the cumulative products of 100 of these firestorms could cool the [[global climate]] by approximately 1&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8&amp;nbsp;°F), largely eliminating the magnitude of [[anthropogenic global warming]] for the next roughly two or three years. Robock has not modeled this, but has speculated that it would have [[Primary production|global agricultural losses]] as a consequence.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/110223-nuclear-war-winter-global-warming-environment-science-climate-change/ |title=Small Nuclear War Could Reverse Global Warming for Years |access-date=2014-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916215816/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/110223-nuclear-war-winter-global-warming-environment-science-climate-change/ |archive-date=2014-09-16 |url-status=live |date=2011-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As nuclear devices need not be detonated to ignite a firestorm, the term "nuclear winter" is something of a misnomer.&lt;ref name="A Nuclear Winter's Tale page 242-244"&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11897 ''A Nuclear Winter's Tale: Science and Politics in the 1980s'', Lawrence Badash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114008/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11897 |date=2012-04-06 }}, pp. 242–44&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of papers published on the subject state that without qualitative justification, nuclear explosions are the cause of the modeled firestorm effects. The only phenomenon that is modeled by computer in the nuclear winter papers is the [[climate forcing]] agent of firestorm-soot, a product which can be ignited and formed by a myriad of means.&lt;ref name="A Nuclear Winter's Tale page 242-244"/&gt; Although rarely discussed, the proponents of the hypothesis state that the same "nuclear winter" effect would occur if 100 conventional firestorms were ignited.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005320/http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} p. 1998. "...fires occurred within a few months of each other in 1945, the Hamburg mass fire occurred in 1943. These five fires potentially placed 5% as much smoke into the stratosphere as our hypothetical nuclear fires. The optical depth resulting from placing 5 Tg of soot into the global stratosphere is about 0.07, which would be easily observable even with techniques available in WWII."&lt;/ref&gt;

A much larger number of firestorms, in the thousands,{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} was the initial assumption of the computer modelers who coined the term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value [[air burst|airbursting]] [[nuclear weapon]] use during an American-Soviet [[total war]]. This larger number of firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled,&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt; are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions as a result of the smoke inputted into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (36&amp;nbsp;°F) in core agricultural regions of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35&amp;nbsp;°C (63&amp;nbsp;°F) in Russia.&lt;ref name="Robock"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robock |first1=A. |last2=Oman |first2=L. |last3=Stenchikov |first3=G.

On the fundamental level, since the advent of photographic evidence of tall clouds were captured,&lt;ref&gt;London 1906, San Francisco Fire and others&lt;/ref&gt; it was known that firestorms could inject soot smoke/[[aerosol]]s into the stratosphere, but the longevity of this slew of aerosols was a major unknown. Independent of the team that continue to publish theoretical models on nuclear winter, in 2006, [[Mike Fromm]] of the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], experimentally found that each natural occurrence of a massive wildfire firestorm, much larger than that observed at Hiroshima, can produce minor "nuclear winter" effects, with short-lived, approximately one month of a nearly immeasurable drop in surface temperatures, confined to the [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]] that they burned in.&lt;ref name="Fire-Breathing Storm Systems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/pyrocb.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824082109/http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/pyrocb.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 August 2014|date=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fromm | first1 = M. | last2 = Tupper | first2 = A. | last3 = Rosenfeld | first3 = D. | last4 = Servranckx | first4 = R. | last5 = McRae | first5 = R. | title = Violent pyro-convective storm devastates Australia's capital and pollutes the stratosphere | doi = 10.1029/2005GL025161 | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = L05815 | year = 2006 |bibcode = 2006GeoRL..33.5815F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/PyroClouds/|title=Russian Firestorm: Finding a Fire Cloud from Space|date=31 August 2010|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|access-date=12 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212163237/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/PyroClouds/|archive-date=12 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is somewhat analogous to the frequent [[Volcanic explosivity index#Classification|volcanic eruptions that inject sulfates into the stratosphere]] and thereby produce minor, even negligible, [[volcanic winter]] effects.

At {{convert|10|-|15|km|mi|abbr=off|0}} above the Earth's surface, the absorption of sunlight could further heat the soot in the smoke, lifting some or all of it into the [[stratosphere]], where the smoke could persist for years if there is no rain to wash it out. This aerosol of particles could heat the stratosphere and prevent a portion of the sun's light from reaching the surface, causing surface temperatures to drop drastically. In this scenario it is predicted{{By whom|date=July 2017}} that surface air temperatures would be the same as, or colder than, a given region's winter for months to years on end.

The modeled stable [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]] of hot soot between the troposphere and high stratosphere that produces the anti-greenhouse effect was dubbed the "Smokeosphere" by [[Stephen Schneider]] et al. in their 1988 paper.&lt;ref&gt;"A Nuclear Winter's Tale By Lawrence Badas" p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hq7_TAFD4osC&amp;q=nuclear+winter| title=Human Impacts on Weather and Climate|first1=William R.| last1=Cotton| first2=Roger A.

Although it is common in the climate models to consider city firestorms, these need not be ignited by nuclear devices;&lt;ref name="A Nuclear Winter's Tale page 242-244"/&gt; more conventional ignition sources can instead be the spark of the firestorms. Prior to the previously mentioned solar heating effect, the soot's injection height is controlled by the [[power (physics)|rate of energy release]] from the firestorm's fuel, not the size of an initial nuclear explosion.&lt;ref name="climate.envsci.rutgers.edu" /&gt; For example, the [[mushroom cloud]] from the [[Little Boy|bomb dropped on Hiroshima]] reached a height of six kilometers (middle troposphere) within a few minutes and then dissipated due to winds, while the individual fires within the city took almost three hours to form into a firestorm and produce a [[pyrocumulus]] cloud, a cloud that is assumed to have reached upper tropospheric heights, as over its multiple hours of burning, the firestorm released an estimated 1000 times the energy of the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism] {{Webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005320/http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} p. 1994.

=== Aerosol removal timescale ===
[[File:SmokeCeilingInLochcarron.jpg|thumb|Smoke rising in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scotland]], is stopped by an overlying natural low-level inversion layer of warmer air (2006).]]
The exact timescale for how long this smoke remains, and thus how severely this smoke affects the climate once it reaches the stratosphere, is dependent on both chemical and physical removal processes.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt;

The most important physical removal mechanism is "[[rainout]]", both during the "fire-driven [[convection|convective]] column" phase, which produces "[[firestorm|black rain]]" near the fire site, and rainout after the [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|convective plume]]'s dispersal, where the smoke is no longer concentrated and thus "wet removal" is believed to be very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism.

At one time it was thought that carbonaceous aerosol might be consumed by reactions with ozone (Stephens et al., 1989) and other oxidants, reducing the lifetime of soot at stratospheric altitudes. However recent data shows that the reaction probability for such loss of soot is about 10^-11 so it is not an important process on times scales of several years (Kamm et al., 2004). A full simulation of stratospheric chemistry, along with additional laboratory studies, would be needed to evaluate the importance of these processes. Rate constants for a number of potentially important reactions are lacking.&lt;/ref&gt; and which also occur at greater concentrations when air is heated to high temperatures.

=== Soot properties ===
{{see also|Tihomir Novakov|Aethalometer}}
Sooty aerosols can have a wide range of properties, as well as complex shapes, making it difficult to determine their evolving atmospheric [[Optical depth#Atmospheric sciences|optical depth]] value. The conditions present during the creation of the soot are believed to be considerably important as to their final properties, with soot generated on the more efficient spectrum of [[stoichiometry|burning efficiency]] considered almost "elemental [[carbon black]]," while on the more inefficient end of the burning spectrum, greater quantities of [[Pyrolysis|partially burnt]]/oxidized fuel are present. These partially burnt "organics" as they are known, often form tar balls and [[brown carbon]] during common lower-intensity wildfires, and can also coat the purer black carbon particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2013/august/new-insights-wildfire-smoke-could-improve-climate-change-models.html|title=New Insights on Wildfire Smoke Could Improve Climate Change Models|access-date=2014-11-03| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104015918/http://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2013/august/new-insights-wildfire-smoke-could-improve-climate-change-models.html|archive-date=2014-11-04|url-status=live|date=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/440827/news/lanl-study-wildfire-smokes-effect-on-climate-underestimated.html|title=LANL study: Wildfire smoke's effect on climate underestimated|first=Olivier|last=Uyttebrouck|website=www.abqjournal.com|access-date=2014-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627114118/http://www.abqjournal.com/440827/news/lanl-study-wildfire-smokes-effect-on-climate-underestimated.html|archive-date=2015-06-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildfiretoday.com/2013/07/17/research-wildland-fire-smoke-contributes-to-climate-change-more-than-previously-thought/|title=Research: wildland fire smoke, including tar balls, contribute to climate change more than previously thought - Wildfire Today|date=17 July 2013|access-date=3 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724224709/http://wildfiretoday.com/2013/07/17/research-wildland-fire-smoke-contributes-to-climate-change-more-than-previously-thought/|archive-date=24 July 2014|url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the soot of greatest importance is that which is injected to the highest altitudes by the pyroconvection of the firestorm – a fire being fed with storm-force winds of air – it is estimated that the majority of the soot under these conditions is the more oxidized black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism.

=== Climatic effects ===
A study presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in December 2006 found that even a small-scale, regional nuclear war could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the [[subtropics]] would each use 50 [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kilotons each) on major population centers, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and, according to the research, could be "catastrophic".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061211090729.htm Regional Nuclear War Could Devastate Global Climate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516230926/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061211090729.htm |date=2018-05-16 }}, Science Daily, December 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Ozone depletion ===
Nuclear detonations produce large amounts of [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]] by breaking down the air around them. These are then lifted upwards by thermal convection. As they reach the stratosphere, these nitrogen oxides are capable of catalytically breaking down the [[ozone]] present in this part of the atmosphere. [[Ozone depletion]] would allow a much greater intensity of harmful [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the sun to reach the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kao |first1=Chih-Yue Jim |last2=Glatzmaier |first2=Gary A. |last3=Malone |first3=Robert C. |last4=Turco |first4=Richard P. |title=Global three-dimensional simulations of ozone depletion under postwar conditions |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=1990 |volume=95 |issue=D13 |pages=22495 |doi=10.1029/JD095iD13p22495|bibcode=1990JGR....9522495K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2008 study by Michael J. Mills et al., published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], found that a nuclear weapons exchange between Pakistan and India using their current arsenals could create a near-global [[ozone hole]], triggering human health problems and causing environmental damage for at least a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Q|Q24657259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer-modeled study looked at a nuclear war between the two countries involving 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear devices on each side, producing massive urban fires and lofting as much as five million metric tons of soot about {{convert|50|mi|km}} into the [[stratosphere]]. The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases, increasing the break down of the stratospheric [[ozone layer]] protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, with up to 70% ozone loss at northern high latitudes.

Another more sequential hypothetical scenario, following the settling out of most of the aerosols in 1–3 years, the cooling effect would be overcome by a heating effect from [[greenhouse warming]], which would raise surface temperatures rapidly by many degrees, enough to cause the death of much if not most of the life that had survived the cooling, much of which is more vulnerable to higher-than-normal temperatures than to lower-than-normal temperatures.  The nuclear detonations would release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases from burning, followed by more released from the decay of dead organic matter. The detonations would also insert [[nitrogen oxide]]s into the stratosphere that would then deplete the [[ozone layer]] around the Earth.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"/&gt; This layer screens out [[Deep ultraviolet|UV-C]] radiation from the [[Sun]], which causes genetic damage to life forms on the surface. As the temperature rises, the amount of water in the [[atmosphere]] would increase, causing further greenhouse warming of the surface, and if it rose enough, it could cause the sublimation of [[methane clathrate]] deposits on the sea floor, releasing huge amounts of [[methane]], a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, perhaps enough to trigger [[runaway climate change]].{{CN|date=May 2019}}

Other more straightforward hypothetical versions exist of the hypothesis that nuclear winter might give way to a nuclear summer. The high temperatures of the nuclear fireballs could destroy the ozone gas of the middle stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.wooster.edu/history/jgates/book-ch11.html|title=THE U.S. ARMY AND IRREGULAR WARFARE, CHAPTER ELEVEN THE CONTINUING PROBLEM OF CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION|author=JOHN M.

In 1952, a few weeks prior to the [[Ivy Mike]] (10.4 [[Megatons|megaton]]) bomb test on [[Elugelab]] Island, there were concerns that the aerosols lifted by the explosion might cool the Earth. Major Norair Lulejian, [[USAF]], and astronomer Natarajan Visvanathan studied this possibility, reporting their findings in ''Effects of Superweapons Upon the Climate of the World'', the distribution of which was tightly controlled. This report is described in a 2013 report by the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] as the initial study of the "nuclear winter" concept. It indicated no appreciable chance of explosion-induced climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Q|Q63070323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications for civil defense of numerous surface bursts of high yield [[hydrogen bomb]] explosions on [[Pacific Proving Ground]] islands such as those of Ivy Mike in 1952 and Castle Bravo (15 Mt) in 1954 were described in a 1957 report on ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', edited by [[Samuel Glasstone]].  A section in that book entitled "Nuclear Bombs and the Weather" states: "The dust raised in severe [[volcanic eruptions]], such as that at [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|Krakatoa]] in 1883, is known to cause a noticeable reduction in the sunlight reaching the earth ... The amount of [soil or other surface] debris remaining in the atmosphere after the explosion of even the largest nuclear weapons is probably not more than about one percent or so of that raised by the Krakatoa eruption. Further, solar radiation records reveal that none of the nuclear explosions to date has resulted in any detectable change in the direct sunlight recorded on the ground."&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?seq=9&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=mdp.39015010999814&amp;u=1&amp;num=69 The Effects of Nuclear Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824081908/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?seq=9&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=mdp.39015010999814&amp;u=1&amp;num=69 |date=2014-08-24 }} Samuel Glasstone, Washington DC, Government Printing Office, 1956, pp. 69071.  A similar report had been issued in 1950 under a slightly different title:  {{cite Q|Q63133275}}. This earlier version seems not to have discussed Krakatoa nor other climate change possibilities.&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Weather Bureau]] in 1956 regarded it as conceivable that a large enough nuclear war with megaton-range surface detonations could lift enough soil to cause a new [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/661272 | pmid=21936194 | volume=26 | title=The Politics of Atmospheric Sciences: "Nuclear Winter" and Global Climate Change | journal=Osiris | pages=198–223 | year=2011 | last1 = Dörries | first1 = Matthias| s2cid=23719340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States National Research Council]] (NRC) book ''Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations'' published in 1975, it states that a nuclear war involving 4,000 Mt from ''present arsenals'' would probably deposit much less dust in the stratosphere than the Krakatoa eruption, judging that the effect of dust and oxides of nitrogen would probably be slight climatic cooling which "would probably lie within normal global climatic variability, but the possibility of climatic changes of a more dramatic nature cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref name="Figure 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=effects /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVArAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Long-term%20worldwide%20effects%20of%20multiple%20nuclear%20weapons%20detonations%22&amp;pg=PA25 |title=National Research Council, ''Long-term worldwide effects of multiple nuclear weapons detonations'', Washington DC, National Academy of Sciences, 1975, p.38 |access-date=2016-06-04 |isbn=9780309024181 |year=1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1985 report, ''The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange'', the Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions argues that a "plausible" estimate on the amount of stratospheric dust injected following a surface burst of 1 Mt is 0.3 teragrams, of which 8 percent would be in the [[Micrometre|micrometer]] range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/effectsonatmosph0000nati |title=Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions, ''The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange'', Washington D.C., National Academy Press, 1985, Chapter: 4 Dust pp. 17–25 |access-date=2009-10-11 |doi=10.17226/540 |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-309-03528-6 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential cooling from soil dust was again looked at in 1992, in a US [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS)&lt;ref name="Sciences 1992, pp. 433"&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Policy implications of greenhouse warming: Mitigation, adaptation and the science base.

In 1969, [[Paul Crutzen]] discovered that [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]] (NOx) could be an efficient catalyst for the destruction of the ozone layer/[[stratospheric ozone]]. Following studies on the potential effects of NOx generated by engine heat in stratosphere flying [[Supersonic Transport]] (SST) airplanes in the 1970s, in 1974, John Hampson suggested in the journal ''[[Nature_(journal)|Nature]]'' that due to the creation of atmospheric NOx by [[nuclear fireball]]s, a full-scale nuclear exchange could result in depletion of the ozone shield, possibly subjecting the earth to ultraviolet radiation for a year or more.&lt;ref name=effects&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/effectsonatmosph0000nati |title=Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions, ''The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange'', Washington D.C., National Academy Press, 1985 |access-date=2009-10-11 |doi=10.17226/540 |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-309-03528-6 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hampson J. |title=Photochemical war on the atmosphere |journal=Nature |volume=250 |issue=5463 |pages=189–91 |date=1974 |doi=10.1038/250189a0 |bibcode=1974Natur.250..189H |s2cid=4167666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Hampson's hypothesis "led directly"&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc1" /&gt; to the [[United States National Research Council]] (NRC) reporting on the models of ozone depletion following nuclear war in the book ''Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations''.&lt;ref name=effects /&gt;

In the section of this 1975 NRC book pertaining to the issue of fireball generated NOx and ozone layer loss therefrom, the NRC present model calculations from the early-to-mid 1970s on the effects of a nuclear war with the use of large numbers of multi-megaton yield detonations, which returned conclusions that this could reduce ozone levels by 50 percent or more in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/effectsonatmosph0000nati |title=Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions, ''The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange'', Washington D.C., National Academy Press, 1985, pg 186 |access-date=2009-10-11 |doi=10.17226/540 |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-309-03528-6 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Figure 1" /&gt;

However independent of the computer models presented in the 1975 NRC works, a paper in 1973 in the journal ''[[Nature_(journal)|Nature]]'' depicts the stratospheric ozone levels worldwide overlaid upon the number of nuclear detonations during the era of atmospheric testing. The authors conclude that neither the data nor their models show any correlation between the approximate 500 Mt in historical atmospheric testing and an increase or decrease of ozone concentration.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldsmith | year = 1973 | title = Nitrogen Oxides, Nuclear Weapon Testing, Concorde and Stratospheric Ozone | url = http://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/pubs/79bias/Goldsmith.pdf | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5418 | pages = 545–551 | doi = 10.1038/244545a0 | bibcode = 1973Natur.244..545G | s2cid = 4222122 | access-date = 2016-10-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161208052639/http://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/pubs/79bias/Goldsmith.pdf | archive-date = 2016-12-08 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, a study on the experimental measurements of an earlier atmospheric nuclear test as it affected the ozone layer also found that nuclear detonations are exonerated of depleting ozone, after the at first alarming model calculations of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.D.|last=Christie|date=1976-05-20|title=Atmospheric ozone depletion by nuclear weapons testing|issue=15|volume=81|pages=2583–2594|doi=10.1029/JC081i015p02583|bibcode=1976JGR....81.2583C|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research}} This link is to the abstract; the entire paper is behind a paywall.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 1981 paper found that the models on ozone destruction from one test and the physical measurements taken were in disagreement, as no destruction was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/JC086iC02p01167 | bibcode=1981JGR....86.1167M | volume=86 | issue=C2 | title=Measurements of nitric oxide after a nuclear burst | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | pages=1167 | year=1981 | last1 = McGhan | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 journalist [[Jonathan Schell]] in his popular and influential book ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', introduced the public to the belief that fireball generated NOx would destroy the ozone layer to such an extent that crops would fail from solar UV radiation and then similarly painted the fate of the Earth, as plant and aquatic life going extinct. In the same year, 1982, Australian physicist [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]], who frequently corresponded with John Hampson who had been greatly responsible for much of the examination of NOx generation,&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc1" /&gt; penned a short historical synopsis on the history of interest in the effects of the direct NOx generated by nuclear fireballs, and in doing so, also outlined Hampson's other non-mainstream viewpoints, particularly those relating to greater ozone destruction from upper-atmospheric detonations as a result of any widely used [[anti-ballistic missile]] ([[ABM-1 Galosh]]) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/88Hampson.html |title=John Hampson's warnings of disaster'', 1988 Crutzen of course knew of Hampson's work, and also had received correspondence from Hampson around 1980.

Martin describes views about potential ozone loss and therefore increases in [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] leading to the widespread destruction of crops, as advocated by Jonathan Schell in ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', as highly unlikely.&lt;ref name="Figure 1" /&gt;

More recent accounts on the specific ozone layer destruction potential of NOx species are much less than earlier assumed from simplistic calculations, as "about 1.2 million tons" of natural and [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] generated stratospheric NOx is believed to be formed each year according to Robert P. Parson in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/science-engineering/ozone-depletion-intro/24-Will-commercial-supersonic-aircraft-damage-the-ozone-laye.html|title=24 Will commercial supersonic aircraft damage the ozone layer?|first=Stas Bekman: stas (at)|last=stason.org|website=stason.org|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606051736/http://stason.org/TULARC/science-engineering/ozone-depletion-intro/24-Will-commercial-supersonic-aircraft-damage-the-ozone-laye.html|archive-date=2016-06-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Science fiction ====
The first published suggestion that cooling of the climate could be an effect of a nuclear war, appears to have been originally put forth by [[Poul Anderson]] and F.N. Waldrop in their post-war story "Tomorrow's Children", in the March 1947 issue of the ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine. The story, primarily about a team of scientists hunting down [[mutant (fiction)|mutants]],&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Science Fiction Magazine'', volume 1, By Michael Ashley, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; warns of a "[[Fimbulwinter]]" caused by dust that blocked sunlight after a recent nuclear war and speculated that it may even trigger a new Ice Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/nuclear_winter#sthash.x25SIeys.dpuf|title=Themes: Nuclear Winter : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728074452/http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/nuclear_winter#sthash.x25SIeys.dpuf|archive-date=2018-07-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/Winter.htm#N_2_|title=Wintry Doom|website=www.aip.org|access-date=2014-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929134255/http://www.aip.org/history/climate/Winter.htm#N_2_|archive-date=2014-09-29|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson went on to publish a novel based partly on this story in 1961, titling it ''Twilight World''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Similarly in 1985 it was noted by T. G. Parsons that the story "Torch" by C. Anvil, which also appeared in ''Astounding Science Fiction'' magazine, but in the April 1957 edition, contains the essence of the "Twilight at Noon"/"nuclear winter" hypothesis. In the story, a nuclear warhead ignites an oil field, and the soot produced "screens out part of the sun's radiation", resulting in Arctic temperatures for much of the population of North America and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt;

=== 1980s ===
The 1988 Air Force Geophysics Laboratory publication, ''An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war'' by H. S. Muench, et al., contains a chronology and review of the major reports on the nuclear winter hypothesis from 1983–1986. In general, these reports arrive at similar conclusions as they are based on "the same assumptions, the same basic data", with only minor model-code differences. They skip the modeling steps of assessing the possibility of fire and the initial fire plumes and instead start the modeling process with a "spatially uniform soot cloud" which has found its way into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt;

Although never openly acknowledged by the multi-disciplinary team who authored the most popular 1980s TTAPS model, in 2011 the [[American Institute of Physics]] states that the TTAPS team (named for its participants, who had all previously worked on the phenomenon of dust storms on Mars, or in the area of asteroid [[impact event]]s: [[Richard P. Turco]], [[Owen Toon]], Thomas P. Ackerman, [[James B.

In 1981, William J. Moran began discussions and research in the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] (NRC) on the airborne soil/dust effects of a large exchange of nuclear warheads, having seen a possible parallel in the dust effects of a war with that of the asteroid-created [[K-T boundary]] and its popular analysis a year earlier by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange (1985)
Chapter: Appendix: Evolution of Knowledge About Long-Term Nuclear Effects, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; An NRC study panel on the topic met in December 1981 and April 1982 in preparation for the release of the NRC's ''The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange'', published in 1985.&lt;ref name=effects /&gt;

As part of a study on the creation of [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizing species]] such as NOx and ozone in the troposphere after a nuclear war,&lt;ref name="Nuclear Winter Documentary 1984"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCTKcd2Ko98 On the 8th Day – Nuclear Winter Documentary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614084513/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCTKcd2Ko98 |date=2017-06-14 }} (1984) 21:40&lt;/ref&gt; launched in 1980 by ''[[AMBIO]]'', a journal of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and John Birks began preparing for the 1982 publication of a calculation on the effects of nuclear war on stratospheric ozone, using the latest models of the time. However, they found that in part as a result of the trend towards more numerous but less energetic, sub-megaton range nuclear warheads (made possible by the ceaseless march to increase ICBM warhead [[Circular Error Probable|accuracy]]), the ozone layer danger was "not very significant".&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc1"/&gt;

It was after being confronted with these results that they "chanced" upon the notion, as "an afterthought"&lt;ref name="Nuclear Winter Documentary 1984" /&gt; of nuclear detonations igniting massive fires everywhere and, crucially, the smoke from these conventional fires then going on to absorb sunlight, causing surface temperatures to plummet.&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc1"/&gt; In early-1982, the two circulated a draft paper with the first suggestions of alterations in short-term climate from fires presumed to occur following a nuclear war.&lt;ref name=effects /&gt; Later in the same year, the special issue of ''[[AMBIO|Ambio]]'' devoted to the possible environmental consequences of nuclear war by Crutzen and Birks was titled "Twilight at Noon", and largely anticipated the nuclear winter hypothesis.&lt;ref name="crutzen" /&gt; The paper looked into fires and their climatic effect and discussed particulate matter from large fires, nitrogen oxide, ozone depletion and the effect of nuclear twilight on agriculture. Crutzen and Birks' calculations suggested that smoke particulates injected into the atmosphere by fires in cities, forests and petroleum reserves could prevent up to 99 percent of sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface. This darkness, they said, could exist "for as long as the fires burned", which was assumed to be many weeks, with effects such as: "The normal dynamic and temperature structure of the atmosphere would ... change considerably over a large fraction of the Northern Hemisphere, which will probably lead to important changes in land surface temperatures and wind systems."&lt;ref name=crutzen /&gt; An implication of their work was that a successful nuclear [[decapitation strike]] could have severe climatic consequences for the perpetrator.

The use of these influential Martian dust storm models in nuclear winter research began in 1971,&lt;ref name="Vladimir Gubarev 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vladimir Gubarev |title=Tea Drinking in The Academy.

The orbiting instruments together with the 1971 [[Mars 3]] lander determined that temperatures on the surface of the red planet were considerably colder than temperatures at the top of the dust cloud. Following these observations, Golitsyn received two telegrams from astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], in which Sagan asked Golitsyn to "explore the understanding and assessment of this phenomenon." Golitsyn recounts that it was around this time that he had "proposed a theory{{which|date=December 2016}} to explain how Martian dust may be formed and how it may reach global proportions."&lt;ref name="Vladimir Gubarev 2001"/&gt;

G.S. Golitsyn and A.S. Ginsburg. Tellus (1985), 378, 173–81&lt;/ref&gt; an employee in Golitsyn's institute, developed a model of dust storms to describe the cooling phenomenon on Mars. Golitsyn felt that his model would be applicable to soot after he read a 1982 Swedish magazine dedicated to the effects of a hypothetical nuclear war between the USSR and the US.&lt;ref name="Vladimir Gubarev 2001"/&gt; Golitsyn would use Ginzburg's largely unmodified dust-cloud model with soot assumed as the aerosol in the model instead of soil dust and in an identical fashion to the results returned, when computing dust-cloud cooling in the Martian atmosphere, the cloud high above the planet would be heated while the planet below would cool drastically. Golitsyn presented his intent to publish this Martian-derived Earth-analog model to the [[Andropov]] instigated ''Committee of Soviet Scientists in Defence of Peace Against the Nuclear Threat'' in May 1983, an organization that Golitsyn would later be appointed a position of vice-chairman of. The establishment of this committee was done with the expressed approval of the Soviet leadership with the intent "to expand controlled contacts with Western [[nuclear disarmament|"nuclear freeze" activists]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bostonreview.net/world/vladislav-m-zubok-gorbachevs-nuclear-learning|title=Gorbachev's Nuclear Learning|last=Intern|date=21 July 2014|access-date=21 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818075324/http://bostonreview.net/world/vladislav-m-zubok-gorbachevs-nuclear-learning|archive-date=18 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having gained this committees approval, in September 1983, Golitsyn published the first computer model on the nascent "nuclear winter" effect in the widely read ''[[Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ng.ru/science/2003-10-08/14_winter.html |title=Igor Shumeyko, ''Heavy dust "nuclear winter"'', 2003-10-08 |access-date=2009-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617081632/http://www.ng.ru/science/2003-10-08/14_winter.html |archive-date=2011-06-17 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan had also worked on [[Project A119]] in the 1950s–1960s, in which he attempted to model the movement and longevity of a plume of lunar soil.

After the publication of "Twilight at Noon" in 1982,&lt;ref name=badash/&gt; the TTAPS team have said that they began the process of doing a 1-dimensional computational modeling study of the atmospheric consequences of nuclear war/soot in the stratosphere, though they would not publish a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine until late-December 1983.&lt;ref name="R. P. Turco, O. B. Toon, T. P. Ackerman, J. B. Pollack, and Carl Sagan 1283–92" /&gt; The phrase "nuclear winter" had been coined by Turco just prior to publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=cache:HPi24DhYQb8J:www.answers.com/topic/nuclear-winter+turco+nuclear+winter&amp;hl=en|title=US Military History Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this early paper, TTAPS used assumption-based estimates on the total smoke and dust emissions that would result from a major nuclear exchange, and with that, began analyzing the subsequent effects on the atmospheric [[radiation balance]] and temperature structure as a result of this quantity of assumed smoke. To compute dust and smoke effects, they employed a one-dimensional microphysics/radiative-transfer model of the Earth's lower atmosphere (up to the mesopause), which defined only the vertical characteristics of the global climate perturbation.

Interest in the environmental effects of nuclear war, however, had continued in the Soviet Union after Golitsyn's September paper, with [[Vladimir Alexandrov]] and G. I. Stenchikov also publishing a paper in December 1983 on the climatic consequences, although in contrast to the contemporary TTAPS paper, this paper was based on simulations with a three-dimensional global circulation model.&lt;ref name="Alexandrov, V. V 1983" /&gt; (Two years later Alexandrov disappeared under mysterious circumstances). Richard Turco and Starley L. Thompson were both critical of the Soviet research. Turco called it "primitive" and Thompson said it used obsolete US computer models.&lt;ref name=badash&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8M5vx-Lrk0C&amp;q=weak+and+primitive |title=Laurence Badash, ''A Nuclear Winter's Tale'' |access-date=2016-06-04|isbn=9780262257992 |last1=Badash |first1=Lawrence |date=2009-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they were to rescind these criticisms and instead applauded Alexandrov's pioneering work, saying that the Soviet model shared the weaknesses of all the others.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt;

In 1984, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) commissioned Golitsyn and N. A. Phillips to review the state of the science. They found that studies generally assumed a scenario where half of the world's nuclear weapons would be used, ~5000 Mt, destroying approximately 1,000 cities, and creating large quantities of carbonaceous smoke – 1–{{val|2|e=14|u=g}} being most likely, with a range of 0.2–{{val|6.4|e=14|u=g}} (NAS; TTAPS assumed {{val|2.25|e=14}}). The smoke resulting would be largely opaque to solar radiation but transparent to infrared, thus cooling the Earth by blocking sunlight, but not creating warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect. The optical depth of the smoke can be much greater than unity. Forest fires resulting from non-urban targets could increase aerosol production further. Dust from near-surface explosions against hardened targets also contributes; each megaton-equivalent explosion could release up to five million tons of dust, but most would quickly fall out; high altitude dust is estimated at 0.1–1 million tons per megaton-equivalent of explosion. Burning of crude oil could also contribute substantially.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Golitsyn, N.A. Phillips, ''Possible climatic consequences of a major nuclear war'', World Meteorological Organization, 1986{{better source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1-D radiative-convective models used in these{{which|date=October 2016}} studies produced a range of results, with coolings up to 15–42&amp;nbsp;°C between 14 to 35 days after the war, with a "baseline" of about 20&amp;nbsp;°C. Somewhat more sophisticated calculations using 3-D [[Global climate model|GCMs]] produced similar results: temperature drops of about 20&amp;nbsp;°C, though with regional variations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandrov and Stenchikov (1983); Covey, Schneider and Thompson (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

All{{which|date=October 2016}} calculations show large heating (up to 80&amp;nbsp;°C) at the top of the smoke layer at about {{Cvt|10|km|}}; this implies a substantial modification of the circulation there and the possibility of [[advection]] of the cloud into low latitudes and the southern hemisphere.

=== 1990 ===
In a 1990 paper entitled "Climate and Smoke: An Appraisal of Nuclear Winter", TTAPS gave a more detailed description of the short- and long-term atmospheric effects of a nuclear war using a three-dimensional model:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

First one to three months:
* 10–25% of soot injected is immediately removed by precipitation, while the rest is transported over the globe in one to two weeks
* SCOPE figures for July smoke injection:
** 22&amp;nbsp;°C drop in mid-latitudes
** 10&amp;nbsp;°C drop in humid climates
** 75% decrease in rainfall in mid-latitudes
** Light level reduction of 0% in low latitudes to 90% in high smoke injection areas
* SCOPE figures for winter smoke injection:
** Temperature drops between 3 and 4&amp;nbsp;°C

Following one to three years:
* 25–40% of injected smoke is stabilised in atmosphere (NCAR). Smoke stabilised for approximately one year.
* Land temperatures of several degrees below normal
* Ocean surface temperature between 2 and 6&amp;nbsp;°C
* Ozone depletion of 50% leading to 200% increase in UV radiation incident on surface.

One of the major results of TTAPS' 1990 paper was the re-iteration of the team's 1983 model that 100 [[oil refinery]] fires would be sufficient to bring about a small scale, but still globally deleterious nuclear winter.&lt;ref name="sgr.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgr.org.uk/resources/does-anybody-remember-nuclear-winter|title=Does anybody remember the Nuclear Winter? -|website=www.sgr.org.uk|access-date=2016-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216064753/http://www.sgr.org.uk/resources/does-anybody-remember-nuclear-winter|archive-date=2016-02-16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Iraq's [[invasion of Kuwait]] and Iraqi threats of igniting the country's approximately 800 oil wells, speculation on the cumulative climatic effect of this, presented at the [[World Climate Conference]] in Geneva that November in 1990, ranged from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy [[acid rain]] and even short term immediate global warming.&lt;ref name="eprints.kfupm.edu.sa"&gt;[http://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/6551/1/6551_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Kuwaiti Oil Fires – Modeling Revisited&lt;/ref&gt;

In articles printed in the [[Star-News|''Wilmington Morning Star'']] and the [[The Baltimore Sun|''Baltimore Sun'']] newspapers in January 1991, prominent authors of nuclear winter papers – Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Carl Sagan, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen – collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter like effects with continental-sized effects of sub-freezing temperatures as a result of the Iraqis going through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells that could subsequently burn for several months.&lt;ref name="eprints.kfupm.edu.sa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan|title=Page 1 of 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says|date=January 23, 1991|access-date=June 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006144456/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2148654&amp;dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires&amp;hl=en Wilmington morning Star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312090836/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2148654&amp;dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires&amp;hl=en |date=2016-03-12 }} January 21, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

As threatened, the wells were [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set on fire]] by the retreating Iraqis in March 1991, and the 600 or so burning oil wells were not fully extinguished until November 6, 1991, eight months after the end of the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_tabc.htm|title=TAB C – Fighting the Oil Well Fires|website=www.gulflink.osd.mil|access-date=2009-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220213449/http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_tabc.htm|archive-date=2015-02-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they consumed an estimated six million barrels of oil per day at their peak intensity.

When [[Operation Desert Storm]] began in January 1991, coinciding with the first few oil fires being lit, Dr. [[S. Fred Singer]] and [[Carl Sagan]] discussed the possible environmental effects of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, beginning around {{convert|48000|ft|m}} above sea level in Kuwait, resulting in global effects. He also argued that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|Tambora]] in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]".

Sagan listed modeling outcomes that forecast effects extending to South [[Asia]], and perhaps to the Northern Hemisphere as well. Sagan stressed this outcome was so likely that "It should affect the war plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~scranmer/SPD/crichton.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119014904/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~scranmer/SPD/crichton.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 January 2012|title=A lecture by Michael Crichton|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer, on the other hand, anticipated that the smoke would go to an altitude of about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} and then be rained out after about three to five days, thus limiting the lifetime of the smoke. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general,&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil" /&gt; lofting to about {{convert|10,000|ft|m}} and a few as high as {{convert|20,000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|title=The Kuwaiti Oil Fires|author=Hirschmann, Kris|publisher=Facts on File.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193647/http://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|archive-date=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The reference for this is a hardcopy transcript of the episode, excerpts on the Fred Singer talk page.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = First Israeli Scud Fatalities, Oil Fires in Kuwait | series = Nightline

Sagan and his colleagues expected that a "self-lofting" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere, a position where they argued it would take years for the sun-blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural effects in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title=Page 2 of 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991 |access-date=June 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006144456/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1992 follow-up, [[Peter V. Hobbs|Peter Hobbs]] and others had observed no appreciable evidence for the nuclear winter team's predicted massive "self-lofting" effect and the oil-fire smoke clouds contained less soot than the nuclear winter modelling team had assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-07-26/news/9207260223_1_nuclear-winter-carbon-dioxide-smoke|title=Kuwait Fires Failed To Bring Doomsday|access-date=2016-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202053517/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-07-26/news/9207260223_1_nuclear-winter-carbon-dioxide-smoke|archive-date=2017-02-02|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan later conceded in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' that his predictions obviously did not turn out to be correct: "it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6° C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=The demon-haunted world: science as a candle in the dark |publisher=Random House |location=New York |date=1996 |page=257 |isbn=978-0-394-53512-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of oil well and oil reserve smoke pluming into the stratosphere serving as a main contributor to the soot of a nuclear winter was a central idea of the early climatology papers on the hypothesis; they were considered more of a possible contributor than smoke from cities, as the smoke from oil has a higher ratio of black soot, thus absorbing more sunlight.&lt;ref name=crutzen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crutzen P. |author2=Birks J. |title=The atmosphere after a nuclear war: Twilight at noon |journal=Ambio |volume=11 |pages=114–25 |date=1982 |jstor=4312777 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.

Between 1990 and 2003, commentators noted that no peer-reviewed papers on "nuclear winter" were published.&lt;ref name="sgr.org.uk"/&gt;

Based on new work published in 2007 and 2008 by some of the authors of the original studies, several new hypotheses have been put forth, primarily the assessment that as few as 100 firestorms would result in a nuclear winter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="2008physicstoday"&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/ToonRobockTurcoPhysicsToday.pdf Environmental consequences of nuclear war] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312010114/http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/ToonRobockTurcoPhysicsToday.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }} by Owen B. Toon, Alan Robock, and Richard P. Turco. ''Physics Today'', December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, far from the hypothesis being "new", it drew the same conclusion as earlier 1980s models, which similarly regarded 100 or so city firestorms as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191488.pdf |title=An update of Soviet research on and exploitation of "Nuclear winter" 1984–1986, 16 September 1986, DNA-TR-86-404, p. 7 |access-date=12 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212740/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191488.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism.

Here we estimate the smoke generated from 100 low yield weapons being used on 100 targets."&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to climate change for the past millennium, even the smallest exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the [[Little Ice Age]] (the period of history between approximately 1600 and 1850 AD). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Robock|first1=Alan|last2=Toon|first2=Owen Brian|date=2012|title=Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear war|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockToonSAD.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|volume=68|issue=5|pages=68|via=SAGE|doi=10.1177/0096340212459127|bibcode=2012BuAtS..68e..66R|s2cid=14377214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors used a global circulation model, ModelE from the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]], which they noted "has been tested extensively in global warming experiments and to examine the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate." The model was used to investigate the effects of a war involving the entire current global nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 150 Tg of smoke into the atmosphere, as well as a war involving about one third of the current nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 50 Tg of smoke. In the 150 Tg case they found that:

{{quote|A global average surface cooling of −7 °C to −8 °C persists for years, and after a decade the cooling is still −4 °C (Fig. 2). Considering that the global average cooling at the depth of the last ice age 18,000 yr ago was about −5 °C, this would be a climate change unprecedented in speed and amplitude in the history of the human race. The temperature changes are largest over land … Cooling of more than −20 °C occurs over large areas of North America and of more than −30 °C over much of Eurasia, including all agricultural regions.}}

In addition, they found that this cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global precipitation by about 45%. As for the 50 Tg case involving one third of current nuclear arsenals, they said that the simulation "produced climate responses very similar to those for the 150 Tg case, but with about half the amplitude," but that "the time scale of response is about the same." They did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that "most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then" and commented that their own results show that, "This period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought."

Robock (2014), ''Earth's Future'', 2, {{DOI|10.1002/2013EF000205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors used computational models developed by NCAR to simulate the climatic effects of a soot cloud that they suggest would be a result of a regional nuclear war in which 100 "small" (15 Kt) weapons are detonated over cities. The model had outputs, due to the interaction of the soot cloud:

&lt;blockquote&gt;global ozone losses of 20–50% over populated areas, levels unprecedented in human history, would accompany the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1000 years. We calculate summer enhancements in UV indices of 30–80% over Mid-Latitudes, suggesting widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Killing frosts would reduce growing seasons by 10–40 days per year for 5 years. Surface temperatures would be reduced for more than 25 years, due to thermal inertia and albedo effects in the ocean and expanded sea ice. The combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 2018 ===
Researchers at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] published the results of a multi-scale study of the climate impact of a regional nuclear exchange, the same scenario considered by Robock et al. and by Toon et al. in 2007.  Unlike previous studies, this study simulated the processes whereby black carbon would be lofted into the atmosphere and found that very little would be lofted into the stratosphere and, as a result, the long-term climate impacts were much lower than those studies had concluded.  In particular, "none of the simulations produced a nuclear winter effect," and "the probability of significant global cooling from a limited exchange scenario as envisioned in previous studies is highly unlikely."&lt;ref&gt;[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JD027331 Climate Impact of a Regional Nuclear Weapons Exchange: An Improved Assessment Based On Detailed Source Calculations], Jon Reisner et. al, JGR Atmospheres, Volume 123, Issue 5, pp. 2752-2772.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the peer-reviewed journal ''Safety'' suggested that no nation should possess more than 100 nuclear warheads because of the blowback effect on the aggressor nation's own population because of "nuclear autumn".&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/morbid-researchers-imagine-a-best-case-scenario-for-nuc-1826776856 Morbid Researchers Imagine a 'Best-Case Scenario' for Nuclear War, and the Results Are Grim] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121203732/https://gizmodo.com/morbid-researchers-imagine-a-best-case-scenario-for-nuc-1826776856 |date=2018-11-21 }}, George Dvorsky, Gizmodo, 13 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Denkenberger|first1=David|last2=Pearce|first2=Joshua|last3=Pearce|first3=Joshua M.|last4=Denkenberger|first4=David C.|date=June 2018|title=A National Pragmatic Safety Limit for Nuclear Weapon Quantities|journal=Safety|volume=4|issue=2|pages=25|doi=10.3390/safety4020025|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2019 saw the publication of two studies on nuclear winter that build on previous modeling and describe new scenarios of nuclear winter from smaller exchanges of nuclear weapons than have been previously simulated.

As in the 2007 study by Robock ''et. al'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Robock|first1=Alan|last2=Oman|first2=Luke|last3=Stenchikov|first3=Georgiy L.|date=2007|title=Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|language=en|volume=112|issue=D13|doi=10.1029/2006JD008235|bibcode=2007JGRD..11213107R|issn=2156-2202|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2019 study by Coupe ''et. al'' models a scenario in which 150 Tg of black carbon is released into the atmosphere following an exchange of nuclear weapons between the United States in Russia where both countries use all of the nuclear weapons [[New START|treaties]] permit them to.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Coupe|first1=Joshua|last2=Bardeen|first2=C.|last3=Robock|first3=A.|last4=Toon|first4=O.|date=2019|title=Nuclear Winter Responses to Nuclear War Between the United States and Russia in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 4 and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=124|issue=15|pages=8522–8543|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nuclear-Winter-Responses-to-Nuclear-War-Between-the-Coupe-Bardeen/560033106c2d599bcace3ce4cb6c67d5b713ec50|doi=10.1029/2019JD030509|bibcode=2019JGRD..124.8522C|s2cid=200047350}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of black carbon far exceeds that which has been emitted in the atmosphere by all volcanic eruptions in the past 1200 years but is less than the asteroid impact which caused a mass extinction event 66 million years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Coupe ''et. al'' used the "[[Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model|whole atmosphere community climate model]] version 4" (WACCM4), which has a higher resolution and is more effective at simulating [[Aerosol|aerosols]] and stratospheric chemistry than the ModelE simulation used by Rocock ''et. al''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WACCM4 model simulates that black carbon molecules increase to ten times their normal size when they reach the stratosphere. ModelE did not account for this effect. This difference in black carbon particle size results in a greater [[optical depth]] in the WACCM4 model across the world for the first two years after the initial injection due to greater [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of sunlight in the stratosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This will have the effect of increasing stratospheric temperatures by 100K and result in ozone depletion that is slightly greater than ModelE predicted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another consequence of the larger particle size is accelerating the rate at which black carbon molecules fall out of the atmosphere; after ten years from the injection of black carbon into the atmosphere, WACCM4 predicts 2 Tg will remain, while ModelE predicted 19 Tg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2019 model and the 2007 model both predict significant temperature decreases across the globe, however the increased [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and particle simulation in 2019 predict a greater temperature anomaly in the first six years after injection but a faster return to normal temperatures. Between a few months after the injection to the sixth year of anomaly, the WACCM4 predicts cooler global temperatures than ModelE, with temperatures more than 20K below normal leading to freezing temperatures during the summer months over much of the northern hemisphere leading to a 90% reduction in agricultural growing seasons in the midlatitudes, including the midwestern United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; WACCM4 simulations also predict a 58% reduction in global annual precipitation from normal levels in years three and four after injection, a 10% higher reduction than predicted in ModelE.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Toon ''et. al'' simulated a nuclear scenario in 2025 where [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] engage in a nuclear exchange in which 100 urban areas in Pakistan and 150 urban areas in India are attacked with nuclear weapons ranging from 15 kt to 100 kt and examined the effects of black carbon released into the atmosphere from [[Air burst|airburst]]-only detonations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Toon|first1=Owen B.|last2=Bardeen|first2=Charles G.|last3=Robock|first3=Alan|last4=Xia|first4=Lili|last5=Kristensen|first5=Hans|last6=McKinzie|first6=Matthew|last7=Peterson|first7=R.

The ranges provided are large because neither India or Pakistan is obligated to provide information on their nuclear arsenals, so their extent remains largely unknown.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Toon ''et. al'' assume that either a [[firestorm]] or [[conflagration]] will occur after each detonation of the weapons, and the amount of black carbon inserted into the atmosphere from the two outcomes will be equivalent and of a profound extent;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in Hiroshima in 1945, it is predicted that the firestorm released 1000 times more energy than was released during the nuclear explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?author=O.+B.+Toon&amp;author=R.+P.+Turco&amp;author=A.+Robock&amp;author=C.+Bardeen&amp;author=L.+Oman&amp;author=G.+L.+Stenchikov&amp;title=Atmospheric+effects+and+societal+consequences+of+regional+scale+nuclear+conflicts+and+acts+of+individual+nuclear+terrorism&amp;publication_year=2007&amp;journal=Atmos.+Chem.+Phys.&amp;volume=7&amp;pages=1973-2002|access-date=2021-04-27|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a large area being burned would release large amounts of black carbon into the atmosphere. The amount released ranges from 16.1 Tg if all weapons were 15 kt or less to 36.6 Tg for all 100 kt weapons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For the 15 kt and 100kt range of weapons, the researchers modeled global precipitation reductions of 15% to 30%, temperature reductions between 4K and 8K, and ocean temperature decreases of 1K to 3K.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If all weapons used were 50 kt or more, [[Hadley cell]] circulation would be disrupted and cause a 50% decrease in precipitation in the American midwest. [[Primary sector of the economy|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) for oceans decreases from 10% to 20% for the 15 kt and 100 kt scenarios, respectively, while land NPP decreases between 15% and 30%; particularly affected are midlatitude agricultural regions in the United States and Europe, experiencing 25-50% reductions in NPP. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As predicted by other literature, once the black carbon is removed from the atmosphere after ten years, temperatures and NPP will return to normal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticism and debate==
The four major, largely independent underpinnings that the nuclear winter concept has and continues to receive criticism over, are regarded as:&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/nuclear-winter-theorists-pull-back.html?pagewanted=2|title=Nuclear Winter Theorists Pull Back|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne|access-date=2017-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519073506/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/nuclear-winter-theorists-pull-back.html?pagewanted=2|archive-date=2017-05-19|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1990-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; firstly, would cities readily [[firestorm]], and if so how much soot would be generated? Secondly, ''atmospheric'' longevity: would the quantities of soot assumed in the models remain in the atmosphere for as long as projected or would far more soot precipitate as [[firestorm|black rain]] much sooner? Third, ''timing'' of events: how reasonable is it for the modeling of firestorms or war to commence in late spring or summer (this is done in almost all US-Soviet nuclear winter papers, thereby giving rise to the largest possible degree of modeled cooling)? Lastly, the issue of ''[[Optical depth#Atmospheric sciences|darkness or opacity]]'': how much light-blocking effect the assumed quality of the soot reaching the atmosphere would have.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

While the highly popularized initial 1983 TTAPS 1-dimensional model forecasts were widely reported and criticized in the media, in part because every later model predicts far less of its "apocalyptic" level of cooling,&lt;ref&gt;[go.nature.com/yujz84 The Wall Street Journal, November 5, 1986 The Melting of 'Nuclear Winter' By Russell Seitz]&lt;/ref&gt; most models continue to suggest that some deleterious global cooling would still result, under the assumption that a large number of fires occurred in the spring or summer.&lt;ref name="sgr.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/88spp.html |title=Nuclear winter: science and politics |access-date=2006-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901020028/http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/88spp.html |archive-date=2006-09-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starley L. Thompson's less primitive mid-1980s [[global climate models|3-Dimensional]] model, which notably contained the very same general assumptions, led him to coin the term "nuclear autumn" to more accurately describe the climate results of the soot in this model, in an on camera interview in which he dismisses the earlier "apocalyptic" models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retroreport.org/video/nuclear-winter/|title=Nuclear Winter's Forecast of Doom Still Debated Today|date=3 April 2016|access-date=4 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410163333/http://www.retroreport.org/video/nuclear-winter|archive-date=10 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major criticism of the assumptions that continue to make these model results possible appeared in the 1987 book ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'' (''NWSS''), a [[civil defense]] manual by [[Cresson Kearny]] for the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="ORNL"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kearny | first=Cresson | title=Nuclear War Survival Skills | date=1987 | pages=17–19 | url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/ | isbn=978-0-942487-01-5 | publisher=Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine | location=Cave Junction, OR | author-link=Cresson Kearny | access-date=2008-04-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515172145/http://www.oism.org/nwss/ | archive-date=2008-05-15 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1988 publication ''An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war'', Kearny's criticisms were directed at the excessive amount of soot that the modelers assumed would reach the stratosphere. Kearny cited a Soviet study that modern cities would not burn as firestorms, as most flammable city items would be buried under non-combustible rubble and that the TTAPS study included a massive overestimate on the size and extent of non-urban wildfires that would result from a nuclear war.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt; The TTAPS authors responded that, amongst other things, they did not believe target planners would intentionally blast cities into rubble, but instead argued fires would begin in relatively undamaged suburbs when nearby sites were hit, and partially conceded his point about non-urban wildfires.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt; Dr. Richard D. Small, director of thermal sciences at the Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation similarly disagreed strongly with the model assumptions, in particular the 1990 update by TTAPS that argues that some 5,075 Tg of material would burn in a total US-Soviet nuclear war, as analysis by Small of blueprints and real buildings returned a maximum of 1,475 Tg of material that could be burned, "assuming that all the available combustible material was actually ignited".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Although Kearny was of the opinion that future more accurate models would "indicate there will be even smaller reductions in temperature", including future potential models that did not so readily accept that firestorms would occur as dependably as nuclear winter modellers assume, in ''NWSS'' Kearny did summarize the comparatively moderate cooling estimate of no more than a few days,&lt;ref name="ORNL" /&gt; from the 1986 ''Nuclear Winter Reappraised'' model&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Starley L &amp; Schneider, Stephen H [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20042777 Nuclear Winter Reappraised] in Foreign Affairs, Vol. 64, No. 5 (Summer, 1986), pp. 981–1005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thompson | first=Starley L. | author2=Stephen H.

This was done in an effort to convey to his readers that contrary to the popular opinion at the time, in the conclusion of these two climate scientists, "on scientific grounds the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishing low level of probability."&lt;ref name="ORNL" /&gt;

However, a 1988 article by Brian Martin in ''Science and Public Policy''&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; states that—although ''Nuclear Winter Reappraised'' concluded the US-Soviet "nuclear winter" would be much less severe than originally thought, with the authors describing the effects more as a "nuclear autumn"—other statements by Thompson and Schneider&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Schneider, letter, ''Wall Street Journal'', 25 November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Severe global-scale nuclear war effects reaffirmed', statement resulting from SCOPE-ENUWAR workshop in Bangkok, 9–12 February 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; show that they "resisted the interpretation that this means a rejection of the basic points made about nuclear winter". In the Alan Robock et al. 2007 paper, they write that "because of the use of the term 'nuclear autumn' by Thompson and Schneider [1986], even though the authors made clear that the climatic consequences would be large, in policy circles the theory of nuclear winter is considered by some to have been exaggerated and disproved [e.g., Martin, 1988]."&lt;ref name="2007abstract" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2007pdf" /&gt; In 2007 Schneider expressed his tentative support for the cooling results of the limited nuclear war (Pakistan and India) analyzed in the 2006 model, saying "The sun is much stronger in the tropics than it is in mid-latitudes. Therefore, a much more limited war [there] could have a much larger effect, because you are putting the smoke in the worst possible place", and "anything that you can do to discourage people from thinking that there is any way to win anything with a nuclear exchange is a good idea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2007/january10/schneidersr-011007.html Climate scientists describe chilling consequences of a nuclear war] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731151700/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2007/january10/schneidersr-011007.html |date=2011-07-31 }} by Brian D.

The contribution of smoke from the ignition of live non-desert vegetation, living forests, grasses and so on, nearby to many [[missile silo]]s is a source of smoke originally assumed to be very large in the initial "Twilight at Noon" paper, and also found in the popular TTAPS publication. However, this assumption was examined by Bush and Small in 1987 and they found that the burning of live vegetation could only conceivably contribute very slightly to the estimated total "nonurban smoke production".&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt; With the vegetation's potential to sustain burning only probable if it is within a [[Nuclear weapon yield#Yield limits|radius]] or two from the surface of the nuclear fireball, which is at a distance that would also experience extreme [[blast wave|blast winds]] that would influence any such fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00102208708952566 | volume=52 | issue=1–3 | title=A Note on the Ignition of Vegetation by Nuclear Weapons | year=1987 | journal=Combustion Science and Technology | pages=25–38 | last1 = Bush | first1 = B.

A paper by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], finalized in 2010, states that after a nuclear detonation targeting a city "If fires are able to grow and coalesce, a firestorm could develop that would be beyond the abilities of firefighters to control.

While approximately 8˚C of daytime summer cooling occurred under the smoke clouds during the weeks of burning, no increase in potentially devastating agricultural night frosts occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/323116a0 | volume=323 | issue=6084 | title=Siberian fire as "nuclear winter" guide | journal=Nature | pages=116–17 | year=1986 | last1 = Seitz | first1 = Russell| bibcode=1986Natur.323..116S | s2cid=4326470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his investigation into the Siberian fire of 1915, Seitz criticized the "nuclear winter" model results for being based on successive worst-case events:

Seitz cited Carl Sagan, adding an emphasis:  "''In almost any realistic case'' involving nuclear exchanges between the superpowers, global environmental changes sufficient to cause an extinction event equal to or more severe than that of the close of the [[Cretaceous]] when the dinosaurs and many other species died out are likely."

As the science progressed and more authentic sophistication was achieved in newer and more elegant models, the postulated effects headed downhill.  By 1986, these worst-case effects had melted down from a year of arctic darkness to warmer temperatures than the cool months in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]!  A new [[paradigm]] of broken clouds and cool spots had emerged.  The once global hard [[frost]] had retreated back to the northern [[tundra]].  Mr. Sagan's elaborate conjecture had fallen prey to [[Murphy's Law|Murphy's]] lesser-known Second Law:  If everything MUST go wrong, don't bet on it.&lt;ref name="textfiles.com"/&gt;}}

Seitz's opposition caused the proponents of nuclear winter to issue responses in the media. The proponents believed it was simply necessary to show only the possibility of climatic catastrophe, often a worst-case scenario, while opponents insisted that to be taken seriously, nuclear winter should be shown as likely under "reasonable" scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;p. 251 ''A Nuclear Winter's Tale'' Badash&lt;/ref&gt; One of these areas of contention, as elucidated by Lynn R. Anspaugh, is upon the question of which season should be used as the backdrop for the US-USSR war models. Most models choose the summer in the Northern Hemisphere as the start point to produce the maximum soot lofting and therefore eventual winter effect. However, it has been pointed out that if the same number of firestorms occurred in the autumn or winter months, when there is much less intense sunlight to loft soot into a stable region of the stratosphere, the magnitude of the cooling effect would be negligible, according to a January model run by Covey et al.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=940&amp;page=570|title=The Medical Implications of Nuclear War|date=1 January 1986|doi=10.17226/940|pmid=25032468|isbn=978-0-309-07866-5|author1=Institute of Medicine (US) Steering Committee for the Symposium on the Medical Implications of Nuclear War|last2=Solomon|first2=F.|last3=Marston|first3=R.

Anspaugh also expressed frustration that although a managed forest fire in Canada on 3 August 1985 is said to have been lit by proponents of nuclear winter, with the fire potentially serving as an opportunity to do some basic measurements of the optical properties of the smoke and smoke-to-fuel ratio, which would have helped refine the estimates of these critical model inputs, the proponents did not indicate that any such measurements were made.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Peter V. Hobbs]], who would later successfully attain funding to fly into and sample the smoke clouds from the Kuwait oil fires in 1991, also expressed frustration that he was denied funding to sample the Canadian, and other forest fires in this way.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt; Turco wrote a 10-page memorandum with information derived from his notes and some satellite images, claiming that the smoke plume reached 6&amp;nbsp;km in altitude.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt;

In 1986, atmospheric scientist [[Joyce E. Penner|Joyce Penner]] from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] published an article in ''Nature'' in which she focused on the specific variables of the smoke's optical properties and the quantity of smoke remaining airborne after the city fires. She found that the published estimates of these variables varied so widely that depending on which estimates were chosen the climate effect could be negligible, minor or massive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/324222a0 | title = Uncertainties in the smoke source term for 'nuclear winter' studies | volume=324 | issue = 6094 | journal=Nature | pages=222–26 | year=1986 | last1 = Penner | first1 = Joyce E.|author-link1=Joyce E.

===Critical response to the more modern papers===
In a 2011 response to the more modern papers on the hypothesis, Russell Seitz published a comment in ''Nature'' challenging Alan Robock's claim that there has been no real scientific debate about the "nuclear winter" concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/475037b | pmid=21734694 | volume=475 | issue=7354 | title=Nuclear winter was and is debatable | journal=Nature | page=37 | year=2011 | last1 = Seitz | first1 = Russell| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Seitz also contends that many others are reluctant to speak out for fear of being stigmatized as "closet [[Dr. Strangelove]]s", physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] of Princeton for example stated "It's an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.nature.com/yujz84|title=The Wall Street Journal, Wed., November 5, 1986 The Melting of 'Nuclear Winter' By Russell Seitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rocky Mountain News, Stephen Schneider had been called a fascist by some disarmament supporters for having written his 1986 article "Nuclear Winter Reappraised."&lt;ref name="ORNL" /&gt; [[MIT]] meteorologist [[Kerry Emanuel]] similarly wrote in a review in ''Nature'' that the winter concept is "notorious for its lack of scientific integrity" due to the unrealistic estimates selected for the quantity of fuel likely to burn, the imprecise global circulation models used. Emanuel ends by stating that the evidence of other models point to substantial scavenging of the smoke by rain.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/nuclear.pdf Nuclear winter, towards a scientific exercise. ''Nature'' Vol 319 No. 6051 p. 259, 23 Jan 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel also made an "interesting point" about questioning proponent's objectivity when it came to strong emotional or political issues that they hold.&lt;ref name="babel.hathitrust.org" /&gt;

== Policy implications ==
During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] called on the USSR to launch a nuclear [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] against the US in the event of a US invasion of Cuba.  In the 1980s, Castro was pressuring the Kremlin to adopt a harder line against the US under President [[Ronald Reagan]], even arguing for the potential use of nuclear weapons. As a direct result of this, a Soviet official was dispatched to Cuba in 1985 with an entourage of "experts", who detailed the ecological effect on Cuba in the event of nuclear strikes on the United States.  Soon after, the Soviet official recounts, Castro lost his prior "nuclear fever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter-url= http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb285/doc02_I_ch3.pdf| chapter = 3 | title = Evolution of soviet strategy | page = 24 | first = Andrian | last = Danilevich |access-date= 2016-12-05|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161101014139/http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb285/doc02_I_ch3.pdf |archive-date= 2016-11-01 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv//nukevault/ebb285/ Previously Classified Interviews with Former Soviet Officials Reveal U.S. Strategic Intelligence Failure Over Decades] {{Webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110805060352/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb285/ |date= 2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Alan Robock was summoned to Cuba to help Castro promote his new view that nuclear war would bring about Armageddon.

However, according to Robock, insofar as getting US government attention and affecting nuclear policy, he has failed. In 2009, together with [[Owen Toon]], he gave a talk to the [[United States Congress]], but nothing transpired from it and the then-presidential science adviser, [[John Holdren]], did not respond to their requests in 2009 or at the time of writing in 2011.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

In a 2012 "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists" feature, Robock and Toon, who had routinely mixed their disarmament advocacy into the conclusions of their "nuclear winter" papers,&lt;ref name="Robock"/&gt; argue in the political realm that the hypothetical effects of nuclear winter necessitates that the doctrine they assume is active in Russia and US, "[[mutually assured destruction]]" (MAD), should instead be replaced with their own "self-assured destruction" (SAD) concept,&lt;ref name= "RobockSAD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robock|first1=Alan|last2=Toon|first2=Owen B|title= Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear war|journal= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date= 2012 |volume=68|issue=5|pages=66–74|doi= 10.1177/0096340212459127|url=http://thebulletin.org/2012/september/self-assured-destruction-climate-impacts-nuclear-war|access-date=13 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031101/http://thebulletin.org/2012/september/self-assured-destruction-climate-impacts-nuclear-war|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|bibcode=2012BuAtS..68e..66R|s2cid= 14377214}}&lt;/ref&gt; because, regardless of whose cities burned, the effects of the resultant nuclear winter that they advocate would be, in their view, catastrophic. In a similar vein, in 1989 Carl Sagan and Richard Turco wrote a policy implications paper that appeared in ''AMBIO'' that suggested that as nuclear winter is a "well-established prospect", both superpowers should jointly reduce their nuclear arsenals to "[[Minimal deterrence|Canonical Deterrent Force]]" levels of 100–300 individual warheads each, such that in "the event of nuclear war [this] would minimize the likelihood of [extreme] nuclear winter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Policy Implications of Nuclear Winter|first1=Richard|last1=Turco|first2=Carl|last2=Sagan|date=13 September 1989|journal=Ambio|volume=18|issue=7|pages= 372–76|jstor=4313618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An originally classified 1984 US [[United States Intelligence Community|interagency intelligence]] assessment states that in both the preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the "''existing trends''" in [[Nuclear weapon design#Fusion-boosted fission weapons|warhead miniaturization]], of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads.&lt;ref name="DOC_0000284025 1984 page 20" /&gt; This is seen when assessing the most numerous [[physics package]]s in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the [[B28 nuclear bomb|B28]] and [[W31]], however, both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt [[W68]], the 100 Kt [[W76]] and in the 1980s, with the [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nuclearsecrecy.com/betas/yieldtoweight/|title=Yield-to-weight ratios |website= Nuclear secrecy |access-date= 2016-12-18|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161025101934/http://nuclearsecrecy.com/betas/yieldtoweight/|archive-date=2016-10-25|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in [[inertial guidance]] and accurate [[GPS]] navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more [[MIRV]] warheads and [[Penetration aid|decoys]] on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy [[missile silo|hardened targets]] but while reducing the severity of fallout [[collateral damage]] depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As it relates to the likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential [[Effects of nuclear explosions|thermal radiation]] ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt [[counterforce]] attack on [[ICBM]] sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of [[Michigan State University]] and [[Political Scientist|political scientist]] Stephen Cimbala of [[Pennsylvania State University]] argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with [[airburst|lower detonation heights]], could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, ''if'' the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan|target list]], as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings,&lt;ref name=" mitpress.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11897 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114008/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11897 |archive-date=2012-04-06 }} ''A Nuclear Winter's Tale: Science and Politics in the 1980s'', Lawrence Badash, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; while also temporarily lofting far more [[nuclear fallout|localized fallout]] when compared to [[airburst]] fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets.[[File:UncleNuclearTest1951.jpg|thumb|left|The 1951 ''[[Operation Buster-Jangle|Shot Uncle of Operation Buster-Jangle]]'', had a yield about a tenth of the 13 to 16 Kt Hiroshima bomb, 1.2 Kt,&lt;ref name="Jangle Uncle 2001"&gt;Some sources refer to the test as ''Jangle Uncle'' (e.g., Adushkin, 2001) or ''Project Windstorm'' (e.g., DOE/NV-526, 1998).

Thus a more [[psychological warfare|psychologically detering]] higher efficiency/higher yield device, can instead be constructed from the same mass of [[fissile material]].]] This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 ''Interagency Intelligence assessment'', which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors to reduce the amount of smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter.&lt;ref name="DOC_0000284025 1984 page 20" /&gt; Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and [[Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator|sub-surface bursts]], this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, ''local'' fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute ''global'' fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.&lt;ref name="mitpress.mit.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Altfeld and Cimbala also argued that belief in the possibility of nuclear winter would actually make nuclear war more likely, contrary to the views of Sagan and others, because it would serve yet further motivation to follow the ''existing trends'', towards the [[Circular error probable|development of more accurate]], and even lower explosive yield, nuclear weapons.{{Sfn | Badash | 2009 | p = 242}}   As the winter hypothesis suggests that the replacement of the then Cold War viewed [[strategic nuclear weapons]] in the multi-megaton yield range, with weapons of explosive yields closer to [[tactical nuclear weapons]], such as the [[Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator]] (RNEP), would safeguard against the nuclear winter potential. With the latter capabilities of the then, largely still conceptual RNEP, specifically cited by the influential nuclear warfare analyst [[Albert Wohlstetter]].{{Sfn | Badash | 2009 | pp = 238–39}} Tactical nuclear weapons, on the low end of the scale have yields that overlap with large [[conventional weapons]], and are therefore often viewed "as blurring the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons", making the prospect of using them "easier" in a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://congressionalresearch.com/RL32130/document.php|title=Nuclear Weapon Initiatives: Low-Yield R&amp;D, Advanced Concepts, Earth Penetrators, Test Readiness |website= Congressional research |access-date=2014-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109095233/http://congressionalresearch.com/RL32130/document.php|archive-date=2014-11-09|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/07/22/S8717_national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year/ National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805023431/http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/07/22/S8717_national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year/ |date=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged Soviet exploitation===
{{See also|Soviet influence on the peace movement#Claims of wider Soviet influence}}
In an interview in 2000 with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985–91), the following statement was posed to him: "In the 1980s, you warned about the unprecedented dangers of nuclear weapons and took very daring steps to reverse the arms race", with Gorbachev replying "Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on Earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act in that situation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2000/09/07/gorbachev/ Mikhail Gorbachev explains what's rotten in Russia] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090210165853/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2000/09/07/gorbachev/ |date=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 1984 US Interagency Intelligence Assessment expresses a far more skeptical and cautious approach, stating that the hypothesis is not scientifically convincing. The report predicted that Soviet [[nuclear policy]] would be to maintain their strategic nuclear posture, such as their fielding of the high [[throw-weight]] [[SS-18]] missile and they would merely attempt to exploit the hypothesis for propaganda purposes, such as directing scrutiny on the US portion of the [[nuclear arms race]]. Moreover, it goes on to express the belief that if Soviet officials did begin to take nuclear winter seriously, it would probably make them demand exceptionally high standards of scientific proof for the hypothesis, as the implications of it would undermine their [[military doctrine]] – a level of scientific proof which perhaps could not be met without field experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000284025.pdf|title=Interagency Intelligence Assessment (1984): The Soviet Approach to Nuclear Winter | pages = 18–19 |access-date=2014-06-12|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130718020015/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000284025.pdf|archive-date=2013-07-18 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The un-redacted portion of the document ends with the suggestion that substantial increases in Soviet Civil defense food stockpiles might be an early indicator that Nuclear Winter was beginning to influence Soviet upper [[wikt:echelon|echelon]] thinking.&lt;ref name= "DOC_0000284025 1984 page 20"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000284025.pdf|title=Interagency Intelligence Assessment (1984): The Soviet Approach to Nuclear Winter | page = 20 |access-date=2014-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718020015/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000284025.pdf|archive-date=2013-07-18|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine noted "the suspicions of some Western scientists that the nuclear winter hypothesis was promoted by Moscow to give [[campaign for nuclear disarmament|anti-nuclear groups]] in the U.S. and Europe some fresh ammunition against America's arms buildup."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob V. Lamar Jr., David Aikman and Erik Amfitheatrof, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040755/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,960025,00.html "Another Return from the Cold"], ''Time'', Monday, Oct. 7, 1985 &lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the [[United States Senate]] met to discuss the science and politics of nuclear winter. During the congressional hearing, the influential analyst [[Leon Gouré]] presented evidence that perhaps the Soviets have simply echoed Western reports rather than producing unique findings. Gouré hypothesized that Soviet research and discussions of nuclear war may serve only Soviet political agendas, rather than to reflect actual opinions of Soviet leadership.&lt;ref&gt;United States.

U.S. G.P.O., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the [[Defense Nuclear Agency]] document ''An update of Soviet research on and exploitation of Nuclear winter 1984–1986'' charted the minimal [public domain] research contribution on, and Soviet propaganda usage of, the nuclear winter phenomenon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191488.pdf |title=An update of Soviet research on and exploitation of Nuclear winter 1984–1986 |access-date=2014-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212740/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191488.pdf |archive-date= 2014-07-14 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some doubt as to when the Soviet Union began modelling fires and the atmospheric effects of nuclear war. Former Soviet intelligence officer [[Sergei Tretyakov (intelligence officer)|Sergei Tretyakov]] claimed that, under the directions of [[Yuri Andropov]], the [[KGB]] invented the concept of "nuclear winter" in order to stop the deployment of NATO [[Pershing II]] missiles. They are said to have distributed to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal ''Ambio'' disinformation based on a faked  "doomsday report" by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] by Georgii Golitsyn, [[Nikita Moiseyev]] and Vladimir Alexandrov concerning the climatic effects of nuclear war.&lt;ref name= "Comrade J"&gt;Pete Earley, "Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia's Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War", Penguin Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-399-15439-3}}, pp. 167–77&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is accepted that the Soviet Union exploited the nuclear winter hypothesis for propaganda purposes,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Tretyakov's inherent claim that the KGB funnelled disinformation to ''AMBIO'', the journal in which Paul Crutzen and John Birks published the 1982 paper "Twilight at Noon", has not been corroborated {{As of|2009|lc= y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y8M5vx-Lrk0C |title= A Nuclear Winter's Tale | publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology |access-date=2016-06-04 |isbn= 978-0-26225799-2 |last1= Badash |first1= Lawrence |date= 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2009 conducted by the [[National Security Archive]], Vitalii Nikolaevich Tsygichko (a Senior Analyst at the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] and military mathematical modeler) stated that Soviet military analysts were discussing the idea of "nuclear winter" years before U.S. scientists, although they did not use that exact term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv//nukevault/ebb285/ |title=Candid Interviews with Former Soviet Officials Reveal U.S. Strategic Intelligence Failure Over Decades | publisher = GWU |access-date= 2012-05-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110805060352/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb285/ |archive-date= 2011-08-05|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mitigation techniques ==
{{See also|Conflict Resolution}}
A number of solutions have been proposed to mitigate the potential harm of a nuclear winter if one appears inevitable. The problem has been attacked at both ends; some solutions focus on preventing the growth of fires and therefore limiting the amount of smoke that reaches the stratosphere in the first place, and others focus on food production with reduced sunlight, with the assumption that the very worst-case analysis results of the nuclear winter models prove accurate and no other mitigation strategies are fielded.

=== Fire control ===
In a report from 1967, techniques included various methods of applying liquid nitrogen, dry ice, and water to nuclear-caused fires.&lt;ref&gt;W. E. Shelberg and E. T. Tracy. "Countermeasure Concepts for Use Against Urban Mass Fires From Nuclear Weapon Attack" U.S. Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory, San Francisco, California 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The report considered attempting to stop the spread of fires by creating [[firebreak]]s by blasting combustible material out of an area, possibly even using nuclear weapons, along with the use of preventative [[Controlled burn|Hazard Reduction Burns]]. According to the report, one of the most promising techniques investigated was [[cloud seeding|initiation of rain from seeding]] of mass-fire thunderheads and other clouds passing over the developing, and then stable, firestorm.

=== Producing food without sunlight ===

In the book ''[[Feeding Everyone No Matter What]]'', under the worst-case scenario predictions of nuclear winter, the authors present various unconventional food possibilities.

There is however the danger that if a sudden rush to food stockpiling occurs without the buffering effect offered by [[Victory garden]]s etc., it may exacerbate current [[food security]] problems by elevating present food prices.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

== Climate engineering ==
{{See also|Anti-greenhouse effect}}
Despite the name "nuclear winter", nuclear events are not necessary to produce the modeled climatic effect.&lt;ref name="climate.envsci.rutgers.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 242–44, ''A Nuclear Winter's Tale'' by Lawrence Badas&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to find a quick and cheap solution to the global warming projection of at least 2 ˚C of surface warming as a result of the doubling in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels within the atmosphere, through [[solar radiation management]] (a form of climate engineering) the underlying nuclear winter effect has been looked at as perhaps holding potential. Besides the more common suggestion to inject [[stratospheric sulfur injection|sulfur compounds into the stratosphere]] to approximate the effects of a volcanic winter, the injection of other chemical species such as the release of a particular type of soot particle to create minor "nuclear winter" conditions, has been proposed by Paul Crutzen and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Albedo Enhancement by Stratospheric Sulfur Injections: A Contribution to Resolve a Policy Dilemma?

Similar climatic effects to "nuclear winter" followed historical [[supervolcano]] eruptions, which plumed [[sulfate aerosol]]s high into the stratosphere, with this being known as a [[volcanic winter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/628515.stm|title=Supervolcanoes could trigger global freeze|publisher=BBC|date=February 3, 2000|access-date=April 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014214504/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/628515.stm|archive-date=October 14, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of smoke in the atmosphere (short wave absorption) are sometimes termed an "antigreenhouse" effect, and a strong analog is the hazy atmosphere of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

Similarly, extinction-level [[Impact event|comet and asteroid impacts]] are also believed to have generated [[impact winter]]s by the [[rock crusher|pulverization]] of massive amounts of fine rock dust. This pulverized rock can also produce "volcanic winter" effects, if [[sulfate]]-bearing rock is hit in the impact and lofted high into the air,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2008/01/seismic-images-show-dinosaur-killing-meteor-made-bigger-splash/ |title=Seismic Images Show Dinosaur-Killing Meteor Made Bigger Splash |date=January 1, 2008 |author=Marc Airhart |access-date=November 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220175132/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2008/01/seismic-images-show-dinosaur-killing-meteor-made-bigger-splash/ |archive-date=December 20, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "nuclear winter" effects, with the heat of the heavier rock [[ejecta]] igniting regional and possibly even global forest firestorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comet Caused Nuclear Winter |journal=Discover |date=January 2005 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jan/comet-caused-nuclear-winter |access-date=2008-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517085337/http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jan/comet-caused-nuclear-winter |archive-date=2008-05-17 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/05/63613|title=A Fiery Death for Dinosaurs?|author=Amit Asaravala|magazine=Wired|date=May 26, 2004|access-date=March 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130010854/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/05/63613|archive-date=January 30, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This global "impact firestorms" hypothesis, initially supported by Wolbach, H. Jay Melosh and Owen Toon, suggests that as a result of massive impact events, the small [[sand grain|sand-grain]]-sized ejecta fragments created can [[meteor]]ically [[re-entry|re-enter]] the atmosphere forming a hot blanket of global debris high in the air, potentially turning the entire sky [[incandescence|red-hot]] for minutes to hours, and with that, burning the complete global inventory of above-ground carbonaceous material, including [[rain forests]].&lt;ref name="geology.gsapubs.org"&gt;[http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/12/1147.short Reigniting the Cretaceous-Palaeogene Firestorm Debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125233941/http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/12/1147.short |date=2015-01-25 }} Claire M.

In part due to the [[Cretaceous period]] being a high-[[Paleoclimatology|atmospheric-oxygen era]], with concentrations above that of the present day. Owen Toon et al. in 2013 were critical of the re-evaluations the hypothesis is undergoing.&lt;ref name="Robertson, D.S. 2013" /&gt;

It is difficult to successfully ascertain the percentage contribution of the soot in this period's [[stratigraphy|geological sediment]] record from living plants and fossil fuels present at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soot in Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary clays worldwide: is it really derived from fossil fuel beds close to Chicxulub?|first=Pavle|last=Premović|date=1 January 2012|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=4|issue=3|page=383|doi=10.2478/s13533-011-0073-8|bibcode=2012CEJG....4..383P|s2cid=128610989}}&lt;/ref&gt; in much the same manner that the fraction of the material ignited directly by the meteor impact is difficult to determine.
