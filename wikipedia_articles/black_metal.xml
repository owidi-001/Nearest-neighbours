'''Black metal''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. Common traits include [[Tempo#Beats per minute|fast tempos]], a [[Screaming (music)#Black metal|shrieking]] vocal style,&lt;ref name=metalsucks&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/08/vons-satanic-blood-black-black-black-black-no-1/ | title=Von's Satanic Blood: Black Black Black Black No. 1 | publisher=[[MetalSucks]] | date=8 November 2012 | access-date=8 May 2013 | author=O'Hagar, Sammy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=inri-mw0000243175|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( I.N.R.I. &gt; Overview ))) |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sputnikmusic&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Channing|title=Album Review – Darkthrone: A Blaze in the Northern Sky|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/54469/Darkthrone-A-Blaze-in-the-Northern-Sky/|website=[[Sputnikmusic]]|access-date=22 January 2013|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; heavily distorted [[Electric guitar|guitars]] played with [[tremolo picking]], raw ([[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]) recording, unconventional [[song structure]]s, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in [[corpse paint]] and adopt pseudonyms.

During the 1980s, several [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]] bands formed a prototype for black metal.&lt;ref name="Stylus Magazine"/&gt; This "first wave" included bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]].&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |last=Dunn |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |type=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[Gorgoroth]]. The [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave, the second generation in Sweden being led by [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]],&lt;ref name="patterson342"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Dayal |author-link=Dayal Patterson |title=Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult |publisher=Feral House |year=2013 |pages=342 |isbn=9781936239764 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kIxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA342 |access-date=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abruptum]],&lt;ref name="patterson342"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ekeroth |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Ekeroth |title=Swedish Death Metal |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |year=2009 |pages=255 |isbn=9780979616310 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA255 |access-date=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]],&lt;ref name="patterson342"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ekeroth |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Ekeroth |title=Swedish Death Metal |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |year=2009 |pages=225 |isbn=9780979616310 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA225 |access-date=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ekeroth |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Ekeroth |title=Swedish Death Metal |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |year=2009 |pages=253 |isbn=9780979616310 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA253 |access-date=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nifelheim]].&lt;ref name="patterson342"/&gt;

Some artists express [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] views, and others advocating various forms of extreme [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian sentiment]], [[Satanism]], or [[Ethnic religion|ethnic]] [[paganism]]. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of [[#Church burnings|church burnings]] and murders.

== Characteristics ==
Although ''contemporary black metal'' typically refers to the Norwegian style with shrieking vocals and raw production, the term has traditionally been applied to bands with widely differing sounds, such as [[Death SS]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]],&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=emperor10&gt;''Emperor''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greek and Finnish bands that emerged around the same time as the Norwegian scene.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;

=== Instrumentation and song structure ===

Norwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched or [[Treble (sound)|trebly]] guitar tones and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} The guitar is usually played with fast, un-[[Palm mute|muted]] [[tremolo picking]] and [[power chord]]s.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |access-date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |access-date=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831140019/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |archive-date=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarists often use [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]—along with specific [[Musical scale|scales]], [[Interval (music)|intervals]] and chord progressions—to create a sense of dread. The [[tritone]], or flat-fifth, is often used. [[Guitar solo]]s and low [[guitar tunings]] are rare in black metal.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; The [[bass guitar]] is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass to be muted against the guitar,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; or for it to [[Homophony|homophonically]] follow the low-pitched riffs of the guitar. While electronic keyboards are not a standard instrument, some bands, like [[Dimmu Borgir]], use keyboards "in the background" or as "proper instruments" for creating atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. p. 301"&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013. p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Some newer black metal bands began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even [[orchestra]]s.

The [[Drum kit|drumming]] is usually fast and relies on [[Heel-toe technique|double-bass]] and [[blast beat]]s to maintain tempos that can sometimes approach 300 beats per minute. These fast tempos require great skill and physical stamina, typified by black metal drummers Frost ([[Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad]]) and Hellhammer ([[Jan Axel Blomberg]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe-Young, Garry: ''Rockdetector A-Z of Black Metal''; 2001, Cherry Red Books, London, UK; p. i.&lt;/ref&gt; Even still, [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is still prioritized over technique. "This professionalism has to go," insists well-respected drummer and metal historian [[Fenriz]] (Gylve Fenris Nagell) of [[Darkthrone]]. "I want to ''de-learn'' playing drums, I want to play primitive and simple, I don't want to play like a drum solo all the time and make these complicated riffs".&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal: ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''; 2013, Feral House, Port Townsend, Washington; p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black metal songs often stray from [[Song structure (popular music)|conventional song structure]] and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections. The Greek style—established by [[Rotting Christ]], [[Necromantia]] and Varathron&lt;ref&gt;J. Campbell: [http://www.nwnprod.com/?p=2078 ''Varathron "Genesis of the Unaltered Evil" DLP/Triple LP and TS Out Now''], 30 January 2012, accessed on 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—has more [[traditional metal|traditional heavy metal]]&lt;ref name=Bowar/&gt; and [[death metal]]&lt;ref name=Glas/&gt; traits than Norwegian black metal.

[[File:Gorgoroth I.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of Gorgoroth wearing typical black metal gear such as corpse paint, spikes and bullet belts. The band was formed by guitarist [[Infernus (musician)|Infernus]] to express his [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gorgoroth.org/band/band.html |title = Bio/Manifesto |publisher = Gorgoroth official website |quote = "Gorgoroth was founded by Infernus in 1992 as a strategy to perpetrate sonic and spiritual violence upon the world in order to bring forth change in peoples perception of being therein. Thus, through metal music, Satans minister on earth summoned an avatara of the forces of darkness and did let it manifestate through a variety of attempts on creating what was perceived as ultimate black metal taking form on stage as well as in a variety of studio recordings. [...] With the devoted presence of the new full time members Gaahl and King, as well as a not a day too early achieved social and mental fundament for future work, a deal was inked with the german label Nuclear Blast and the band to a bigger extent adopted the position as a live performance act taking upon them several tours worldwide bringing its sinister presence and the word of Satan to new territories..." |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021010859/http://www.gorgoroth.org/band/band.html |archive-date=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Vocals and lyrics ===

Traditional black metal bands tend to favor raspy, high-pitched vocals which include techniques such as shrieking, screaming, and snarling,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; a vocal style influenced by [[Quorthon]] of [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} [[Death growl]]s, common in the [[death metal]] genre, are sometimes used, but less frequently than the characteristic black metal shriek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2jPtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT458|publisher = SAGE|date = 19 January 2015|isbn = 9781473914407|first1 = Andy|last1 = Bennett|first2 = Steve|last2 = Waksman|page = 458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deleuze and Music|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MkpsrsmYPv0C&amp;pg=PA107|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|date = 1 January 2004|isbn = 9780748618699|first1 = Ian|last1 = Buchanan|first2 = Marcel|last2 = Swiboda|page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black metal lyrics typically attack Christianity and the other institutional religions,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; often using apocalyptic language. [[Satanism|Satanic]] lyrics are common,&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Dome |first=Michael |author-link=Malcolm Dome |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |type=motion picture |time={{time needed|date=October 2018}} |publisher=Rockworld TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many see them as essential to black metal. For Satanist black metal artists, "Black metal songs are meant to be like Calvinist sermons; deadly serious attempts to unite the true believers".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=25}} [[Misanthropy]], [[global catastrophe]], war, death, destruction and rebirth are also common themes.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Another topic often found in black metal lyrics is that of the wild and extreme aspects and phenomena of the natural world, particularly the wilderness, forests, mountains, winter, storms, and blizzards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=V.|year=2014|title=A Winterhorde in a Ravenrealm: Immortal's lyrics as an expression of Northeroic Gothic|url=https://media.wix.com/ugd/c8fb40_5a122829af3a422fb718923030522f22.pdf|journal=Aeternum: The Journal of Contemporary Gothic Studies|volume=1 |issue=2|pages=40–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black metal also has a fascination with the distant past. Many bands write about the mythology and folklore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Musical Style, Ideology, and Mythology in Norwegian Black Metal (Book chapter in: Metal Rules the Globe: Heavy Metal Music Around the World)|last=Hagen|first=Ross|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2011|location=Durham, NC, USA|pages=180–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their homelands and promote a revival of pre-Christian, pagan traditions. A significant number of bands write lyrics only in their native language and a few (e.g. [[Arckanum]] and early [[Ulver]]) have lyrics in archaic languages. Some [[doom metal]]-influenced artists' lyrics focus on depression, nihilism, introspection, self-harm and suicide.&lt;ref name=AE&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Ebner |first=Arne |date=25 July 2010 |title=Ästhetik des Doom |type=Bachelor |institution=Macromedia University of Applied Sciences for Media and Communication – Cologne |url=http://doom.resettheworld.com/aesthetik_des_doom_arne_ebner_40mb.pdf |access-date=18 August 2018 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075156/http://doom.resettheworld.com/aesthetik_des_doom_arne_ebner_40mb.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sil|first1=Janet|editor1-last=Ishmael|editor1-first=Amelia|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Zareen|editor3-last=Stephanou|editor3-first=Aspasia|editor4-last=Woodward|editor4-first=Ben|title=Open a Vein: Suicidal Black Metal and Enlightenment|journal=Helvete: A Journal of Black Metal Theory|date=2013|issue=1|pages=5–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNR9GGaUkTQC&amp;pg=PA5|publisher=Punctum Books|location=Brooklyn|isbn=9780615758282|issn=2326-683X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feral&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Dayal|title=Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult|date=2013|publisher=Feral House|location=Port Townsend|isbn=9781936239757|page=351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kIxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imagery and performances ===

Many bands choose not to play live.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Spermeth: ''Besessen von der Dunkelheit und dem Bösen''. In: ''Ablaze'', no. 5, May/June 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=putrid&gt;Ben Ratliff: [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ''Thank You, Professor, That Was Putrid'']. In: ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who do play live maintain that their performances "are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, [[Authenticity (philosophy)#In music|authenticity]] and extremity are valued above all else".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Gorgoroth]], and [[Watain]] are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock crucifixions, medieval weaponry and band members doused in animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Aftenposten Norway, Norwegian news in English |last=Tisdall |first=Jonathan |date=4 February 2004 |work=aftenposten.no |access-date=4 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archive-date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few vocalists, such as [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Dead]], [[Sven Erik Kristiansen|Maniac]] and [[Niklas Kvarforth|Kvarforth]], are known for [[Self-harm|cutting themselves]] while singing onstage.

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; and [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]] and inverted [[pentagram]]s to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint—black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.

The imagery of black metal reflects its lyrics and ideology. In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').

=== Production ===
The earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive "lo-fi" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more "raw" or "cold".&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says "represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal."&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, "Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

== History ==
The conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a "first wave", and that a "second wave" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist Dead;&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} and Darkthrone's album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.&lt;ref name=paganfront&gt;[[Hendrik Möbus]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&amp;article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen: [https://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Darkthrone''. ''A Blaze in the Northern Sky''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some who argue that albums like [[Sarcófago]]'s ''[[I.N.R.I. (Sarcófago album)|I.N.R.I.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mersus: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Samael (band)|Samael]]'s ''[[Worship Him]]''&lt;ref&gt;sG: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; began the second wave.

=== Roots ===
Occult and Satanic lyrical themes were present in the music of heavy metal and rock bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s such as [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Coven (band)|Coven]].&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013. pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, the form of rough and aggressive heavy metal played by the British band [[Motörhead]] gained popularity.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt; Many first wave black metal bands would cite Motörhead as an influence.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt; Also popular in the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] came to influence the birth of black metal.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt; [[Tom G. Warrior]] of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English punk group [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] as "a revolution, much like Venom", saying, "When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far."&lt;ref&gt;J. Bennett, "Procreation of the Wicked", ''Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces'', Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, pp. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of corpse paint in the black metal imagery was mainly influenced by the American 1970s [[rock music|rock]] band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt;

=== First wave ===

[[File:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Venom's second album, ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'', inspired the name of the genre]]

The first wave of black metal refers to bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. By today's musical standards, their sound is closer to [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]].&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] rather than black metal by today's standards,&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

Another major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created "the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return……]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988). With ''Blood Fire Death'' and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as [[Viking metal]].

[[Hellhammer]], from Switzerland, "made truly raw and brutal music"&lt;ref name=ekeroth244&gt;Daniel Ekeroth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second edition. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 244, accessed on 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; with Satanic lyrics, and became an important influence on later black metal;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=10}} "Their simple yet effective riffs and fast guitar sound were groundbreaking, anticipating the later trademark sound of early Swedish death metal".&lt;ref name=ekeroth244/&gt; In 1984, members of Hellhammer formed [[Celtic Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triptykon.net/vcf/band/biography.html ''Biography''], accessed on 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; whose music "explored more orchestral and experimental territories. The lyrics also became more personal, with topics about inner feelings and majestic stories. But for a couple of years, Celtic Frost was one of the world's most extreme and original metal bands, with a huge impact on the mid-1990s black metal scene".&lt;ref name=ekeroth244/&gt;

The Danish band [[Mercyful Fate]] influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=14-16}} Frontman [[King Diamond]], who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, may be one of the inspirators of what became known as 'corpse paint'.

=== Second wave ===
{{Main|Early Norwegian black metal scene}}

[[File:Immortal Getaway Rock Festival.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Norwegian band Immortal influenced countless bands in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/immortal/p/immortal.htm |title=Immortal |publisher=[[About.com]] |last=Marsicano |first=Dan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602232143/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/immortal/p/immortal.htm |archive-date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During {{nowrap|1990–1993}}, a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], and [[Gorgoroth (band)|Gorgoroth]]. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by [[Snorre Ruch|Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch]] of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of Mayhem.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; [[Fenriz]] of Darkthrone described it as being "derived from Bathory"&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".&lt;ref name=revolver&gt;Kory Grow: [http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva.html ''WEB-EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DARKTHRONE'S FENRIZ, PART 2! HIS THOUGHTS ON 'TRANSILVANIAN HUNGER' AND HIP''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The wearing of [[corpse paint]] became standard, and was a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The scene also had an ideology and ethos. Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27, 33, 41}} They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them. [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that they sought to "create fear among people"{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=222}} and "be in opposition to society".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=218f}} The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those who were "true" and attempting to expel all "[[poseur]]s".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=30, 42}} Some members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murder, which eventually drew attention to it and led to a number of artists being imprisoned.

==== Dead's suicide ====
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Per Yngve Ohlin]] (who called himself "Dead") died by suicide while alone in a house shared by the band.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Mayhem's drummer, [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]], said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive corpse paint that became widespread in the scene.&lt;ref name=basik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |title=Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998 |last=Basik |first=Dmitri |date=June 1998 |work=thetruemayhem.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823184104/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |archive-date=23 August 2007 |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head. Dead's suicide note began with "Excuse all the blood", and apologized for firing the weapon indoors.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=62}} Before calling the police, Euronymous got a disposable camera and photographed the body,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=49}} after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album, ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=basik/&gt;

Euronymous made necklaces with bits of Dead's skull and gave some to musicians he deemed worthy.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;!--this has been confirmed by others--&gt; Rumors also spread that he had made a stew with bits of his brain.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's evil image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become trendy and commercialized.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=59-60}} Mayhem bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud]] noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Adrian "The Energizer" |title=Mayhem: To Hell and Back |journal=Unrestrained |issue=15 |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823101847/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archive-date=23 August 2007 |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During May–June 1991,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=66}} Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named "[[Helvete (store)|Helvete]]" ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for "Hell") at Schweigaards gate 56 in [[Oslo]]. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian black metal scene".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} In its basement, Euronymous founded an [[independent record label]] named [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

==== Church burnings ====
[[File:Bergen, Fantoft2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Fantoft stave church]] &lt;!-- Please add a picture of one of the churches burning, if possible --&gt;&lt;!-- A photograph of MZ.412's ''Burning the Temple of God'' (not all pressings), Absurd's ''Facta Loquuntur'' (1999 picture LP and maybe other pressings), Lord Belial's ''Purify Sweden'' or of the ''Lords of Chaos'' book cover should do. The destroyed church on Burzum's ''Aske'' is also worth being depicted. --&gt;]]

In 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene began a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 such attacks in Norway.&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. The first to be burnt down was Norway's [[Fantoft stave church]]. Police believe [[Varg Vikernes]] of Burzum was responsible.&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; The cover of Burzum's EP ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]'' ("ashes") is a photograph of the destroyed church. In May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty for burning down [[Holmenkollen Chapel]], Skjold Church and [[Old Åsane Church|Åsane Church]].&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=93}} To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. The musicians [[Faust (musician)|Faust]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=94f}} [[Samoth]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} (both of Emperor) and [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] (of [[Hades Almighty]]){{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}}&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish scene started to burn churches in 1993.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=269f}}

Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic "retaliation" against Christianity in Norway.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=89}} Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, on the basis that they were more foreign.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=105}} Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them".&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and [[Abbath]] of Immortal,&lt;ref name=sam /&gt; see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were "just people trying to gain acceptance" within the black metal scene.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; [[Watain]] vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: "the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course".&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica&gt;''Black Metal Satanica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not remove these tags --&gt;

==== Murder of Euronymous ====
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=117}} On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. When they arrived a confrontation began and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at outdoing a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust.&lt;ref name=ukcrlz&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105103704/http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 January 2013 |title=Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music |work=yahoo.com |date=10 August 1993 |access-date=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II – Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; He also claims that most of the cuts were from broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by Faust,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=123}} while [[Necrobutcher]] confirmed that Vikernes killed Euronymous in self-defense due to the death threats he received from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campion |first=Chris |date=20 February 2005 |title=In the face of death |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/20/popandrock4 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=30 December 2018 |quote='Øystein was always sending death threats to people,' says Necro Butcher. 'It was his reaction to everything. But he didn't put so much into it. And then when he met you, he was like, "OK. You're cool!". Then you were best friends. So when eventually he got to be unfriendly with Varg, he threatened him like he did everyone else. Øystein told him, "I'm going to send some people to torture you. Until you die." But Varg Vikernes saw this as a real threat. He probably thought, "better him than me. I'll just go down and do him".'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993, in Bergen.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=120}} Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} That month saw the release of Mayhem's album ''De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'', which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts. But I never did".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to Tønsberg prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berglund |first=Nina |date=27 October 2003 |title=Police Nab 'The Count' After He Fled Jail |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308164838/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archive-date=8 March 2007 |access-date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes was released on [[parole]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Varg Vikernes ute på prøve |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |location=[[Oslo]], Norway |agency=[[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] |date=10 March 2009 |access-date=5 September 2012 |language=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312054544/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 |url-status=live |archive-date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ute av fengsel |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ |work=dagbladet.no |date=22 May 2009 |access-date=23 May 2009 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outside Norway ====

[[File:Enthroned 201107 Paris 07.jpg|thumb|left|[[Enthroned]] from Belgium]]

Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In Poland, a scene was spearheaded by [[Graveland]] and [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]].&lt;!-- These bands became enemies later, Darken gathering an arising NSBM scene around himself and Graveland. Patterson wrote about this. --&gt; In France, a close-knit group of musicians known as [[Les Légions Noires]] emerged; this included artists such as [[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]], Belketre and Torgeist. In Belgium, there were acts such as [[Ancient Rites]] and [[Enthroned]]. Bands such as [[Black Funeral]], [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] emerged during this time in the United States. Black Funeral, from [[Houston]], formed in 1993, was associated with [[black magic]] and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="paganbelial.awardspace.com"&gt;[http://paganbelial.awardspace.com/?p=841 ''Black Funeral''.

[[File:Cradle of Filth 2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|English band Cradle of Filth performing at [[Metalmania]] in 2005]]

A notable black metal group in England was [[Cradle of Filth]], who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by the album ''[[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh]]'', which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and [[gothic metal]]. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Gavin |last2=Filth |first2=Dani |author-link2=Dani Filth |title=[[The Gospel of Filth]] |date=March 2010 |pages=48–50 |publisher=FAB Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the most successful [[extreme metal]] bands to date. John Serba of [[AllMusic]] commented that their first album "made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-principle-of-evil-made-flesh-mw0000025519 |title=The Principle of Evil Made Flesh – Cradle of Filth |last=Serba |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some black metal fans did not consider Cradle of Filth to be black metal. When asked if he considers Cradle of Filth a black metal band, vocalist [[Dani Filth]] said he considers them black metal in terms of philosophy and atmosphere, but not in other ways.{{sfn|Partridge|Christianson|2014|p=42}} Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but "began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area" and "almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=316-318}} [[Dayal Patterson]] says successful acts like Cradle of Filth "provoked an even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground" scene due to concerns about "[[selling out]]".&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013"&gt;Patterson, Dayal.

The controversy surrounding the Thuringian&lt;!-- You may also write "East German" or whatever.--&gt; band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] drew attention to the German black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=272}} A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]: ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity''. NYU Press, 2003. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus.&lt;ref&gt;Absurd: ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', Capricornus Prod. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's early music was more influenced by [[Oi!]] and [[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) than by black metal,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=250f}} and described as being "more akin to '60s [[garage punk]] than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=295}} [[Alexander von Meilenwald]] from German band [[Nagelfar]] considers [[Ungod (band)|Ungod]]'s 1993 debut ''Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts'', [[Desaster]]'s 1994 demo ''Lost in the Ages'', [[Tha-Norr]]'s 1995 album ''Wolfenzeitalter'', [[Lunar Aurora]]'s 1996 debut ''Weltengänger'' and [[Katharsis (band)|Katharsis]]'s 2000 debut ''666''&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Meilenwald: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; to be the most important recordings for the German scene.&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt; He said they were "not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something".&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt;

=== After the second wave ===

[[File:DimmuBorgirTuska2005.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Dimmu Borgir's music features synthesizers and orchestras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dimmu-borgir-mn0000214580 |title=Dimmu Borgir |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as [[Alan Averill|Alan 'Nemtheanga' Averill]] says, "you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing."&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] said that "black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country".&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"&gt;{{cite video |title=[[Satan rir media|Satan Rides the Media]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even full-symphony [[orchestra]]s.

After Euronymous's death, "some bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss."&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; Since 1993, the Swedish scene had carried out church burnings, grave desecration, and other violent acts.

[[File:Watain3.jpg|thumb|[[Watain]] singer Erik Danielsson in torn clothes and covered with blood]]
According to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998, there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and [[Ondskapt]], supposedly inspired by [[Ofermod]],&lt;ref&gt;Nathan T.

A part of the underground scene adopted a [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of [[Allerseelen (band)|Allerseelen]] and the authors of ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' had implied in their writings.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=176f}}&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; They mixed this interpretation with Paganism and Nationalism.&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; Varg Vikernes was seen as "an ideological messiah" by some,&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm&gt;J.

In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), an NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in [[Toulon]] in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in [[Mulhouse]] on Christmas Eve 1996.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=312-315}} According to MkM of [[Antaeus (band)|Antaeus]] and Aosoth, the early French scene "was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM, and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions, and you had that 'cult' aura", whereas his band Antaeus, not belonging to either of these sub-scenes, "did not fit anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Ankit: [http://infernal-dominion.blogspot.de/2011/08/interview-with-mkm-from-antaeus-and.html ''Interview with MKM from Antaeus and Aosoth (French Black Metal)''], 23 August 2011, accessed on 31 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many French bands, like [[Deathspell Omega]] and Aosoth, have an avantgarde approach&lt;ref&gt;Jan Jaedike: ''Merrimack''.

The early American black metal bands remained underground. Some of them—like [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]]—joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot's sole member Akhenaten left the organization.&lt;ref name=mh82007&gt;Gunnar Sauermann: ''Special: Black Metal in den USA''.

In Australia, a scene led by bands like [[Deströyer 666]], [[Vomitor]], [[Hobbs' Angel of Death]], [[Nocturnal Graves]] and [[Gospel of the Horns]] arose. This scene's typical style is a mixture of old school black metal and raw thrash metal influenced by old Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom, and Sodom but also with its own elements.&lt;ref&gt;Götz Kühnemund: ''Gospel of the Horns''.

Since the 2000s, a number of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] and [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] black metal bands—whose members come from Muslim backgrounds—have emerged in the Middle East. Janaza, believed to be Iraq's first female black metal artist, released the demo ''Burning Quran Ceremony'' in 2010. Its frontwoman, Anahita, claimed her parents and brother were killed by a [[suicide bomb]] during the [[Iraq War]]. Another Iraqi band, Seeds of Iblis, also fronted by Anahita,&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;Kelly, Kim.

Another Lebanese band, [[Ayat (band)|Ayat]], drew much attention with their debut album ''Six Years of Dormant Hatred'', released through North American label Moribund Records in 2008.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Some European bands have also begun expressing anti-Islamic views, most notably the Norwegian band [[Taake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.no/20120105/anti-islam-lyrics-no-barrier-to-norway-music-prize- |title=Anti-Islam lyrics no barrier to Norway music prize |website=[[The Local]] |date=6 January 2012 |access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stylistic divisions ==

Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: "those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements".&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The former believe that the music should always be [[Minimalism|minimalist]]—performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a [[Lo-fi music|low fidelity]] style. One supporter of this train of thought is [[Blake Judd]] of [[Nachtmystium]], who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=208961 |title=Daily Herald &amp;#124; Nachtmystium shines black light on black metal |last=Pizek |first=Jeff |date=20 June 2008 |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|dailyherald.com]] |access-date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snorre Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is "too narrow" and believes that this was "not the idea at the beginning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/thorns.htm |title=Thorns |work=voicesfromthedarkside.de |access-date=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801091047/http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/thorns.htm |archive-date=1 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres:

{{dynamic list}}

===Ambient black metal===
Ambient black metal is a style of black metal which relies on heavy incorporation of atmospheric, sometimes dreamy textures, and is therefore less aggressive. It often features synthesizers or classical instrumentation, typically for melody or ethereal "shimmering" over the wall of sound provided by the guitars. The music is usually slow to mid paced with rare blast beat usage, without any abrupt changes and generally features slowly developing, sometimes repetitive melodies and riffs, which separate it from other black metal styles. Subject matter usually concerns nature, folklore, mythology, and personal introspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/beautiful-brutality/Content?oid=1109755|title = Beautiful Brutality|date = 22 May 2008|access-date = 14 March 2015|website = [[Chicago Reader]]|publisher = [[Wrapports]]|last = Raymer|first = Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists include [[Agalloch]]&lt;ref name="ABM"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/agalloch-reluctant_kings|title = Agalloch Reluctant Kings|date = 23 May 2014|access-date = 18 June 2015|website = Exclaim!|last = Walschots|first = Natalie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wolves in the Throne Room]].&lt;ref name="ABM"/&gt;

===Black-doom===
Black-doom, also known as blackened doom, is a style that combines the slowness and thicker, bassier sound of [[doom metal]] with the shrieking vocals and heavily distorted guitar sound of black metal.&lt;ref name=AE/&gt;&lt;ref name="FTBD"&gt;{{cite web |author=Newshound, Terrorizer |title=ITALIAN BLACKENED DOOMSTERS FORGOTTEN TOMB PLAN RELEASE |url=http://truecultheavymetal.com/blog1.php/2010/09/23/italian-blackened-doomsters-forbidden-tomb-plan-release |publisher=[[Terrorizer (magazine)#Terrorizer Online|Terrorizer Online]] |access-date=29 January 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718185027/http://www.terrorizer.com/blog1.php/2010/09/23/italian-blackened-doomsters-forbidden-tomb-plan-release |archive-date=18 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marsicano, Dan |title=Ordo Obsidium – Orbis Tertius Review |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/ordoobsidium/fr/Ordo-Obsidium-Orbis-Tertius-Review.htm |publisher=[[About.com]] |access-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324005658/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/ordoobsidium/fr/Ordo-Obsidium-Orbis-Tertius-Review.htm |archive-date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black-doom bands maintain the Satanic ideology associated with black metal, while melding it with moodier themes more related to doom metal, like depression, nihilism and nature.&lt;ref Name=AE/&gt; They also use the slower pace of doom metal in order to emphasize the harsh atmosphere present in black metal.&lt;ref Name=RS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.de/das-archiv/article237260/print/emotionen-in-zeitlupe.html|title=Emotionen in Zeitlupe |author1=Zahn, Thorsten |author2=Schurer, Petra |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=1 June 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112141913/http://www.rollingstone.de/das-archiv/article237260/print/emotionen-in-zeitlupe.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|access-date=18 August 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of black-doom bands include [[Barathrum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tiira.cedunet.com/~ilwakka/barathrum/reviews.html |title=REVIEWS |access-date=10 November 2020 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128010428/http://tiira.cedunet.com/~ilwakka/barathrum/reviews.html |archive-date=28 January 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forgotten Tomb]],&lt;ref name="FTBD"/&gt; [[Woods of Ypres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Newshound, Terrorizer |title=WOODS OF YPRES RELEASE DISCUSS THE GREEN ALBUM |url=http://truecultheavymetal.com/blog1.php/2011/03/21/woods-of-ypres-release-discuss-the-green-album |publisher=[[Terrorizer (magazine)#Terrorizer Online|Terrorizer Online]] |access-date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deinonychus (band)|Deinonychus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DEINONYCHUS: 'You Will Get A Pure Black/Doom Metal Album' |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deinonychus-you-will-get-a-pure-black-doom-metal-album/ |work=[[Blabbermouth]] |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shining (Swedish band)|Shining]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Dayal|title=Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult|year=2013|publisher=Feral House|isbn=978-1936239757|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kIxCgAAQBAJ|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nortt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nortt – Endeligt Review|last=Obstkrieg|first=Dan|url=https://yourlastrites.com/2018/01/12/nortt-endeligt-review/ |publisher=Last Rites|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethlehem (band)|Bethlehem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BETHLEHEM REPLACE LIFELOVER ON BILL FOR KINGS OF BLACK METAL FESTIVAL|url=http://bravewords.com/news/bethlehem-replace-lifelover-on-bill-for-kings-of-black-metal-festival|publisher=Brave Words|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; early [[Katatonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Katatonia: 'Brave Murder Day' |url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/hall-of-fame/katatonia/ |work=[[Decibel Magazine]] |access-date=27 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709015700/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/hall-of-fame/katatonia/ |archive-date=9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]],&lt;ref Name=RS/&gt; [[Dolorian]],&lt;ref Name=RS/&gt; and [[October Tide]].&lt;ref Name=RS/&gt;

Crust punk groups, such as [[Antisect]], [[Sacrilege (band)|Sacrilege]] and [[Anti System]] took some influence from [[#First wave|early black metal]] bands like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Hellhammer]], and [[Celtic Frost]],&lt;ref name="Rise of Crust"&gt;{{cite web|last=Von Havoc |first=Felix |title=Rise of Crust |publisher=Profane Existence |date=1 January 1984 |url=http://www.havocrex.com/press/article/3/83 |access-date=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615163312/http://www.havocrex.com/press/article/3/83 |archive-date=15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Amebix]]'s lead vocalist and guitarist sent his band's early demo tape to [[Conrad Lant|Cronos]] of Venom, who replied by saying "We'll rip you off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunlap |first1=Xander |title=Directionless people are malleable—easily pointed in the wrong directions |url=http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/music-interviews/amebix/ |website=[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] was initially inspired by crust punk as well as heavy metal.&lt;ref&gt;Ekeroth, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is dubious, whom does he mention? Quorthon mentioned GBH as an influence, i. e. hardcore, not crust. --&gt; Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of [[#Second wave|second wave black metal]]-influenced crust punk;&lt;ref name=iskra&gt;[http://iskra.ws/interviews.html Iskra Interviews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615141533/http://iskra.ws/interviews.html |date=15 June 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Iskra coined their own phrase "blackened crust" to describe their new style. The Japanese group [[Gallhammer]] also fused crust punk with black metal&lt;ref&gt;"Hard of Hearing", ''Terrorizer'' no. 171, June 2008, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; while the English band Fukpig has been said to have elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supersonicfestival.com/2010/line-up/events/fukpig|title=Fukpig|publisher=[[Terrorizer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"C: Do you think that FUKPIG has founded a style of his own?

As Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,
{{quote|In a very ironic paradox, black metal and crust punk have recently started to embrace one another. Members of Darkthrone and Satyricon have lately claimed that they love punk, while among crusties, black metal is the latest fashion. In fact, the latest album by crust punk band [[Skitsystem]] sounds very black metal—while the latest black metal opus by Darkthrone sounds very punk! This would have been unimaginable in the early 90s.|&lt;ref name=Ekeroth258&gt;Ekeroth, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===National Socialist black metal===
{{main|National Socialist black metal}}
National Socialist black metal (also known as NSBM) is a subgenre that promotes [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] or similar beliefs through its lyrics and imagery. Artists typically meld neo-Nazi ideology with ethnic European paganism, but a few meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism. Some commentators see this ideology as a natural development of the black metal worldview. Members of the early Norwegian scene flirted with Nazi themes, but this was largely an attempt to provoke.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=101}} Varg Vikernes—who now refers to his ideology as '[[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odalism]]'&lt;ref name=burzum.org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VII – The Nazi Ghost |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |author-link=Varg Vikernes |date=July 2005 |work=burzum.org |access-date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is credited with popularizing such views within the scene.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=103}} NSBM emerged in the mid-1990s and was spearheaded by artists such as [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] (from Germany), [[Graveland]], [[Infernum]], and Veles (from Poland), and [[Grand Belial's Key]] (from the US).

Unblack metal (or Christian black metal) is a subgenre that promotes Christianity through its lyrics and imagery.&lt;ref name=kapelovitz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kapelovitz |first=Dan |date=February 2001 |title=Heavy Metal Jesus Freaks – Headbanging for Christ |journal=Mean Magazine |url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |access-date=6 September 2007 |quote=And where secular black metal thrived, so did its Christian counterpart, unblack metal, with names like [[Satanicide]], Neversatan, and Satan's Doom. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805040049/http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |archive-date=5 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first unblack metal record, ''[[Hellig Usvart]]'' (1994) by Australian artist [[Horde (band)|Horde]], was a provocative parody of Norwegian black metal. It sparked controversy, and death threats were issued against Horde. Norwegian unblack metal band [[Antestor]] was originally formed as a [[death/doom]] band bearing a different name, Crush Evil.

== Ideology ==
[[File:Taake Hellfest 2009 8 NB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Taake]] vocalist Hoest—the [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted Christian cross]] is often used by black-metallers to signify their opposition to Christianity]]

Unlike other metal genres, black metal is associated with an ideology and ethos. It is fiercely [[anti-Christian sentiment|opposed to Christianity]]&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; and the other main [[Organized religion|institutional religions]], [[Criticism of Islam|Islam]] and [[Criticism of Judaism|Judaism]]. Many black metal bands are [[Satanism|Satanists]] and see Satanism as a key part of black metal. Others advocate ethnic Paganism, "often coupled with nationalism",{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=359}} although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt;&lt;ref name=enslavedfrost/&gt;&lt;ref name=nordicmetal/&gt;

Black metal tends to be [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and hostile to modern society.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; It is "a reaction against the mundanity, insincerity and emotional emptiness that participants feel is intrinsic to modern secular culture".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=37}} The black metal scene tends to oppose [[political correctness]], [[humanitarianism]], [[consumerism]], [[globalization]] and homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=David |editor=Ullrich Kockel |title=A Companion to the Anthropology of Europe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=2012 |pages=437 |chapter=Chapter 25: Extreme Neo-nationalist Music Scenes at the Heart of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manea |first=Irina-Maria |date=16 April 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzcnCAAAQBAJ |title=Primal Roots: Ancestry and Race in Extreme Music Discourses |journal=Proceedings of IAC-SSaH 2015: International Academic Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities in Prague 2015 |publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education |pages=186–187, 190 |isbn=9788090579125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noys |first=Benjamin |editor=Nicola Masciandaro |title=Hideous Gnosis: Black Metal Theory Symposium |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_GCM2MFeJwfMC |publisher=Glossator |date=2010 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_GCM2MFeJwfMC/page/n116 106]–108 |chapter='Remain True to the Earth!': Remarks on the Politics of Black Metal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Weaver from [[Wolves in the Throne Room]] said: "I think that black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/05/an_interview_w_13.html |title=An Interview w/ Wolves in the Throne Room's Aaron Weaver |date=22 May 2009 |work=brooklynvegan.com |access-date=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121175804/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/05/an_interview_w_13.html |archive-date=21 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this, some parts of the scene glorify nature and have a fascination with the distant past.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=2}}&lt;ref name=chonicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |access-date=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831140019/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |archive-date=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black metal has been likened to [[Romanticism]] and there is an undercurrent of [[romantic nationalism]] in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Van Young, Adrian.

However, it is argued that followers of Euronymous were anti-individualistic,{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} and that "Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=2}}

In his master's thesis, Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that some artists can be seen as [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalists]]. Dissatisfied with a "world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance",{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=129}} they try to leave or "transcend" their "mundane physical forms" and become one with the divine.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=4}} This is done through their concerts, which he describes as "musical rituals" that involve self-mortification and taking on an alternative, "spiritual persona" (for example by the wearing of costume and face paint).{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=50}}

=== Satanism ===
[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|150px|right|The inverted [[pentagram]] is commonly used by bands in the genre]]

Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery. However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls "one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=16}}

In the early 1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} They attacked the Church of Satan for its "freedom and life-loving" views;&lt;ref name=killyourself2&gt;Esa Lahdenpera: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html ''Northern Black Metal Legends'']. In: ''Kill Yourself'', no. 2, August 1993. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theistic Satanism]] they espoused was an inversion of Christianity. Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they "transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism" and "abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} Some prominent scene members—such as Euronymous and Faust&lt;ref name=emperor10/&gt;&lt;ref name=killyourself/&gt;—stated that only bands who are Satanists can be called 'black metal'. Bands with a Norwegian style, but without Satanic lyrics, tended to use other names for their music.&lt;ref name=halupczok&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halupczok |first=Marc |title=Waldschrate &amp; Met-Trinker |journal=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=March 2010 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enslavedfrost&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Frost (album)|Frost]] |type=CD liner notes |publisher=[[Osmose Productions]] |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nordicmetal&gt;{{cite book |title=Nordic Metal – A Tribute to Euronymous |type=CD liner notes |publisher=[[Necropolis Records]] |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is still held by many artists—such as [[Infernus]],&lt;ref name=infernus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_interviews_infernus_gorgoroth.html |title=live-metal.net – Interviews: Gorgoroth – Infernus |last=Maki |first=Jeff |date=18 July 2006 |work=live-metal.net |access-date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Rostén|Arioch]],&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rape: ''Funeral Mist''.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Lars Stokstad &amp; Thor Georg Buer EoR2011.jpg|thumb|130px|right|The Norwegian unblack metal band [[Antestor]].]]

Many black-metallers see "Christian black metal" as an oxymoron&lt;ref name=ultimatemetal/&gt; and believe black metal cannot be Christian.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music "black metal" because they did not share its ethos.

== Politics ==
A wide range of political views are found in the black metal scene. The vast majority of black metal bands are not openly political, although there is said to be an undercurrent of [[romantic nationalism|romantic]] and [[ethnic nationalism]] in black metal.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=349-355}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trafford |first1=Simon |last2=Pluskowski |first2=Aleks |editor-last=Marshall |editor-first=David W. |year=2007 |title=Antichrist Superstars: The Vikings in Hard Rock and Heavy Metal |url=https://www.academia.edu/521897 |journal=Mass Market Medieval: Essays on the Middle Ages in Popular Culture |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |pages=64 |isbn=978-0-7864-2922-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gardell307&gt;[[Mattias Gardell|Gardell, Mattias]].

Albeit still being a small minority within the genre,&lt;ref name=gardell307/&gt;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=123f}} Neo-Nazi artists gained some notoriety throughout the years.

Some time later, a movement promoting marxist and anarchist ideas was born in the genre, mostly as a reaction to neo-Nazi movements.&lt;ref name="panopticon"/&gt; Others with similar outlook, such as Wolves in the Throne Room, are not overtly political and do not endorse the label.
