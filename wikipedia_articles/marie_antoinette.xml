'''Marie Antoinette''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|t|w|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|,_|ˌ|ɒ̃|t|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-12-539683-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|maʁi ɑ̃twanɛt|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Exilexi-Marie-Antoinette.wav}}; born '''Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna'''; 2 November 1755 – 16 October 1793) was the last [[queen of France]] before the [[French Revolution]]. She was born an [[archduchess of Austria]] and was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of [[Empress Maria Theresa]] and [[Emperor Francis I]]. She became [[dauphine of France]] in May 1770 at age 14 upon her marriage to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis-Auguste]], heir apparent to the French throne. On 10 May 1774, her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI and she became queen.

Marie Antoinette's position at court improved when, after eight years of marriage, she started having children. She became increasingly unpopular among the people, however, with the French [[libelles]] accusing her of being profligate, promiscuous, harboring sympathies for France's perceived enemies—particularly her native Austria—and her children of being illegitimate. The false accusations of the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]] damaged her reputation further. During the Revolution, she became known as ''Madame Déficit'' because the country's financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to the social and financial reforms of [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Jacques Necker|Necker]].

Several events were linked to Marie Antoinette during the Revolution after the government had placed the royal family under house arrest in the [[Tuileries Palace]] in October 1789. The June 1791 attempted [[flight to Varennes]] and her role in the [[War of the First Coalition]] had disastrous effects on French popular opinion. On [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]], the attack on the Tuileries forced the royal family to take refuge at the [[National Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]], and they were imprisoned in the [[Temple Prison]] on 13 August. On 21 September 1792, the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|monarchy was abolished]]. Louis XVI was executed by [[guillotine]] on 21 January 1793. Marie Antoinette's trial began on 14 October 1793, and two days later she was convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] of high treason and executed, also by guillotine, on the [[Place de la Révolution]].

Maria Antonia was born on 2 November 1755 at the [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna, Austria. She was the youngest daughter of [[Empress Maria Theresa]], ruler of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], and her husband [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her godparents were [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] and [[Mariana Victoria of Spain|Mariana Victoria]], King and Queen of Portugal; Archduke [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]] and Archduchess [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1738–1789)|Maria Anna]] acted as proxies for their newborn sister.&lt;ref name="Fraser 2002 5–6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2002|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liaisons"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michel|last=de Decker|title=Marie-Antoinette, les dangereuses liaisons de la reine|publisher=Belfond|location=Paris, France|date=2005|isbn=978-2714441416|pages=12–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Antonia was born on [[All Souls' Day|All Souls Day]], a Catholic day of mourning, and during her childhood her birthday was instead celebrated the day before, on [[All Saints' Day|All Saint's Day]], due to the connotations of the date. Shortly after her birth she was placed under the care of the governess of the imperial children, Countess von Brandeis.&lt;ref name="d'Armaillé"&gt;{{cite book|first=Marie Célestine Amélie|last=de Ségur d'Armaillé|title=Marie-Thérèse et Marie-Antoinette|publisher=[[Editions Didier Millet]]|date=1870|location=Paris, France|pages=34, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Antonia was raised together with her sister, [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina]], who was three years older, and with whom she had a lifelong close relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Antonia had a difficult but ultimately loving relationship with her mother,&lt;ref name="Fraser 2001 166–170"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=22–23, 166–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; who referred to her as "the little Madame Antoine".

Maria Antonia spent her formative years between the Hofburg Palace and [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]], the imperial summer residence in Vienna,&lt;ref name="liaisons"/&gt; where on 13 October 1762, when she was seven, she met [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], two months her junior and a child prodigy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philippe|last=Delorme|author-link=Philippe Delorme|title=Marie-Antoinette.

Under the teaching of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], Maria Antonia developed into a good musician. She learned to play the [[harp]],&lt;ref name="Cronin 1989 45"/&gt; the [[harpsichord]] and the flute. She sang during the family's evening gatherings, as she had a beautiful voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1989|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also excelled at dancing, had "exquisite" poise, and loved dolls.&lt;ref name="Weber2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2007}}{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1768, [[Mathieu-Jacques de Vermond]] was dispatched by Louis XV to tutor Marie Antoinette as she became the future wife to Louis XVI. Serving as an educator, Abbe de Vermond found her to be unsatisfactorily educated and lacking in, at the age of 13, important writing skills. Nonetheless, he also complimented her stating "her character, her heart, are excellent." He found her "more intelligent than has been generally supposed," but since "she is rather lazy and extremely frivolous, she is hard to teach."&lt;ref name="Marie Antoinette"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/marie-antoinette-134629573/|title=Marie Antoinette |date=November 2006|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dauphine of France (1770–1774)==
[[File:Cérémonie du mariage du Dauphin de France Louis-Auguste, futur Louis XVI.jpg|thumb|Marriage of Marie Antoinette with Louis-Auguste celebrated in the [[Royal Chapel of Versailles]] by the [[Charles Antoine de La Roche-Aymon|Archbishop-Duke of Reims]] on 16 May 1770]]

Following the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[Diplomatic Revolution]] of 1756, Empress Maria Theresa decided to end hostilities with her longtime enemy, King [[Louis XV of France]]. Their common desire to destroy the ambitions of [[Prussia]] and [[Great Britain]] and to secure a definitive peace between their respective countries led them to seal their alliance with a marriage: on 7 February 1770, Louis XV formally requested the hand of Maria Antonia for his eldest surviving grandson and heir, Louis-Auguste, [[duc de Berry]] and Dauphin of France.&lt;ref name="liaisons"/&gt;

[[File:Marie Antoinette by Joseph Ducreux.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marie Antoinette at the age of thirteen; this miniature portrait was sent to the Dauphin to show him what his future bride looked like (by [[Joseph Ducreux]], 1769)]]

Maria Antonia formally renounced her rights to [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] domains, and on 19 April she was [[Proxy marriage|married by proxy]] to the Dauphin of France at the [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|Augustinian Church]] in Vienna, with her brother [[Ferdinand, Duke of Breisgau|Archduke Ferdinand]] standing in for the Dauphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pierre Nolhac|La Dauphine Marie Antoinette,1929|pp=46–48|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liaisons"/&gt; On 14 May she met her husband at the edge of the [[forest of Compiègne]]. Upon her arrival in France, she adopted the French version of her name: Marie Antoinette. A further ceremonial wedding took place on 16 May 1770 in the [[Palace of Versailles]] and, after the festivities, the day ended with the [[Bedding ceremony|ritual bedding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nolhac|1929|pp=55–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's longtime failure to [[consummate]] the marriage plagued the reputations of both Louis-Auguste and Marie Antoinette for the next seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alfred et Geffroy D'Arneth| Correspondance Secrete entre Marie-Therese et le Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, vol 3|1874|pp=80–90, 110–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial reaction to the marriage between Marie Antoinette and Louis-Auguste was mixed. On the one hand, the Dauphine was beautiful, personable, and well-liked by the common people. Her first official appearance in Paris on 8 June 1773 was a resounding success. On the other hand, those opposed to the alliance with Austria had a difficult relationship with Marie Antoinette, as did others who disliked her for more personal or petty reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Antoinette in a red hunting habit-1772.jpg|thumb|Marie Antoinette in hunting attire, one of her mother's favorite portraits of her daughter (by Joseph Krantzinger, 1771)]]

[[Madame du Barry]] proved a troublesome foe to the new dauphine. She was Louis XV's mistress and had considerable political influence over him. In 1770 she was instrumental in ousting [[Étienne François, Duc de Choiseul]], who had helped orchestrate the Franco-Austrian alliance and Marie Antoinette's marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in exiling his sister, the duchess de Gramont, one of Marie Antoinette's ladies-in-waiting. Marie Antoinette was persuaded by her husband's aunts to refuse to acknowledge du Barry, which some saw as a political blunder that jeopardized Austria's interests at the French court. Marie Antoinette's mother and the Austrian ambassador to France, [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau|comte de Mercy-Argenteau]], who sent the Empress secret reports on Marie Antoinette's behavior, pressured Marie Antoinette to speak to Madame du Barry, which she grudgingly agreed to do on New Year's Day 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|ALfred and Geffroy d'Arneth|1874|pp=65–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; She merely commented to her, "There are a lot of people at Versailles today", but it was enough for Madame du Barry, who was satisfied with this recognition, and the crisis passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the death of Louis XV in 1774, Louis XVI exiled du Barry to the Abbaye de Pont-aux-Dames in [[Meaux]], pleasing both his wife and aunts.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, ''Marie Antoinette'', 2001, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackes Levron|Madame du Barry|1973|pp=75–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evelyne Lever|Marie Antoinette|1991|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goncourt 1880, pp. 195–196"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edmond de|last=Goncourt|title=La Du Barry|editor-first=G.|editor-last=Charpentier|location=Paris, France|date=1880|pages=195–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lever, Evelyne, ''Louis XV'', Fayard, Paris, 1985, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Two and a half years later, at the end of October 1776, Madame du Barry's exile ended and she was allowed to return to her beloved château at [[Louveciennes]], but she was never permitted to return to Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Vatel|title=Histoire de Madame du Barry: d'après ses papiers personnels et les documents d'archives|publisher=Hachette Livre|location=Paris, France|date=1883|isbn=978-2013020077|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen of France and Navarre (1774–1791)==

===Early years (1774–1778)===
[[File:Josef Hauzinger 002.jpg|thumb|[[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria]] visits Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI on 7 February 1775 at the [[Château de la Muette]] (painting by the Austrian portraitist Josef Hauzinger)]]

Upon the death of Louis XV on 10 May 1774, the Dauphin ascended the throne as King Louis XVI of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] with Marie Antoinette as his Queen. At the outset, the new queen had limited political influence with her husband, who, with the support of his two most important ministers, Chief Minister [[Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas|Maurepas]] and Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]], blocked several of her candidates from assuming important positions, including [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=136–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arneth and Geffroy ii|1874|pp=475–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The queen did play a decisive role in the disgrace and exile of the most powerful of Louis XV's ministers, the [[Emmanuel-Armand de Richelieu, duc d'Aiguillon|duc d'Aiguillon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=André|last=Castelot|title=Marie-Antoinette|publisher=Librairie académique Perrin|location=Paris, France|date=1962|isbn=978-2262048228|pages=107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=124–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|Marie Antoinette 1991|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 1774, two weeks after the death of Louis XV, the king gifted his wife the [[Petit Trianon]], a small château on the grounds of Versailles that had been built by Louis XV for his mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour]]. Louis XVI allowed Marie Antoinette to renovate it to suit her own tastes; soon rumors circulated that she had plastered the walls with gold and diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Antoinette Young7.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Marie Antoinette dans son salon'' (by Jean-Baptiste-André Gautier-Dagoty, 1777)]]

The queen spent heavily on fashion, luxuries, and gambling, though the country was facing a grave financial crisis and the population was suffering. [[Rose Bertin]] created dresses for her, and hairstyles such as ''[[pouf]]s'', up to three feet (90&amp;nbsp;cm) high, and the ''[[panache]]'' (a spray of feather plumes). She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of [[indienne]] (a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759 to protect local French woolen and silk industries), [[percale]] and [[muslin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael|last1=Batterberry|first2=Ariane|last2=Ruskin Batterberry|title=Fashion, the mirror of history|publisher=Greenwich House|location=Greenwich, Connecticut|date=1977|isbn=978-0-517-38881-5|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Flour War]] of 1775, a series of riots (due to the high price of flour and bread) had damaged her reputation among the general public. Eventually, Marie Antoinette's reputation was no better than that of the favorites of previous kings. Many French people were beginning to blame her for the degrading economic situation, suggesting the country's inability to pay off its debt was the result of her wasting the crown's money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carolly|last=Erickson|title=To the Scaffold: The Life of Marie Antoinette|publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=New York City|date=1991|isbn=978-0688073015|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her correspondence, Marie Antoinette's mother, Maria Theresa, expressed concern over her daughter's spending habits, citing the civil unrest it was beginning to cause.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Chantal. ''The Wicked Queen: The Origins of the Myth of Marie Antoinette''. Translated by Julie Rose. New York: Zone Books, 2001, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1774, Marie Antoinette had begun to befriend some of her male admirers, such as the [[Pierre Victor Besenval de Bronstatt|baron de Besenval]], the [[François-Henri de Franquetot de Coigny|duc de Coigny]], and [[House of Esterházy|Count Valentin Esterházy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=140–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arneth and Geffroy i|1874|pp=400–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also formed deep friendships with various ladies at court. Most noted was [[Marie-Louise, Princesse de Lamballe]], related to the royal family through her marriage into the [[Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre|Penthièvre family]]. On 19 September 1774 she appointed her superintendent of her household,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=131–32}}; {{harvnb|Bonnet|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; an appointment she soon transferred to her new favourite, the [[Yolande de Polastron|duchesse de Polignac]].

In 1774, she took under her patronage her former music teacher, the German opera composer [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], who remained in France until 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=111–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard Patricia, Gluck|1995|pp=105–15, 240–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood, changes at court, intervention in politics (1778–1781)===
[[File:Gautier-Dagoty - Marie-Antoinette, 1775.jpg|thumb|Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, ''en grand habit de cour'' (by Jean-Baptiste-André Gautier-Dagoty, 1775)]]

Amidst the atmosphere of a wave of ''[[libelles]]'', the Holy Roman [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] came to France incognito, using the name Comte de Falkenstein, for a six-week visit during which he toured Paris extensively and was a guest at Versailles. He met his sister and her husband on 18 April 1777 at the [[château de la Muette]], and spoke frankly to his brother-in-law, curious as to why the royal marriage had not been consummated, arriving at the conclusion that no obstacle to the couple's conjugal relations existed save the queen's lack of interest and the king's unwillingness to exert himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, Evelyne, ''Louis XVI'', Fayard, Paris, 1985, pp. 289–91&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his brother [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]], [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]], Joseph II described them as "a couple of complete blunderers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|pp=158–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disclosed to Leopold that the inexperienced—then still only 22-year-old—Louis XVI had confided in him the course of action he had been undertaking in their marital bed; saying Louis XVI "introduces the member," but then "stays there without moving for about two minutes," withdraws without having completed the act and "bids goodnight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fraser|first=Antonia|title=Marie Antoinette: The Journey|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9781400033287|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions that Louis suffered from [[phimosis]], which was relieved by [[circumcision]], have been discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=80|title=Circumcision and phimosis in eighteenth century France|website=History of Circumcision|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, following Joseph's intervention, the marriage was finally consummated in August 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight months later, in April 1778, it was suspected that the queen was pregnant, which was officially announced on 16 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=160–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Antoinette's daughter, [[Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France|Marie-Thérèse Charlotte]], ''Madame Royale'', was born at Versailles on 19 December 1778.&lt;ref name="Fraser 2001 166–170"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hibbert|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's paternity was contested in the [[libelles]], as were all her children's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the middle of the queen's pregnancy two events occurred which had a profound effect on her later life: the return of her friend and lover, the Swedish diplomat [[Axel von Fersen, Jr.|Count Axel von Fersen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12096119/Marie-Antoinettes-torrid-affair-with-Swedish-count-revealed-in-decoded-letters.html|title=Marie-Antoinette's torrid affair with Swedish count revealed in decoded letters|website=The Telegraph|last=Samuel|first=Henry|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Versailles for two years, and her brother's claim to the throne of [[Bavaria]], contested by the Habsburg monarchy and Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|pp=162–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Antoinette pleaded with her husband for the French to intercede on behalf of Austria. The [[Peace of Teschen]], signed on 13 May 1779, ended the brief conflict, with the queen imposing French mediation at her mother's insistence and Austria's gaining a territory of at least 100,000 inhabitants—a strong retreat from the early French position which was hostile towards Austria. This gave the impression, partially justified, that the queen had sided with Austria against France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=158–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arneth and Geoffroy, iii|1874|pp=168–70, 180–82, 210–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|left|''Marie Antoinette en [[chemise]]'', portrait of the queen in a "muslin" dress (by [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]], 1783).

and Intimacy in Vigée Le Brun’s Marie Antoinette en Chemise", pp. 21–28. Providence College Art Journal, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a similar portrait in formal dress did not create controversy.]]

Meanwhile, the queen began to institute changes in court customs. Some of them met with the disapproval of the older generation, such as the abandonment of heavy make-up and the popular wide-hooped [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion: The Definitive History of Costume and Style|last=Kindersley|first=Dorling|publisher=DK Publishing|year=2012|location=New York|pages=146–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new fashion called for a simpler feminine look, typified first by the rustic [[Polonaise (clothing)|''robe à la polonaise'']] style and later by the ''[[1775-95 in Western fashion#Women's fashion|gaulle]]'', a layered muslin dress Marie Antoinette wore in a 1783 [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun|Vigée-Le Brun]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|pp=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780 she began to participate in amateur plays and musicals in a theatre built for her by [[Richard Mique]] at the [[Petit Trianon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=174–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repayment of the French debt remained a difficult problem, further exacerbated by Vergennes and also by Marie Antoinette's prodding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larkin|first=T.

The primary motive for the queen's involvement in political affairs in this period may arguably have more to do with court factionalism than any true interest on her part in politics themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Antoinette-queen-of-France|title=Marie-Antoinette {{!}} Biography &amp; French Revolution|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she played an important role in aiding the [[American Revolution]] by securing Austrian and Russian support for France, which resulted in the establishment of the [[First League of Armed Neutrality]] that stopped Great Britain's attack, and by weighing indecisively for the nomination of [[Philippe Henri, marquis de Ségur]] as Minister of War and [[Charles Eugène Gabriel de La Croix]], marquis de Castries as Secretary of the Navy in 1780, who helped [[George Washington]] to defeat the British in [[the American Revolutionary War]], which ended in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=152, 171, 194–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Royal Family of France in 1781 by an anonymous artist.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|The Royal Family of France, 1781. From left to right: The [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Dukes of Berry]] and [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Angoulême]] with their sister [[Sophie d'Artois|Mademoiselle Sophie]], the [[Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy|Countess]] and [[Charles X of France|Count of Artois]], the King and Queen holding the Dauphin with his older sister [[Marie Thérèse of France|Madame Royale]] holding his train, [[Princess Élisabeth of France|Madame Élisabeth]], the [[Louis XVIII of France|Count]] and [[Marie Joséphine of Savoy|Countess of Provence]].]]

In 1783, the queen played a decisive role in the nomination of [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], a close friend of the Polignacs, as [[Controller-General of Finances]], and of the [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|baron de Breteuil]] as the [[Minister for the Maison du Roi|Minister of the Royal Household]], making him perhaps the strongest and most conservative minister of the reign.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The result of these two nominations was that Marie Antoinette's influence became paramount in government, and the new ministers rejected any major change to the structure of the old regime. More than that, the decree by de Ségur, the minister of war, requiring four [[quarters of nobility|quarterings]] of nobility as a condition for the appointment of officers, blocked the access of commoners to important positions in the armed forces, challenging the concept of equality, one of the main grievances and causes of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Fraser 2001 218–20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=218–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price Munro|Preserving the Monarchy: The Comte de Vergennes, 1774–1787|1995|pp=30–35, 145–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette's second pregnancy ended in a [[miscarriage]] early in July 1779, as confirmed by letters between the queen and her mother, although some historians believed that she may have experienced bleeding related to an irregular menstrual cycle, which she mistook for a lost pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1965&amp;context=theses Meagen Elizabeth Moreland: ''The Performance of Motherhood in the Correspondence of Madame de Sévigné, Marie-Thérèse of Austria and Joséphine Bonaparte to their Daughters''.

Her third pregnancy was affirmed in March 1781, and on 22 October she gave birth to [[Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis Joseph Xavier François]], Dauphin of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntv.co.jp/marie/works/catalog_en.pdf|title=From Vienna to Versailles: from Imperial Princess to Crown Prince}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empress Maria Theresa died on 29 November 1780 in Vienna. Marie Antoinette feared that the death of her mother would jeopardize the Franco-Austrian alliance (as well as, ultimately, herself), but her brother, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], wrote to her that he had no intention of breaking the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JD1AAQAAMAAJ |title=Marie Antoinette; Joseph II, und Leopold II |last=Arneth |first=Alfred |date=1866 |location=Leipzig / Paris / Vienna |publisher=K.F.

A second visit from Joseph II, which took place in July 1781 to reaffirm the Franco-Austrian alliance and also to see his sister, was tainted by false rumours&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fraser|first=Antonia|title=Marie Antoinette: The Journey|publisher=Phoenix|year=2006|isbn=9780753821404}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Marie Antoinette was sending money to him from the French treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=184–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|1995|pp=55–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining popularity (1782–1785)===
Despite the general celebration over the birth of the Dauphin, Marie Antoinette's political influence, such as it was, did greatly benefit Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp. 232–36&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Kettle War]], in which her brother Joseph attempted to open the [[Scheldt River]] for naval passage, Marie Antoinette succeeded in obliging Vergennes to pay huge financial compensation to Austria. Finally, the queen was able to obtain her brother's support against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the [[American Revolution]] and she neutralized French hostility to his alliance with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lettres de Marie Antoinette|Le Marquis de Beaucourt|1895|Vol ii|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=350–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, after the governess of the royal children, the [[Victoire Armande Josèphe de Rohan|princesse de Guéméné]], went bankrupt and resigned, Marie Antoinette appointed her favorite, the [[Yolande de Polastron, Duchesse de Polignac|duchesse de Polignac]], to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision met with disapproval from the court as the duchess was considered to be of too modest a birth to occupy such an exalted position. On the other hand, both the king and the queen trusted Mme de Polignac completely, gave her a thirteen-room apartment in Versailles and paid her well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=198–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Polignac family benefited greatly from royal favor in titles and positions, but its sudden wealth and lavish lifestyle outraged most aristocratic families, who resented the Polignacs' dominance at court, and also fueled the increasing popular disapproval of Marie Antoinette, mostly in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Munro Price|The Road to Versailles|2003|pp=14–15, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Mercy wrote to the Empress: "It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favor should have brought such overwhelming advantages to a family".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zweig Stephan|Marie Antoinette|1938|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1783, Marie Antoinette's new pregnancy was announced, but on the night of 1–2 November, her 28th birthday, she suffered a miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Wheeler|first1=Bonnie|title=Eleanor of Aquitaine: Lord and Lady|last2=Parsons|first2=John Carmi|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Count [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen]], after his return from America in June 1783, was accepted into the queen's private society. There were claims that the two were romantically involved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farr |first=Evelyn |title=Marie-Antoinette and Count Fersen: The Untold Love Story |date=12 Oct 2013 |publisher=Peter Owen Publishers |isbn=978-0720610017 |edition=2nd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since most of their correspondence has been lost, destroyed, or redacted, for many years there was no conclusive evidence.&lt;ref name="Fraser202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, in 2016, the ''Telegraph's'' Henry Samuel announced that researchers at France's Research Centre for the Conservation of Collections (CRCC), "using cutting-edge x-ray and different infrared scanners," had deciphered letters from her that proved the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12096119/Marie-Antoinettes-torrid-affair-with-Swedish-count-revealed-in-decoded-letters.html|title=Marie-Antoinette's torrid affair with Swedish count revealed in decoded letters|first=Henry|last=Samuel|date=12 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farr |first=Evelyn |title=I Love You Madly: Marie-Antoinette and Count Fersen: The Secret Letters |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Peter Owen Publishers |isbn=978-0720618778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, [[Libelle (literary genre)|pamphlets]] describing farcical sexual deviance including the Queen and her friends in the court were growing in popularity around the country. The ''Portefeuille d’un talon rouge'' was one of the earliest, including the Queen and a variety of other nobles in a political statement decrying the immoral practices of the court. As time went on, these came to focus more and more on the Queen. They described amorous encounters with a wide range of figures, from the Duchess de Polignac to Louis XV.  As these attacks increased, they were connected with the public's dislike of her association with the rival nation of Austria. It was publicly suggested that her supposed behavior was learned at the court of the rival nation, particularly lesbianism, which was known as the "German vice".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Lynn.

In 1783, the queen was busy with the creation of her "[[Hameau de la reine|hamlet]]", a rustic retreat built by her favored architect, [[Richard Mique]], according to the designs of the painter [[Hubert Robert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2006|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation, however, caused another uproar when its cost became widely known.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp. 206–08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gutwirth, Madelyn, The Twilight of the Goddesses: women and representation in the French revolutionary era|1992|pp=103, 178–85, 400–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hamlet was not an eccentricity of Marie Antoinette's. It was en vogue at the time for nobles to have recreations of small villages on their properties. In fact, the design was copied from that of the [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|prince de Condé]]. It was also significantly smaller and less intricate than many other nobles'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fraser|first=Antonia|title=Marie Antoinette: The Journey|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9781400033287|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time she accumulated a library of 5000 books. Those on music, often dedicated to her, were the most read, though she also liked to read history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bombelles, Marquis de|Journal, vol I|1977|pp=258–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sponsored the arts, in particular music, and also supported some scientific endeavours, encouraging and witnessing the first launch of a ''Montgolfière'', a [[hot air balloon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|1974|pp=204–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 1784, [[Pierre Beaumarchais|Beaumarchais]]'s play ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'' premiered in Paris. Initially banned by the king due to its negative portrayal of the nobility, the play was finally allowed to be publicly performed because of the queen's support and its overwhelming popularity at court, where secret readings of it had been given by Marie Antoinette. The play was a disaster for the image of the monarchy and aristocracy. It inspired [[Mozart]]'s [[The Marriage of Figaro|''Le Nozze di Figaro'']], which premiered in Vienna on 1 May 1786.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=214–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 1784, putting the baron de Breteuil in charge of its acquisition, Louis XVI bought the [[Château de Saint-Cloud]] from the [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|duc d'Orléans]] in the name of his wife, which she wanted due to their expanding family. She wanted to be able to own her own property. One that was actually hers, to then have the authority to bequeath it to "whichever of my children I wish"; choosing the child she thought could use it rather than it going through patriarchal inheritance laws or whims. It was proposed that the cost could be covered by other sales, such as that of the ''château Trompette'' in Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fraser|first=Antonia|title=Marie Antoinette: The Journey|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9781400033287|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unpopular, particularly with those factions of the nobility who disliked the queen, but also with a growing percentage of the population, who disapproved of a Queen of France independently owning a private residence. The purchase of Saint-Cloud thus damaged the public's image of the queen even further. The château's high price, almost 6&amp;nbsp;million [[livres]], plus the substantial extra cost of redecorating, ensured that much less money was going towards repaying France's substantial debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=216–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=358–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 1785, Marie Antoinette gave birth to a second son, [[Louis XVII of France|Louis Charles]], who bore the title of [[duc de Normandie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=224–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the birth occurred exactly nine months after Fersen's return did not escape the attention of many, leading to doubt as to the parentage of the child and to a noticeable decline of the queen's reputation in public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2006|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Marie Antoinette's and Louis XVII's biographers believe that the young prince was the biological son of Louis XVI, including [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Antonia Fraser]], who believe that Fersen and Marie Antoinette were indeed romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Zweig, ''Marie Antoinette: The portrait of an average woman'', New York, 1933, pp. 143, 244–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=267–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Dunlop (author)|Ian Dunlop]], ''Marie-Antoinette: A Portrait'', London, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Évelyne Lever, ''Marie-Antoinette : la dernière reine'', Fayard, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simone Bertière, ''Marie-Antoinette: l'insoumise'', Le Livre de Poche, Paris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Beckman, ''How to ruin a Queen: Marie Antoinette, the Stolen Diamonds and the Scandal that shook the French throne'', London, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Munro Price, ''The Fall of the French Monarchy: Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and the baron de Breteuil'', London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cadbury, ''The Lost King of France: The tragic story of Marie-Antoinette's Favourite Son'', London, 2003, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser has also noted that the birthdate matches up perfectly with a known conjugal visit from the King.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Courtiers at Versailles noted in their diaries that the date of the child's conception in fact corresponded perfectly with a period when the king and the queen had spent much time together, but these details were ignored amid attacks on the queen's character.&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; These suspicions of illegitimacy, along with the continued publication of the ''libelles'' and never-ending cavalcades of court intrigues, the actions of Joseph II in the [[Kettle War]], the purchase of Saint-Cloud, and the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]] combined to turn popular opinion sharply against the queen, and the image of a licentious, spendthrift, empty-headed foreign queen was quickly taking root in the French psyche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second daughter, her last child, [[Princess Sophie Hélène Béatrice of France|Marie Sophie Hélène Béatrix]], ''Madame Sophie'', was born on 9 July 1786 and lived only eleven months until 19 June 1787.

Marie Antoinette's four live-born children were:
* [[Marie Thérèse of France|Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte]], ''Madame Royale'' (19 December 1778 – 19 October 1851)
* [[Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France|Louis-Joseph-Xavier-François]], ''Dauphin'' (22 October 1781 – 4 June 1789)
* [[Louis XVII of France|Louis-Charles]], ''Dauphin'' after the death of his elder brother, future titular king Louis XVII of France (27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795)
* [[Princess Sophie Hélène Béatrice of France|Sophie-Hélène-Béatrix]], died in infancy (9 July 1786 – 19 June 1787)

===Prelude to the Revolution: scandals and the failure of reforms (1786–1789)===

====Diamond necklace scandal====
{{Main|Affair of the Diamond Necklace}}
[[File:Collier reine Breteuil.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Copy of the diamond necklace, ''Le Collier de la Reine'', at [[Château de Breteuil]]]]

Marie Antoinette began to abandon her more carefree activities to become increasingly involved in politics in her role as Queen of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=248–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; By publicly showing her attention to the education and care of her children, the queen sought to improve the dissolute image she had acquired in 1785 from the "[[Affair of the Diamond Necklace|Diamond Necklace Affair]]", in which public opinion had falsely accused her of criminal participation in defrauding the jewelers Boehmer and Bassenge of the price of an expensive diamond necklace they had originally created for Madame du Barry. The main actors in the scandal were [[Cardinal de Rohan]], prince de Rohan-Guéméné, Great Almoner of France, and [[Jeanne of Valois-Saint-Rémy|Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, Comtesse de La Motte]], a descendant of an illegitimate child of [[Henry II of France]] of the [[House of Valois]]. Marie Antoinette had profoundly disliked Rohan since the time he had been the French ambassador to Vienna when she was a child. Despite his high clerical position at the Court, she never addressed a word to him. Others involved were Nicole Lequay, alias ''Baronne d'Oliva'', a prostitute who happened to look like Marie Antoinette; [[Rétaux de Villette]], a forger; [[Alessandro Cagliostro]], an Italian adventurer; and the Comte de La Motte, Jeanne de Valois' husband. Mme de La Motte tricked Rohan into buying the necklace as a gift to Marie Antoinette, for him to gain the queen's favor.

When the affair was discovered, those involved (except de La Motte and Rétaux de Villette, who both managed to flee) were arrested, tried, convicted, and either imprisoned or exiled. Mme de La Motte was sentenced for life to confinement in the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital]], which also served as a prison for women. Judged by the Parlement, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing and allowed to leave the Bastille. Marie Antoinette, who had insisted on the arrest of the Cardinal, was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, and despite the fact that the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Failure of political and financial reforms====
Suffering from an acute case of depression, the king began to seek the advice of his wife. In her new role and with increasing political power, the queen tried to improve the awkward situation brewing between the assembly and the king.&lt;ref name="Fraser248-250"/&gt; This change of the queen's position signaled the end of the Polignacs' influence and their impact on the finances of the Crown.

[[File:Marie Antoinette by Sicard.jpg|thumb|Miniature of Marie Antoinette (by Louis Marie Sicard, 1787)]]

Continuing deterioration of the financial situation despite cutbacks to the royal retinue and court expenses ultimately forced the king, the queen and the Minister of Finance, [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]], at the urging of Vergennes, to call a session of the [[Assembly of Notables]], after a hiatus of 160 years. The assembly was held for the purpose of initiating necessary financial reforms, but the [[Parlement]] refused to cooperate. The first meeting took place on 22 February 1787, nine days after the death of Vergennes on 13 February. Marie Antoinette did not attend the meeting and her absence resulted in accusations that the queen was trying to undermine its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=246–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=419–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly was a failure. It did not pass any reforms and, instead, fell into a pattern of defying the king. On the urging of the queen, Louis XVI dismissed Calonne on 8 April 1787.&lt;ref name="Fraser248-250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=248–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1787, [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne]], [[archbishop of Toulouse]] and one of the queen's political allies, was appointed by the king at her urging to replace Calonne, first as [[Controller-General of Finances]] and then as Prime Minister. He began to institute more cutbacks at court while trying to restore the royal absolute power weakened by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=250–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brienne was unable to improve the financial situation, and since he was the queen's ally, this failure adversely affected her political position. The continued poor financial climate of the country resulted in the 25 May dissolution of the Assembly of Notables because of its inability to function, and the lack of solutions was blamed on the queen.&lt;ref name="Fraser 2001 218–20"/&gt;

France's financial problems were the result of a combination of factors: several expensive wars; a large royal family whose expenditures were paid for by the state; and an unwillingness on the part of most members of the privileged classes, aristocracy, and clergy, to help defray the costs of the government out of their own pockets by relinquishing some of their financial privileges. As a result of the public perception that she had single-handedly ruined the national finances, Marie Antoinette was given the nickname of "Madame Déficit" in the summer of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the sole fault for the financial crisis did not lie with her, Marie Antoinette was the biggest obstacle to any major reform effort. She had played a decisive role in the disgrace of the reformer ministers of finance, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] (in 1776), and [[Jacques Necker]] (first dismissal in 1781). If the secret expenses of the queen were taken into account, court expenses were much higher than the official estimate of 7% of the state budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=254–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Antoinette and her Children by Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|This State Portrait of Marie Antoinette and her three surviving children, Marie Thérèse, Louis Charles (on her lap), and Louis Joseph holding up the drape of an empty bassinet signifying the recent death of Marie's fourth child, Sophie, was meant to improve her reputation by depicting her as a mother in simple, yet stately attire (by [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Vigée-Lebrun]], 1787).]]

The queen attempted to fight back with propaganda portraying her as a caring mother, most notably in the painting by [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] exhibited at the [[Paris Salon|'' Royal Académie Salon de Paris'']] in August 1787, showing her with her children.&lt;ref&gt;Facos, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy escaped from prison and fled to London, where she published damaging slander concerning her supposed amorous affair with the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=255–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political situation in 1787 worsened when, at Marie Antoinette's urging, the ''[[Parlement]]'' was exiled to [[Troyes]] on 15 August. It further deteriorated when Louis XVI tried to use a ''[[lit de justice]]'' on 11 November to impose legislation. The [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|new Duc d'Orléans]] publicly protested the king's actions, and was subsequently exiled to his estate at [[Villers-Cotterêts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=257–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The May Edicts issued on 8 May 1788 were also opposed by the public and parliament. Finally, on 8 August, Louis XVI announced his intention to bring back the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]], the traditional elected legislature of the country, which had not been convened since 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=258–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While from late 1787 up to his death in June 1789, Marie Antoinette's primary concern was the continued deterioration of the health of the Dauphin, who suffered from [[tuberculosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=260–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was directly involved in the exile of the ''Parlement'', the May Edicts, and the announcement regarding the Estates-General. She did participate in the King Council, the first queen to do this in over 175 years (since [[Marie de' Medici]] had been named ''Chef du Conseil du Roi'', between 1614 and 1617), and she was making the major decisions behind the scene and in the Royal Council.

Marie Antoinette was instrumental in the reinstatement of [[Jacques Necker]] as Finance Minister on 26 August, a popular move, even though she herself was worried that it would go against her if Necker proved unsuccessful in reforming the country's finances. She accepted Necker's proposition to double the representation of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] (tiers état) in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=263–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|2001|pp=448–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the opening of the Estates-General, the queen attended the mass celebrating its return. As soon as it opened on 5 May 1789, the fracture between the democratic [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] (consisting of bourgeois and radical aristocrats) and the conservative nobility of the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]] widened, and Marie Antoinette knew that her rival, the Duc d'Orléans, who had given money and bread to the people during the winter, would be acclaimed by the crowd, much to her detriment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|A diary of the French Revolution 1789–93|Morris Gouverneur|1939|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of the Dauphin on 4 June, which deeply affected his parents, was virtually ignored by the French people,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolardot, Louis, ''Journal de Louis Seize'', 1873, pp. 133–38&lt;/ref&gt; who were instead preparing for the next meeting of the Estates-General and hoping for a resolution to the bread crisis. As the Third Estate declared itself a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and took the [[Tennis Court Oath]], and as people either spread or believed rumors that the queen wished to bathe in their blood, Marie Antoinette went into mourning for her eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=274–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her role was decisive in urging the king to remain firm and not concede to popular demands for reforms. In addition, she showed her determination to use force to crush the forthcoming revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=279–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=462–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution before Varennes (1789–1791)==
[[File:Anonymous - Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|[[Storming of the Bastille]] and arrest of Governor [[Bernard-René de Launay]], 14 July 1789]]

The situation escalated on 20 June as the Third Estate, which had been joined by several members of the clergy and radical nobility, found the door to its appointed meeting place closed by order of the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Doyle|first=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution. Oxford University Press|year=1990|pages=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus met at the tennis court in Versailles and took the [[Tennis Court Oath]] not to separate before it had given a constitution to the nation.

On 11 July at Marie Antoinette's urging Necker was dismissed and replaced by Breteuil, the queen's choice to crush the Revolution with mercenary Swiss troops under the command of one of her favorites, [[Pierre Victor, baron de Besenval de Brünstatt]].&lt;ref&gt;i{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=280–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Letters vol 2|pp=130–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1939|pp=130–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the news, Paris was besieged by riots that culminated in the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=282–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=474–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 July [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] was named commander-in-chief of the newly formed [[National Guard (France)|''Garde nationale'']].&lt;ref name="Fraser 2001 284–289"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=284–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Despaches of Earl Grower|Oscar Browning|Cambridge 1885|pp=70–75, 245–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the storming of the Bastille, for fear of assassination, and ordered by the king, the emigration of members of the high aristocracy began on 17 July with the departure of the [[Charles X of France|comte d'Artois]], the Condés, cousins of the king,&lt;ref&gt;''Journal d'émigration du prince de Condé. 1789–1795'', publié par le comte de Ribes, Bibliothèque nationale de France. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6530679p/f28.image]&lt;/ref&gt; and the unpopular Polignacs. Marie Antoinette, whose life was as much in danger, remained with the king, whose power was gradually being taken away by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]].&lt;ref name="Fraser 2001 284–289"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castelot, ''Charles X'', Librairie Académique Perrin, Paris, 1988, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Despaches of Earl Grower|Oscar Browning|Cambridge, 1885|pp=70–75, 245–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudal privileges]] by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] on 4 August 1789 and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (''La Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen''), drafted by Lafayette with the help of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and adopted on 26 August, paved the way to a [[Kingdom of France (1791–92)|Constitutional Monarchy]] (4 September 1791 – 21 September 1792).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=484–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these dramatic changes, life at the court continued, while the situation in Paris was becoming critical because of bread shortages in September. On 5 October, a [[The Women's March on Versailles|crowd from Paris descended upon Versailles]] and forced the royal family to move to the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris, where they lived under a form of house arrest under the watch of Lafayette's ''Garde Nationale'', while the Comte de Provence and [[Marie Joséphine of Savoy|his wife]] were allowed to reside in the [[Petit Luxembourg]], where they remained until they went into exile on 20 June 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/evenement/archives/presidence1.html|title=dossiers d'histoire – Le Palais du Luxembourg – Sénat|website=senat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette continued to perform charitable functions and attend religious ceremonies, but dedicated most of her time to her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=304–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also played an important political, albeit not public, role between 1789 and 1791 when she had a complex set of relationships with several key actors of the early period of the French Revolution. One of the most important was Necker, the Prime Minister of Finances (''Premier ministre des finances'').&lt;ref&gt;''Discours prononcé par M. Necker, Premier Ministre des Finances, à l'Assemblée Nationale, le 24. Septembre 1789''.[https://books.google.fr/books?id=OSh8riUvV_UC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=necker+premier+ministre+des+finances&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j1FO3K8sSy&amp;sig=deQBeYTngT_4IybHN8BCis-xEIA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwA2oVChMI8JShrtiSxwIVxVUUCh1I_wCi#v=onepage&amp;q=necker%20premier%20ministre%20des%20finances&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her dislike of him, she played a decisive role in his return to the office.  She blamed him for his support of the Revolution and did not regret his resignation in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=536–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafayette, one of the former [[Military leadership in the American Revolutionary War|military leaders in the American War of Independence]] (1775–83), served as the warden of the royal family in his position as commander-in-chief of the ''Garde Nationale''. Despite his dislike of the queen—he detested her as much as she detested him and at one time had even threatened to send her to a convent—he was persuaded by the mayor of Paris, [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], to work and collaborate with her, and allowed her to see Fersen a number of times. He even went as far as exiling the Duke of Orléans, who was accused by the queen of fomenting trouble. His relationship with the king was more cordial. As a liberal aristocrat, he did not want the fall of the monarchy but rather the establishment of a liberal one, similar to that of the [[History of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], based on cooperation between the king and the people, as was to be defined in the Constitution of 1791.

Despite her attempts to remain out of the public eye, Marie Antoinette was falsely accused in the ''libelles'' of having an affair with Lafayette, whom she loathed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as was published in ''Le Godmiché Royal'' ("The Royal Dildo"), and of having a sexual relationship with the English baroness Lady Sophie Farrell of Bournemouth, a well-known lesbian of the time. Publication of such calumnies continued to the end, climaxing at her trial with an accusation of incest with her son. There is no evidence to support the accusations.

===Mirabeau===
[[File:Alexander Kucharski, La Reine Marie-Antoinette (années 1790).jpg|thumb|Marie Antoinette at the Tuileries Palace in 1790 (Pastel by [[Alexandre Kucharski]])]]

A significant achievement of Marie Antoinette in that period was the establishment of an alliance with [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau]], the most important lawmaker in the assembly. Like Lafayette, Mirabeau was a liberal aristocrat. He had joined the [[Third estate]] and was not against the monarchy, but wanted to reconcile it with the Revolution. He also wanted to be a minister and was not immune to corruption. On the advice of Mercy, Marie Antoinette opened secret negotiations with him and both agreed to meet privately at the [[château de Saint-Cloud]] on 3 July 1790, where the royal family was allowed to spend the summer, free of the radical elements who watched their every move in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=528–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Mirabeau was much impressed by the queen, and remarked in a letter to [[Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg]], [[Comte de la Marck]], that she was the only person the king had by him: ''La Reine est le seul homme que le Roi ait auprès de Lui.''&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires de Mirabeau'', tome VII, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached turning Mirabeau into one of her political allies: Marie Antoinette promised to pay him 6000 livres per month and one million if he succeeded in his mission to restore the king's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=524–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only time the royal couple returned to Paris in that period was on 14 July to attend the ''[[Fête de la Fédération]]'', an official ceremony held at the [[Champ de Mars]] in commemoration of the fall of the Bastille one year earlier. At least 300,000 persons participated from all over France, including 18,000 national guards, with [[Talleyrand]], bishop of [[Autun]], celebrating a mass at the ''autel de la Patrie'' ("altar of the fatherland"). The king was greeted at the event with loud cheers of "Long live the king!", especially when he took the oath to protect the nation and to enforce the laws voted by the Constitutional Assembly. There were even cheers for the queen, particularly when she presented the Dauphin to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|2001|Fraser|pp=314–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirabeau sincerely wanted to reconcile the queen with the people, and she was happy to see him restoring much of the king's powers, such as his authority over foreign policy, and the right to declare war. Over the objections of Lafayette and his allies, the king was given a suspensive veto allowing him to veto any laws for a period of four years. With time, Mirabeau would support the queen, even more, going as far as to suggest that Louis XVI "adjourn" to Rouen or Compiègne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leverage with the Assembly ended with the death of Mirabeau in April 1791, despite the attempt of several moderate leaders of the Revolution to contact the queen to establish some basis of cooperation with her.

===Civil Constitution of the Clergy===
In March 1791 [[Pope Pius VI]] had condemned the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], reluctantly signed by Louis XVI, which reduced the number of bishops from 132 to 93, imposed the election of bishops and all members of the clergy by departmental or district assemblies of electors, and reduced the Pope's authority over the Church. Religion played an important role in the life of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, both raised in the Roman Catholic faith. The queen's political ideas and her belief in the absolute power of monarchs were based on France's long-established tradition of the [[divine right of kings]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} On 18 April, as the royal family prepared to leave for Saint-Cloud to attend Easter mass celebrated by a refractory priest, a crowd, soon joined by the ''Garde Nationale'' (disobeying Lafayette's orders), prevented their departure from Paris, prompting Marie Antoinette to declare to Lafayette that she and her family were no longer free. This incident fortified her in her determination to leave Paris for personal and political reasons, not alone, but with her family. Even the king, who had been hesitant, accepted his wife's decision to flee with the help of foreign powers and counter-revolutionary forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=321–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=542–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=336–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fersen and Breteuil, who represented her in the courts of Europe, were put in charge of the escape plan, while Marie Antoinette continued her negotiations with some of the moderate leaders of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=321–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=340–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight, arrest at Varennes and return to Paris (21–25 June 1791)==
{{Main|Flight to Varennes}}
[[File:Arrest of Louis XVI and his Family, Varennes, 1791.jpg|thumb|left|Arrest of the royal family at the house of the registrar of passports at Varennes night of 21–22 June 1791 (by Thomas Falcon Marshall, 1854)]]

There had been several plots designed to help the royal family escape, which the queen had rejected because she would not leave without the king, or which had ceased to be viable because of the king's indecision. Once Louis XVI finally did commit to a plan, its poor execution was the cause of its failure. In an elaborate attempt known as the [[Flight to Varennes]] to reach the [[Monarchism|royalist]] stronghold of [[Montmédy]], some members of the royal family were to pose as the servants of an imaginary "Mme de Korff", a wealthy Russian baroness, a role played by [[Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ de Tourzel]], governess of the royal children.

After many delays, the escape was ultimately attempted on 21 June 1791, but the entire family was arrested less than twenty-four hours later at [[Varennes-en-Argonne|Varennes]] and taken back to Paris within a week. The escape attempt destroyed much of the remaining support of the population for the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=325–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=555–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retour Varennes 1791.jpg|thumb|Return of the royal family to Paris on 25 June 1791, after the flight to Varennes (colored engraving, Carnavalet Museum, Paris)]]

Upon learning of the capture of the royal family, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] sent three representatives, [[Antoine Barnave]], [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve]] and [[Charles César de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg]] to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris. On the way to the capital they were jeered and insulted by the people as never before. The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level. During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from the crowds, and even Pétion took pity on the royal family. Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence by the crowd. Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly [[Exoneration|exonerated]] of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=569–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=385–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette's first Lady of the Bedchamber, [[Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan|Mme Campan]], wrote about what happened to the queen's hair on the night of 21–22 June, "...in a single night, it had turned white as that of a seventy-year old woman." (''En une seule nuit ils étaient devenus blancs comme ceux d'une femme de soixante-dix ans.'')&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires de Madame Campan, première femme de chambre de Marie-Antoinette'', Le Temps retrouvé, Mercure de France, Paris, 1988, p. 272, {{ISBN|2-7152-1566-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radicalization of the Revolution after Varennes (1791–92)==
[[File:Kucharski's Marie Antoinette.jpg|thumb|Marie-Antoinette, c. 1792. A blow from a pike struck by a revolutionary is visible on the lower part of the work (unfinished pastel portrait by Alexandre Kucharski).]]

After their return from Varennes and until the [[10 August (French Revolution)|storming of the Tuileries]] on 10 August 1792, the queen, her family and entourage were held under tight surveillance by the ''Garde Nationale'' in the Tuileries, where the royal couple was guarded night and day. Four guards accompanied the queen wherever she went, and her bedroom door had to be left open at night. Her health also began to deteriorate, thus further reducing her physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lettres de Marie Antoinette vol 2|1895|pp=364–78|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=576–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 1791, with the support of Barnave and his friends, Lafayette's ''Garde Nationale'' [[Champ de Mars Massacre|opened fire]] on the crowd that had assembled on the Champ de Mars to sign a petition demanding the [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of the king. The estimated number of those killed varies between 12 and 50. Lafayette's reputation never recovered from the event and, on 8 October, he resigned as commander of the ''Garde Nationale''. Their enmity continuing, Marie Antoinette played a decisive role in defeating him in his aims to become the mayor of Paris in November 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=350, 360–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francois Dumont Miniatur Marie Antoinette 1792.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Portrait miniature|Miniature]] of Marie Antoinette (by [[François Dumont (painter)|François Dumont]], 1792)]]

As her correspondence shows, while Barnave was taking great political risks in the belief that the queen was his political ally and had managed, despite her unpopularity, to secure a moderate majority ready to work with her, Marie Antoinette was not considered sincere in her cooperation with the moderate leaders of the French Revolution, which ultimately ended any chance to establish a moderate government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=353–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the view that the unpopular queen was controlling the king further degraded the royal couple's standing with the people, which the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] successfully exploited after their return from Varennes to advance their radical agenda to abolish the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=350–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation lasted until the spring of 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=357–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=408–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette continued to hope that the military coalition of European kingdoms would succeed in crushing the Revolution. She counted most on the support of her Austrian family. After the death of her brother Joseph in 1790, his successor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Marie Antoinette as queen of France|url=https://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/marie-antoinette-queen-france|access-date=2020-12-15|website=Die Welt der Habsburger|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was willing to support her to a limited degree.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Upon Leopold's death in 1792, his son, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]], a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal couple more vigorously because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas for the monarchies of Europe, particularly, for Austria's influence in the continent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Barnave had advised the queen to call back Mercy, who had played such an important role in her life before the Revolution, but Mercy had been appointed to another foreign diplomatic position {{Where?|date=August 2016}} and could not return to France. At the end of 1791, ignoring the danger she faced, the ''Princesse de Lamballe'', who was in London, returned to the Tuileries. As for Fersen, despite the strong restrictions imposed on the queen, he was able to see her a final time in February 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=599–601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events leading to the abolition of the monarchy on 10 August 1792==
Leopold's and Francis II's strong action on behalf of Marie Antoinette led to France's declaration of war on Austria on 20 April 1792. This resulted in the queen being viewed as an enemy, although she was personally against Austrian claims to French territories on European soil. That summer, the situation was compounded by multiple defeats of the French armies by the Austrians, in part because Marie Antoinette passed on military secrets to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|2001|pp=365–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at the insistence of his wife, Louis XVI vetoed several measures that would have further restricted his power, earning the royal couple the nicknames "Monsieur Veto" and "Madame Veto",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=365–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=607–09}}&lt;/ref&gt; nicknames then prominently featured in different contexts, including [[Carmagnole|La Carmagnole]].

[[File:Madame Veto.jpg|thumb|left|Plate with the beginning of the text of the song [[La Carmagnole]]: ''Madame Veto…'']]

Barnave remained the most important advisor and supporter of the queen, who was willing to work with him as long as he met her demands, which he did to a large extent. Barnave and the moderates comprised about 260 lawmakers in the new Legislative Assembly; the radicals numbered around 136, and the rest around 350. Initially, the majority was with Barnave, but the queen's policies led to the radicalization of the Assembly and the moderates lost control of the legislative process. The moderate government collapsed in April 1792 to be replaced by a radical majority headed by the ''[[Girondist|Girondins]]''. The Assembly then passed a series of laws concerning the Church, the aristocracy, and the formation of new national guard units; all were vetoed by Louis XVI. While Barnave's faction had dropped to 120 members, the new ''Girondin'' majority controlled the legislative assembly with 330 members. The two strongest members of that government were [[Jean Marie Roland]], who was minister of interior, and General [[Dumouriez]], the minister of foreign affairs. Dumouriez sympathized with the royal couple and wanted to save them but he was rebuffed by the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot|1962|pp=415–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever, Marie Antoinette|1991|pp=591–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette's actions in refusing to collaborate with the ''Girondins'', in power between April and June 1792, led them to denounce the treason of the Austrian comity, a direct allusion to the queen. After [[Madame Roland]] sent a letter to the king denouncing the queen's role in these matters, urged by the queen, Louis XVI disbanded {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} the government, thus losing his majority in the Assembly. Dumouriez resigned and refused a post in any new government. At this point, the tide against royal authority intensified in the population and political parties, while Marie Antoinette encouraged the king to veto the new laws voted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot|1962|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1791, the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] threatened an invasion of France. This led in turn to a French declaration of war in April 1792, which led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and to the events of August 1792, which ended the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=371–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Tuilleries, 20th June 1792.jpg|thumb|Marie Antoinette with her children and Madame Élisabeth, facing the mob that had broken into the [[Tuileries Palace]] on 20 June 1792, ([[Musée de la Révolution française]])]]

On 20 June 1792, "a mob of terrifying aspect" broke into the Tuileries, made the king wear the ''[[Phrygian cap|bonnet rouge]]'' (red Phrygian cap) to show his loyalty to the Republic, insulted Marie Antoinette, accusing her of betraying France, and threatened her life. In consequence, the queen asked Fersen to urge the foreign powers to carry out their plans to invade France and to issue a manifesto in which they threatened to destroy Paris if anything happened to the royal family. The [[Brunswick Manifesto]], issued on 25 July 1792, triggered the events of 10 August&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=368, 375–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the approach of an armed mob on its way to the Tuileries Palace forced the royal family to seek refuge at the Legislative Assembly. Ninety minutes later, the palace was invaded by the mob, who massacred the [[Swiss Guards#Swiss Guards (Gardes Suisses)|Swiss Guard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=373–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=428–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]] in the [[Le Marais|Marais]] under conditions considerably harsher than those of their previous confinement in the Tuileries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=382–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, several of the royal family's attendants, among them the ''Princesse de Lamballe'', were taken for interrogation by the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]]. Transferred to the [[La Force Prison|'' La Force'' prison]], after a rapid judgment, [[Marie Thérèse Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe|Marie Louise de Lamballe]] was [[September Massacres|savagely killed]] on 3 September. Her head was affixed on a pike and paraded through the city to the Temple for the queen to see. Marie Antoinette was prevented from seeing it, but fainted upon learning of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=442–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1792, the fall of the monarchy was officially declared and the [[National Convention]] became the governing body of the French Republic. The royal family name was downgraded to the non-royal "[[House of Capet|Capets]]". Preparations began for the trial of the king in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis XVI's trial and execution===
Charged with treason against the [[French First Republic]], Louis XVI was separated from his family and [[Trial of Louis XVI|tried]] in December. He was found guilty by the Convention, led by the Jacobins who rejected the idea of keeping him as a hostage. On 15 January 1793, by a majority of six votes, he was condemned to death by guillotine and executed on 21 January 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=395–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=447–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marie Antoinette in the Temple==
[[File:Marie Antoinette at the Temple Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marie Antoinette prisoner in the Temple Tower (attributed to Alexandre Kucharski, c. 1792)]]

The queen, now called "Widow Capet", plunged into deep mourning. She still hoped her son [[Louis XVII of France|Louis-Charles]], whom the exiled [[Louis XVIII of France|'' Comte de Provence'']], Louis XVI's brother, had recognized as Louis XVI's successor, would one day rule France. The royalists and the [[refractory clergy]], including those preparing the insurrection in [[Vendée]], supported Marie Antoinette and the return to the monarchy. Throughout her imprisonment and up to her execution, Marie Antoinette could count on the sympathy of conservative factions and social-religious groups which had turned against the Revolution, and also on wealthy individuals ready to bribe republican officials to facilitate her escape;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=453–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plots all failed. While imprisoned in the Tower of the Temple, Marie Antoinette, her children, and Élisabeth were insulted, some of the guards going as far as blowing smoke in the ex-queen's face. Strict security measures were taken to assure that Marie Antoinette was not able to communicate with the outside world. Despite these measures, several of her guards were open to bribery and a line of communication was kept with the outside world.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

After Louis' execution, Marie Antoinette's fate became a central question of the National Convention. While some advocated her death, others proposed exchanging her for French prisoners of war or for a ransom from the Holy Roman Emperor. [[Thomas Paine]] advocated exile to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=398, 408}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1793, during the [[Reign of Terror]], a [[Committee of Public Safety]] dominated by [[Robespierre]] was formed, and men such as [[Jacques Hébert]] began to call for Marie-Antoinette's trial. By the end of May, the ''Girondins'' had been chased from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=411–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls were also made to "retrain" the eight-year-old Louis XVII, to make him pliant to revolutionary ideas. To carry this out, Louis Charles was separated from his mother on 3 July after a struggle during which his mother fought in vain to retain her son, who was handed over to [[Antoine Simon]], a cobbler and representative of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]]. Until her removal from the Temple, Marie Antoinette spent hours trying to catch a glimpse of her son, who, within weeks, had been made to turn against her, accusing his mother of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=412–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marie Antoinette's Cell at Conciergerie.jpg|thumb|Marie Antoinette's cell in the ''Conciergerie'' where she was allowed no privacy.]]

===Conciergerie===
On the night of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was transferred from the Temple to an isolated cell in the [[Conciergerie]] as 'Prisoner n° 280'. Leaving the tower she bumped her head against the [[lintel]] of a door, which prompted one of her guards to ask her if she was hurt, to which she answered, "No! Nothing now can hurt me."&lt;ref&gt;Funck-Brentano, Frantz: ''Les Derniers jours de Marie-Antoinette'', Flammarion, Paris, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; This was the most difficult period of her captivity. She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy. The "Carnation Plot" (''Le complot de l'œillet''), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Furneaux|19711|pp=139–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was attended by [[Rosalie Lamorlière]], who took care of her as much as she could. At least once she received a visit by a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lenotre: ''The Last Days of Marie Antoinette'', 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=416–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and execution (14–16 October 1793)==
[[File:Marie-Antoinette au Tribunal révolutionnaire by Alphonse François.jpg|left|thumb|''Marie Antoinette au Tribunal révolutionnaire'' (engraving by [[Alphonse François]], from a painting by [[Paul Delaroche]], (1857)]]

Marie Antoinette was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 14 October 1793. Some historians believe the outcome of the trial had been decided in advance by the Committee of Public Safety around the time the Carnation Plot &lt;small&gt;([[:fr:Complot de l'œillet|fr]])&lt;/small&gt; was uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot, Marie Antoinette|1962|pp=496–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her lawyers were given less than one day to prepare her defense. Among the accusations, many previously published in the ''libelles'', were: orchestrating orgies in Versailles, sending millions of livres of treasury money to Austria, planning the massacre of the ''gardes françaises'' (National Guards) in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;''Procès de Louis XVI, de Marie-Antoinette, de Marie-Elisabeth et de Philippe d'Orléans'', Recueil de pièces authentiques, Années 1792, 1793 et 1794, De Mat, imprimeur-libraire, Bruxelles, 1821, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; declaring her son to be the new king of France, and [[incest]], a charge made by her son Louis Charles, pressured into doing so by the radical [[Jacques Hébert]] who controlled him. This last accusation drew an emotional response from Marie Antoinette, who refused to respond to this charge, instead appealing to all mothers present in the room. Their reaction comforted her since these women were not otherwise sympathetic to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot|1957|pp=380–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=429–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, and [[high treason]] because of her intelligence activities in the interest of the enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Le procès de Marie-Antoinette'', Ministère de la Justice, 17 October 2011, (French) [http://www.justice.gouv.fr/histoire-et-patrimoine-10050/proces-historiques-10411/le-proces-de-marie-antoinette-22697.html]&lt;/ref&gt; At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Furneaus|1971|pp=150–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://teaattrianon.blogspot.com/2007/05/last-letter-of-marie-antoinette.html|title=Last Letter of Marie-Antoinette |date=26 May 2007|work=Tea at Trianon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her will was part of the collection of papers of [[Robespierre]] found under his bed and were published by [[Edme-Bonaventure Courtois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zwx_FBzaUxEC&amp;q=Courtois&amp;pg=PA101|title=Papiers inédits trouvés chez Robespierre, Saint-Just, Payan, etc. supprimés ou omis par Courtois...|first1=Edme-Bonaventure|last1=Courtois|first2=Maximilien de|last2=Robespierre|date=31 January 2019|publisher=Baudoin|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Documents intéressant E.B.

Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She wanted to wear a black dress but was forced to wear a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (''carrosse''), she had to sit in an open cart (''charrette'') for the hour it took to convey her from the ''Conciergerie'' via the [[rue Saint-Honoré]] thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution (the present-day [[Place de la Concorde]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Furneaus|1971|pp=155–56|}}&lt;/ref&gt; She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|constitutional]] priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold as he had pledged his allegiance to the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castelot|1957|pp=550–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|Marie Antoinette|1991|p=660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign response===
After her execution, Marie Antoinette became a symbol abroad as a consequence and controversial figure of the French Revolution. Some used her as a scapegoat to blame for the events of the Revolution. Thomas Jefferson, writing in 1821, claimed that "Her inordinate gambling and dissipations, with those of the Count d’Artois, and others of her clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, which called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible perverseness, and dauntless spirit, led herself to the Guillotine" adding that "I have ever believed that, had there been no Queen, there would have been no revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bartleby.com/400/prose/471.html |title=Passages from his autobiography |date=1854 |language=en |publisher=[[bartleby]] |access-date=17 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were shocked and viewed it as evidence of the dangers of Revolution. Edmund Burke gave a speech lamenting her death stating that "the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever" and now "Never, never more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/edmund-burke-execution-of-marie-antoinette-1793/#:~:text=Edmund%20Burke%2C%20the%20Anglo%2DIrish,then%20the%20dauphiness%2C%20at%20Versailles |title=EDMUND BURKE LAMENTS THE EXECUTION OF MARIE-ANTOINETTE (1793) |date=1793 |language=en |publisher=[[Alpha History]] |access-date=17 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving the news, [[Maria Carolina]], Queen of Naples and close sister to Marie Antoinette, spiraled into a state of mourning and an anger against the revolutionaries. She quickly suspended protections of reformers and intellectuals in Naples, allowed Neapolitan bishops wide latitude to halt the secularization of the country, and offered succor to the overflowing number of émigrés fleeing from revolutionary France, many of whom were granted pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/maria-carolina-1752-1814#:~:text=On%20October%2015%2C%201767%2C%20the,journey%20to%20Italy%2C%20Josepha%20died.&amp;text=Maria%20Carolina%20cried%20and%20entreated,Neapolitan%20match%20must%20be%20cursed |title=Maria Carolina (1752–1814) |date= 2019 |language=en |publisher=[[Cengage]] |access-date=17 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bourbon Restoration===
Both Marie Antoinette's and Louis XVI's bodies were exhumed on 18 January 1815, during the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration]], when the ''Comte de Provence'' ascended the newly reestablished throne as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], King of France and of Navarre. Christian burial of the royal remains took place three days later, on 21 January, in the necropolis of French kings at the [[Basilica of St Denis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=411, 447}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Grab Louis XVI und Marie Antoinette.JPG|thumb|Funerary monument to King [[Louis XVI]] and Queen Marie Antoinette in the [[Basilica of St Denis]] (sculptures by [[Edme Gaulle]] and [[Pierre Petitot]], (1830))]]{{clear left}}

==Legacy==
For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was the symbol of what was wrong with the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the financial difficulties of the nation was placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lynn|last=Hunt|chapter=The Many Bodies of Marie Antoinette: Political Pornography and the Problem of the Feminine in the French Revolution|title=The French Revolution: Recent Debates and New Controversies|edition=2nd|editor-first=Gary|editor-last=Kates|pages=[https://archive.org/details/frenchrevolution00kate/page/201 201–18]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=1998|isbn=978-0415358330|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/frenchrevolution00kate/page/201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the new republican ideas of what it meant to be a member of a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas|last=Kaiser|title=From the Austrian Committee to the Foreign Plot: Marie-Antoinette, Austrophobia, and the Terror|journal=French Historical Studies|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|location=Durham, North Carolina|volume=26|issue=4|date=Fall 2003|pages=579–617|doi=10.1215/00161071-26-4-579|s2cid=154852467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of France saw her death as a necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had done its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chantal|last=Thomas|title=The Wicked Queen: The Origins of the Myth of Marie Antoinette|translator=Julie Rose|publisher=Zone Books|location=New York City|date=2001|isbn=0942299396|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie-Antoinette is also known for her taste for fine things, and her commissions from famous craftsmen, such as [[Jean Henri Riesener|Jean-Henri Riesener]], suggest more about her enduring legacy as a woman of taste and patronage. For instance, a writing table attributed to Riesener, now located at [[Waddesdon Manor]], bears witness to Marie-Antoinette's desire to escape the oppressive formality of court life, when she decided to move the table from the Queen's boudoir de la Meridienne at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] to her humble interior, the [[Petit Trianon]]. Her favourite objects filled her small, private chateau and reveal aspects of Marie-Antoinette's character that have been obscured by satirical political prints, such as those in Les Tableaux de la Révolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waddesdon.org.uk/blog/celebrating-marie-antoinette-on-her-birthday/|title=Celebrating Marie-Antoinette on her birthday|last=Jenner|first=Victoria|date=12 November 2019|website=Waddesdon Manor|access-date=18 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservatism, the [[Catholic Church]], wealth, and fashion. She has been the subject of a number of books, films, and other media. Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of [[class conflict]], western [[aristocracy]] and [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]]. Some of her contemporaries, such as Thomas Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Jefferson"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Jefferson|author-link=Thomas Jefferson|title=Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJpuhuAIzo8C&amp;q=%E2%80%9CI+have+ever+believed+that+had+there+been+no+queen%2C+there+would+have+been+no+revolution.%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%A6Thomas+Jefferson&amp;pg=PA92|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|location=Mineola, New York|access-date=29 March 2013|quote=I have ever believed that had there been no queen, there would have been no revolution.|isbn=978-0486137902|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Marie Antoinette}}
The phrase "[[Let them eat cake]]" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence that she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a journalistic cliché.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2001|pp=xviii, 160}}; {{Harvnb|Lever|2006|pp=63–65}}; {{Harvnb|Lanser|2003|pp=273–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s autobiographical work ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Les Confessions]]'', finished in 1767 and published in 1782: "''Enfin Je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande Princesse à qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui répondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche''" ("Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat [[brioche]]{{'"}}). Rousseau ascribes these words to a "great princess", but the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette's arrival in France. Some think that he invented it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1990|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, expressions of gratitude to France for its help in the [[American Revolution]] included naming a city [[Marietta, Ohio]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant, pp. 14, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Her life has been the subject of many films, such as ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (1938) and ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=luizhadsen Paulnewton|title=Marie Antoinette 2006 Full Movie|date=24 September 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEiSnzwO5uE|access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her biological children, Marie Antoinette adopted four children: "Armand" [[Francois-Michel Gagné]] (c. 1771–1792), a poor orphan adopted  in 1776; [[Jean Amilcar]] (c. 1781–1793), a Senegalese [[slave]] boy given to the queen as a present by [[Chevalier de Boufflers]] in 1787, but whom she instead had freed, baptized, adopted and placed in a pension; [[Ernestine Lambriquet]] (1778–1813), daughter of two servants at the palace, who was raised as the playmate of her daughter and whom she adopted after the death of her mother in 1788; and finally [["Zoe" Jeanne Louise Victoire]] (1787-?), who was adopted in 1790 along with her two older sisters when her parents, an usher and his wife in service of the king, had died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Philippe Huisman, Marguerite Jallut: ''Marie Antoinette'', Stephens, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these, only Armand, Ernestine, and Zoe actually lived with the royal family: Jean Amilcar, along with the elder siblings of Zoe and Armand who were also formally foster children of the royal couple, simply lived at the queen's expense until her imprisonment, which proved fatal for at least Amilcar, as he was evicted from the boarding school when the fee was no longer paid, and reportedly starved to death on the street.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Armand and Zoe had a position which was more similar to that of Ernestine; Armand lived at court with the king and queen until he left them at the outbreak of the revolution because of his republican sympathies, and Zoe was chosen to be the playmate of the Dauphin, just as Ernestine had once been selected as the playmate of Marie-Therese, and sent away to her sisters in a convent boarding school before the Flight to Varennes in 1791.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
