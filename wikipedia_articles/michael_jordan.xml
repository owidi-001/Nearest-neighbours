'''Michael Jeffrey Jordan''' (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials '''MJ''',&lt;ref&gt;Rein, Kotler and Shields, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American businessman and former professional [[basketball]] player. He is the principal owner and chairman of the [[Charlotte Hornets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and of [[23XI Racing]] in the [[NASCAR Cup Series]]. He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. His biography on the official [[NBA]] website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."&lt;ref name="nbah"/&gt; He was integral in helping to popularize the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Markovits"&gt;Markovits and Rensman, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a global [[cultural icon]] in the process.&lt;ref name="faze.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://faze.ca/michael-jordan-a-global-icon/ |title=Michael Jordan: A Global Icon |work=Faze|access-date=August 18, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan played [[college basketball]] for three seasons under coach [[Dean Smith]] with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in [[1982 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1982]]. Jordan joined the Bulls in [[1984–85 NBA season|1984]] as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.&lt;ref name="defensive players"&gt;Berkow, Ira. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/15/sports/sports-of-the-times-air-jordan-and-just-plain-folks.html "Sports of The Times; Air Jordan And Just Plain Folks"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 15, 1991. Retrieved January 1, 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames "'''Air Jordan'''" and "'''His Airness'''". Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], and followed that achievement with titles in [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], securing a "[[three-peat]]". Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the [[1993–94 NBA season]] to play [[Minor League Baseball]] but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]], as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the [[1995–96 NBA season]]. He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], ten [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|scoring titles]] (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors (joint record), fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] selections, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[List of National Basketball Association annual steals leaders|steals titles]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and  career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], once in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.

One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation,&lt;ref name="Markovits"/&gt; Jordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.&lt;ref name="remain popular"&gt;{{cite web |last=Skidmore |first=Sarah |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004116738_airjordan10.html |title=23 years later, Air Jordans maintain mystique |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=January 10, 2008 |access-date=February 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216000115/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004116738_airjordan10.html |archive-date=February 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 live-action animated film ''[[Space Jam]]'', and is the central focus of the [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary miniseries ''[[The Last Dance (miniseries)|The Last Dance]]'' (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now named the Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net worth of $1.6&amp;nbsp;billion, he is the fifth-richest African American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F. Smith]], [[David Steward]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], and [[Kanye West]].

Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the [[Varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his sophomore year; at 5'11" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level.

Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized."&lt;ref name="Hoop"/&gt; During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.&lt;ref name="cash in"&gt;Rovell, Darren.

Retrieved June 4, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[The Last Dance (miniseries)|The Last Dance]]'', a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on [[ESPN]] in April and May 2020. ''The Last Dance'' relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an [[NBA Entertainment]] crew had shot over the course of the [[1997–98 NBA season]] for use in a documentary.  The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shelburne |first=Ramona |title=An all-access Michael Jordan documentary?
