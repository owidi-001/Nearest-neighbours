'''William Jefferson Clinton''' ([[Birth name|né]] '''Blythe III'''; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 42nd [[president of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Prior to his [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|presidency]], he served as [[governor of Arkansas]] from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992 and as [[attorney general of Arkansas]] from 1977 to 1979. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Clinton was known as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], and many of his policies reflected a [[centrist]] "[[Third Way]]" political philosophy. He is the husband of [[Hillary Clinton]], who was the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (2009–2013) and ran for president in 2008 and 2016.

Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended [[Georgetown University]], [[University College, Oxford]], and [[Yale Law School]]. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and they were married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]]. Clinton was elected president in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], defeating incumbent Republican President [[George H. W. Bush]]. At age 46, he became the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|third-youngest president]] in history.

Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], but failed to pass his plan for [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|national health care reform]]. In the [[1994 United States elections|1994 elections]], the Republican Party [[Republican Revolution|won unified control]] of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], however, he was reelected in a landslide.  He passed [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], as well as financial deregulation measures. He also appointed [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian]] and [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] wars, signed the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace agreement]], signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] in opposition to [[Saddam Hussein]], participated in the [[Oslo I Accord]] and [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David Summit]] to advance the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]], and assisted the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. In 1998, [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached. The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] for the purpose of concealing his [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|affair]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]], a 22-year-old [[White House intern]]. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his second term in office.

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office [[approval rating]] of any U.S. president since 1945. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|historical rankings of U.S. presidents]]. However, he has also been subject to substantial criticism for his [[Bill Clinton sexual assault and misconduct allegations|sex scandals]], especially in the wake of the [[Me Too movement]]. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the [[Clinton Foundation]] to address international causes such as the prevention of [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[global warming]]. In 2009, he was named the United Nations [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Special Envoy]] to [[Haiti]], and after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], he teamed up with [[George W. Bush]] to form the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]]. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning in his wife's presidential campaigns in the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2008]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] presidential elections.

Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-President-Bill-Clinton/3|title=Oprah Talks to Bill Clinton|work=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]] |date=August 2004 |access-date=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward him.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, [[Roger Clinton Jr.]] He threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First in His Class"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maraniss|first=David |author-link=David Maraniss |title=First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton|publisher=Touchstone|year=1996|isbn=0-684-81890-6|url=https://archive.org/details/firstinhisclass00davi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]], where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; Clinton was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':{{block indent|Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]]. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be [[Michael DeBakey]]. But I knew I could be great in public service.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;}}

Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient [[Roman Senator|Roman senator]] [[Catiline]] in a mock trial in his Latin class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/bill-clinton-facts_n_3497083.html | title=10 Things You Definitely Didn't Know About Bill Clinton | work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]] | date=June 25, 2013 | first=Jimmy | last=Soni |author-link=Jimmy Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a vigorous defense that made use of his "budding rhetorical and political skills", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it "made him realize that someday he would study law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton | first=David | last=Maraniss |author-link=David Maraniss | year=1996 | publisher=Touchstone | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt; The other was watching [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s 1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech on TV, which impressed him so much that he later memorized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) | publisher=[[The White House]] | url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | access-date=August 30, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719152125/http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | archive-date=July 19, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College and law school years==

===Georgetown University===

[[File:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|Clinton ran for president of the [[Georgetown University Student Association|Student Council]] while attending the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]].]]

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] degree in 1968. Georgetown was the only school where Clinton applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kiefer |first1=Francine |title=Clinton: The Early Years |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1998/0529/052998.us.us.3.html |access-date=April 9, 2021 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=May 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for [[class president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Levin|title=Bill Clinton: The Inside Story|url=https://archive.org/details/billclinton00robe|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=SP Books|isbn=978-1-56171-177-2|pages=xxiv–xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; While in college, he became a brother of service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apo.org/leadershipdevelopment | title=About Leadership | publisher=APO.org | access-date=April 7, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101064634/http://apo.org/Leadershipdevelopment | archive-date=January 1, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. Clinton was also a member of the [[DeMolay International|Order of DeMolay]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://demolay.org/project/william-j-clinton/ DeMolay – Hall Of Fame » William Clinton], quote: "Clinton was initiated into Hot Springs Chapter in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1961, where he served as Master Councilor.

===Oxford===

Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]], where he initially read for a [[B.Phil.]] in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|philosophy, politics, and economics]] but transferred to a [[B.Litt.]] in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-bill-clinton-we-knew-at-oxford-apart-from-smoking-dope-and-not-inhaling-what-else-did-he-learn-1556769.html|title=The Bill Clinton we knew at Oxford: Apart from smoking dope (and not inhaling), what else did he learn over here? College friends share their memories with Matthew Hoffman|first=Matthew|last=Hoffman|date=October 11, 1992|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and so he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at [[Yale Law School]], [[Yale University]], and so he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dowd"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/world/oxford-journal-whereas-he-is-an-old-boy-if-a-young-chief-honor-him.html | title=Oxford Journal; Whereas, He Is an Old Boy, If a Young Chief, Honor Him | last=Dowd | first=Maureen | author-link=Maureen Dowd | work=The New York Times | date=June 9, 1994 | access-date=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Hitch-22: A Memoir | first=Christopher | last=Hitchens |author-link=Christopher Hitchens | chapter=Chris or Christopher? | pages=106–107 | publisher=Atlantic books | location= London | isbn= 978-1-84354-922-2| date=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft]] letter that mandated deployment to the [[Vietnam War]]. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/22/magazine/most-likely-to-succeed.html|title=Most Likely to Succeed|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley |author-link=Alessandra Stanley |date=November 22, 1992|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; British writer and feminist [[Sara Maitland]] said of Clinton, "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things".&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt; Clinton was a member of the [[Oxford University Men's Basketball|Oxford University Basketball Club]] and also played for Oxford University's [[rugby union]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Rugby Union for Dummies |first1=Nick | last1=Cain |first2=Greg | last2=Growden |author2-link=Greg Growden |name-list-style=amp | chapter=21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby | page=297 | edition=2 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | location= [[Chichester]], England | isbn=978-0-470-03537-5|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the [[University of Oxford]], specifically for being "a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace", having "a powerful collaborator in his wife," and for winning "general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget".&lt;ref name="Dowd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/doctor-without-a-thesis-bill-clinton-gets-an-oxford-degree-today-but-jonathan-eyals-verdict-on-his-1421189.html|title=Doctor without a thesis: Bill Clinton gets an Oxford degree today, but Jonathan Eyal's verdict on his term's work is: a disaster|first=Jonathan|last=Eyal|date=June 8, 1994|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy===

During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil A. Hamilton|title=Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfbt5NXvF64C&amp;pg=PA366|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0816-2|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Oxford, he participated in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War protests]] and organized a [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] event in October 1969.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt; He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and the [[Air Force Officer Training School|Air Force officer candidate school]], and he then made arrangements to join the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program at the [[University of Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M.

He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way "to maintain my political viability within the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Clinton | agency=The Associated Press | title=The 1992 Campaign; A Letter By Clinton On His Draft Deferment: 'A War I Opposed And Despised' | work=The New York Times | date=February 13, 1992 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/13/us/1992-campaign-letter-clinton-his-draft-deferment-war-opposed-despised.html | access-date=July 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers{{nbsp}}1 to 310 would be [[Draft lottery (1969)|drafted]] before him, making it unlikely he would be called up.

[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a [[notarize]]d statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:{{block indent|I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright's office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to the [[ROTC]] program&amp;nbsp;...

During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]], which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam.

===Law school===

After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree in 1973.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt; In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the [[Lillian Goldman Law Library|Yale Law Library]]; she was a class year ahead of him.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRCBio"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/about/first-ladies/hillaryclinton | work=[[whitehouse.gov]] | title=Hillary Rodham Clinton | via=[[NARA|National Archives]] | access-date=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the [[George McGovern]] [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|campaign]] for the [[1972 United States presidential election]] in order to move in with her in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/national/clintons-berkeley-summer-of-love/66982 | title=The Clintons' Berkeley Summer of Love | first=Josh | last=Gerstein | work=The New York Sun | date=November 26, 2007 | access-date=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple continued [[cohabitating|living together]] in New Haven when they returned to law school.&lt;ref name="nys-rad"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/national/hillary-clintons-radical-summer/66933/ |title=Hillary Clinton's Radical Summer |first=Josh | last=Gerstein |work=The New York Sun |date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton eventually [[1972 United States presidential election in Texas#McGovern campaign|moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972]] to take a job leading McGovern's effort there.

After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Running in the conservative [[Arkansas's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]] against incumbent Republican [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the [[Watergate scandal]]. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52&amp;nbsp;percent to 48&amp;nbsp;percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for [[Arkansas Attorney General|Arkansas attorney general]].

In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in [[1978 Arkansas gubernatorial election|1978]], having defeated the Republican candidate [[Lynn Lowe]], a farmer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]].

However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the [[Mariel boatlift]]) detained in [[Fort Chaffee]] in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger [[Frank D. White]] in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt;

Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years.

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]]. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special [[Arkansas General Assembly|legislative session]]—the longest in Arkansas history.&lt;ref name=pendleton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pendleton|first1=Scott | title=Governor Gets High Marks for Public Education Reforms | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0721/21062.html | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=July 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Natural" /&gt; He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]] businessmen [[Woody Freeman]] (1984), and [[Sheffield Nelson]] of Little Rock (1990).&lt;ref name=AllPolitics1 /&gt;

===1992 presidential campaign===

In the first primary contest, the [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa Caucus]], Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa senator [[Tom Harkin]]. During the campaign for the [[New Hampshire primary]], reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with [[Gennifer Flowers]]. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts senator [[Paul Tsongas]] in the New Hampshire polls.&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt; Following [[Super Bowl XXVI]], Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the [[1992 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire primary]], but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him "The Comeback Kid" for earning a firm second-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Herstek |url=https://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/11/clinton.nh/index.html |title=Clinton thanks New Hampshire for making him the 'Comeback Kid' |date=January 11, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=February 22, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] on [[Super Tuesday]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Choice" /&gt; With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.&lt;ref name="The Choice" /&gt; Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.&lt;ref name="First in His Class" /&gt;

[[File:Clinton family.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Clintons in a [[White House]] Christmas portrait]]
During the campaign, questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.&lt;ref name="My Life" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Ifill | first=Gwen | title=Hillary Clinton Defends Her Conduct in Law Firm | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/17/us/the-1992-campaign-hillary-clinton-defends-her-conduct-in-law-firm.html | date=March 17, 1992 | access-date=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents "for the price of one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last1=MacGillis | first1=Alec |last2=Kornblut |first2=Anne E. | title=Hillary Clinton Embraces Her Husband's Legacy | work=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/21/AR2007122102588.html | page=A1 | date=December 21, 2007 | access-date=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton was still the governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a possible political move to counter "soft on crime" accusations.&lt;ref name="mbsrgd"&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-316-92919-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Applebome | first=Peter | title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/us/1992-campaign-death-penalty-arkansas-execution-raises-questions-governor-s.html | work=The New York Times | date=January 25, 1992 | access-date=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's [[United States presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] were around 80&amp;nbsp;percent during the [[Gulf War]], and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promise not to raise taxes]], which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.&lt;ref name="The Choice" /&gt; By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name="The Choice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=How the Presidents Stack Up: A look at U.S. presidents' job-approval ratings | work=The Wall Street Journal | year=2006 | url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html | access-date=October 30, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025015927/http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-presapp0605-31.html| archive-date= October 25, 2008 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue.

On March 26, 1992, during a Democratic [[Fundraising|fund raiser]] of the presidential campaign, [[Robert Rafsky]] confronted then Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and asked what he was going to do about [[AIDS]], to which Clinton replied, "I feel your pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.thinkprogress.org/the-future-of-gay-parents-on-television-378cc67a76b5/|title=The Future of Gay Parents On Television|work=ThinkProgress|first=Alyssa|last=Rosenberg|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The televised exchange led to AIDS becoming an issue in the 1992 presidential election. On April 4, then candidate Clinton met with members of [[ACT UP]] and other leading AIDS advocates to discuss his AIDS agenda and agreed to make a major AIDS policy speech, to have people with HIV speak to the [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic Convention]], and to sign onto the [[AIDS United]] Action five point plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://actupny.org/campaign96/rafsky-clinton.html|title=The ACT UP Historical Archive: Bob Rafsky Confronts Candidate Bill Clinton, 1992|website=actupny.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton won the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]] (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.&lt;ref name=BBConthisday /&gt; Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years.

According to [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A rare event was the a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, "The significance of the 1992 election."

Clinton was [[First inauguration of Bill Clinton|inaugurated]] as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Clinton was physically exhausted of the time, and had an inexperienced staff. His high levels of public support dropped in the first few weeks, as he made a series of embarrassing mistakes. His first choice for attorney general had not paid her taxes on babysitters and was forced to withdraw. The second appointee also withdrew for the same reason. Clinton had repeatedly promised to encourage gays in the military service, despite what he knew to be the strong opposition of the military leadership. He tried anyway, and was publicly opposed by the top generals, and forced by Congress to a compromise position of "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" whereby gays could serve if and only if they kept it secret.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Drew, ''On the Edge: The Clinton Presidency'' (1994), pp. 36–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  He devised a $16 billion stimulus package primarily to aid inner-city programs desired by liberals, but it was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Drew, pp 114–122.&lt;/ref&gt; His popularity at the 100 day mark of his term was the lowest of any president at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley A. Renshon, ed., ''The Clinton Presidency: Campaigning, Governing, and the Psychology of Leadership'' (1995), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Public opinion did support one liberal program, and Clinton signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00011 | title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress—1st Session | publisher=United States Senate | access-date= August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |title=New Nationwide Poll Shows Strong Support for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) |publisher=Protect Family Leave |access-date=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227065806/http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |archive-date=December 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international [[family planning]] programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon L. Camp|chapter=The Politics of U.S. Population Assistance|title=Beyond the Numbers: A Reader on Population, Consumption and the Environment|editor=Laurie Ann Mazur|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said abortion should be kept "safe, legal, and rare"—a slogan that had been suggested by political scientist [[Samuel L.

On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a [[budget deficit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/us/white-house-hones-all-out-campaign-to-sell-sacrifice.html | title=White House Hones All-Out Campaign to Sell Sacrifice | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 15, 1993 | author=Richard L.

President Clinton's attorney general [[Janet Reno]] authorized the FBI's use of armored vehicles to deploy tear gas into the buildings of the Branch Davidian community near Waco, Texas, in hopes of ending a [[Waco siege|51 day siege]]. During the operation on April 19, 1993, the buildings caught fire and 75 of the residents died, including 24 children. The raid had originally been planned by the Bush administration; Clinton had played no role.&lt;ref&gt;Mollie Dickenson, "A Bipartisan Disaster" ''New York Times'' August 3, 1995, p.

On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the [[White House travel office controversy]] even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be [[At-will employment|dismissed without cause]].

In August, Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], which passed Congress without a Republican vote.

On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]]; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer [[John F. Harris]] said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.&lt;ref name="The Survivor" /&gt; Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by [[George J.

In November 1993, [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]]—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged that while governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured Hale to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name="salon031798"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jonathan | last1=Broder |author2-link=Murray Waas |first2=Murray | last2=Waas | url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html | title=The Road To Hale | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | date=March 17, 1998 | access-date=August 25, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616194202/http://salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html | archive-date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.

On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], which mandated federal [[background check]]s on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|NICS system]] was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low-income workers.&lt;ref name="The Survivor" /&gt;

In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in ''[[The American Spectator]].'' In the affair later known as "[[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]]", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]]. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated "bad journalism", and that "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse | title=Reporter Apologizes For Clinton Sex Article | publisher=CNN | date=March 10, 1998 | first=Jonathan | last=Karl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614124146/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/| archive-date=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feder |first1=Jody | title="Don't Ask, Don't Tell": A Legal Analysis | publisher=DIANE Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4379-2208-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including senators [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA). According to [[David Mixner]], Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that "the President should lift the ban&amp;nbsp;... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress".&lt;ref name="Mixner2009"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mixner | first=David | title=Stranger Among Friends | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Jeg2X025UgC| date=November 25, 2009 | publisher=Random House Publishing Group | isbn=978-0-307-42958-2 | pages=495–497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stranger Among Friends—book reviews |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 |newspaper=[[Washington Monthly]] |first=John | last=Cloud |date=November 1996 |access-date=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826114431/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826/ |archive-date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President [[Harry S.

Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.&lt;ref name="The Natural" /&gt; Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not "out of whack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html | title=President seeks better implementation of 'don't ask, don't tell' | date=December 11, 1999 | publisher=CNN | access-date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy remained controversial, and was finally [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|repealed in 2011]], removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Obama certifies end of military's gay ban | agency=[[Reuters]] | work=[[NBC News]] | date=July 22, 2011 | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43859711 | access-date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.&lt;ref name=NAFTA&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Don C. Livingston |author2=Kenneth A. Wink | title=The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck? | journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly | volume=27 | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.&lt;ref name=NAFTA /&gt;

The [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act|Omnibus Crime Bill]], which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HR 3355—Omnibus Crime Bill | url=https://votesmart.org/bill/2666/8428/omnibus-crime-bill | publisher=votesmart.org | access-date=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, "My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Clinton |date=February 25, 2015 |url=http://www.4to40.com/biographies-for-kids/bill-clinton/ |publisher=4to40.com |access-date=February 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included a subsection of [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|assault weapons ban]] for a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey A.

According to Robert Longley, "Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011—Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Robert | last=Longley | url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201a.htm | title=The Clinton White House Web Site: Part 1: Perhaps the most important Web site in American history | publisher=About.com | access-date=June 6, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118024833/http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa012201a.htm | archive-date=January 18, 2017 | url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A speech delivered by President Bill Clinton at the December 6, 1995 [[White House Conference]] on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection would be developed. The President focused on his administration's accomplishments and efforts related to the [[epidemic]], including an accelerated drug-approval process. He also condemned [[homophobia]] and discrimination against people with [[HIV]]. Clinton announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate AIDS research throughout the [[Federal government]]; convening public health experts to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse prevention; and launching a new effort by the [[Justice Department]] to ensure that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Activists at gathering plead with Clinton to take the lead |journal=AIDS Policy &amp; Law |date=December 29, 1995 |volume=10 |issue=22 |pages=1, 10 |pmid=11362952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White House FBI files controversy]] of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to [[FBI]] security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert | last=Ray |author-link=Robert Ray (prosecutor) |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/icreport/marceca/sec1-2.pdf |title=Final Report of the Independent Counsel&amp;nbsp;... of the Investigation In Re: Anthony Marceca |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |date=March 16, 2000 |access-date=August 30, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000, Independent Counsel [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]] determined there was no credible evidence of any crime.

On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-104publ199 | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | title=PUBLIC LAW 104–199—DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Yandura]], speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA "was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a "very reactionary Congress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/bill-clinton-doma-2012-3/ | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | first=Frank | last=Rich | title=Bill Clinton's shifting justifications for signing the Defense of Marriage Act | date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration spokesman [[Richard Socarides]] said, "the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected."&lt;ref name=metroweekly&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.metroweekly.com/2011/09/becoming-law/ | work=[[Metro Weekly]] | first=Chris | last=Geidner | title=Becoming Law | date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton himself said DOMA was something "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/bill-clinton-doma-2012-3/ | title=Bill Clinton's Justifications for Signing DOMA—New York Magazine | work=New York | access-date=February 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist [[Evan Wolfson]] has called these claims "historic revisionism".&lt;ref name=metroweekly /&gt; In a July 2, 2011, editorial ''The New York Times'' opined, "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/opinion/sunday/03sun1.html | work=The New York Times | title=Unfinished Business: The Defense of Marriage Act | date=July 2, 2011 | department=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in [[United States v.

During his visit to the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Discovery TV | title=Clinton Assassination Attempt—Secret Service Secrets | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvhldq-OHK0 | via=YouTube | access-date=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to officials, the IED was large enough to "blow up the entire presidential motorcade".&lt;ref name="Crown Publishing Group"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gormley|first1=Ken | title=The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr | date=February 1, 2011 | publisher=Crown Publishing Group | isbn=978-0-307-40945-4 | page=800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by [[Lewis C. Merletti]], former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.&lt;ref name="youtube.com" /&gt; This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.&lt;ref name="Crown Publishing Group" /&gt; Once more, the word "wedding" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.&lt;ref name="Crown Publishing Group" /&gt; Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=N.A. | title=Bombs Found As Manila Readies For APEC Summit | work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.&lt;ref name="Explosives Found Near Summit Site"&gt;{{cite news|last1=N.A. | title=Explosives Found Near Summit Site | agency=Associated Press | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.&lt;ref name="Explosives Found Near Summit Site" /&gt; The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as [[al-Qaeda]] and the plot was masterminded by [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name="Crown Publishing Group" /&gt; Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.&lt;ref name="Crown Publishing Group" /&gt;

===1996 presidential election===
[[File:ElectoralCollege1996.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|1996 electoral vote results]]

In the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential election]], Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2 percent of the popular vote over Republican [[Bob Dole]] (40.7 percent of the popular vote) and [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform]] candidate Ross Perot (8.4 percent of the popular vote). Clinton received 379 of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. He became the first Democratic incumbent since [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to be elected president more than once.&lt;ref name="Clinton@2"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Jones | first=Charles O. | title=The Presidency in a Separated System | url=https://archive.org/details/presidencysepara00jone | url-access=limited | publisher=[[The Brookings Institution]] | year=2005 | page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencysepara00jone/page/n336 318]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term (1997–2001)===

In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators [[Ted Kennedy]]—a Democrat—and [[Orrin Hatch]]—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shogren | first=Elizabeth | title=Clinton to Get Hearing Aids for Both Ears | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-oct-04-mn-39089-story.html | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=October 4, 1997 | access-date=February 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]], which repealed the part of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of [[Investment banking|investment]], [[commercial bank]]ing, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 | url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/gramm_leach_bliley_act | publisher=Federal Reserve History | access-date=February 22, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Impeachment inquiry against Bill Clinton|a House inquiry]], Clinton was [[impeachment|impeached]] on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228–206 to impeach him for perjury to a [[grand jury]]&lt;ref name=ai&gt;{{cite web | author = Miller, Lorraine C. | title = Final vote results for roll call 543 | publisher = Office of the Clerk | date = December 19, 1998 | url = http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll543.xml | access-date = April 20, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100106230404/http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll543.xml | archive-date = January 6, 2010 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and voted 221–212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.&lt;ref name=aiii&gt;{{cite web | author = Miller, Lorraine C. | title = Final vote results for roll call 545 | publisher = Office of the Clerk | date = December 19, 1998 | url = http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll545.xml | access-date = April 20, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100302015416/http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll545.xml | archive-date = March 2, 2010 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after [[Andrew Johnson]]) to be impeached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-clinton-impeached|title=President Clinton impeached|work=This Day in History {{!}} December 19|publisher=HISTORY|access-date=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-have-presidents-been-impeached-for-these-were-the-articles-of-impeachment-johnson-nixon-and-clinton/|title=What have presidents been impeached for?

To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a [[lame-duck session]] in December 1998.

[[File:Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|Future president [[Donald Trump]] and Clinton shaking hands at [[Trump Tower (Manhattan)|Trump Tower]], June 2000]]
While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during ''[[Clinton v. Jones|Jones v. Clinton]],'' Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm | title=Case Closed | first=Dan | last=Froomkin | work=The Washington Post | date=August 26, 1999 | access-date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.

The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.&lt;ref name=senvoteai&gt;{{cite web | author=Senate LIS | title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 106th Congress—1st Session: vote number 17—Guilty or Not Guilty (Art I, Articles of Impeachment v.

The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.&lt;ref name=senvoteai /&gt;

On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the ''Jones'' case.&lt;ref name="arkcomm"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Neal v.

She was later replaced by then-Republican [[James Comey]], who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part.

====Somalia====

The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, [[MH-60 Black Hawk|two U.S. helicopters]] were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The people killed them. Chopped them up.

====Rwanda====
In April 1994, [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] broke out in [[Rwanda]]. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a "final solution to eliminate all Tutsis" was underway, long before the administration publicly used the word "genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrol|first=Rory|title=US chose to ignore Rwandan genocide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=April 1, 2004|access-date=February 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228191139/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda|archive-date=December 28, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] |title=Secretary [of State Warren Christopher]'s Morning Summary |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB117/Rw23.pdf |date=April 26, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |title=National Intelligence Daily |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB117/Rw34.pdf |date=April 23, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambush in Mogadishu: Transcript |publisher=[[PBS]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/script.html |access-date=October 27, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506142008/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/script.html |archive-date=May 6, 2009 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying "I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down.

In 1995, U.S. and [[NATO]] aircraft [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|bombed Bosnian Serb targets]] to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the [[Bosnian war]]. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent [[Dayton Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, 2001, pp 349–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish peace talks====

In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to [[Northern Ireland]], but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. In 1994, Clinton angered London by granting a visa to [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit [[Northern Ireland]], seeing both the divided communities of [[Belfast]] and later famously shaking Adams' hand, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during [[the Troubles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/30/newsid_4459000/4459860.stm|title=1995: Clinton kindles hope in Northern Ireland|date=November 30, 1995 |language=en-GB |access-date=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace talks]], which eventually led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1065913.stm|title=Clinton: His role in Northern Ireland|date=December 11, 2000 |language=en-GB |access-date=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====

In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8{{nbsp}}million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|131.8|1996|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the [[International Court of Justice]] after the shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by the U.S. Navy [[guided missile cruiser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/07/the-vincennes-downing-of-iran-air-flight-655-the-united-states-tried-to-cover-up-its-own-destruction-of-a-passenger-plane.html | title=America's Flight 17 | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|first=Fred|last=Kaplan | date=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Osama bin Laden====

Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until [[Death of Osama bin Laden|bin Laden's death in 2011]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html | title=Bill Clinton: I got closer to killing bin Laden | publisher=CNN | date=September 24, 2006 | access-date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims by [[Mansoor Ijaz]] and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-05-oe-ijaz05-story.html | title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize | work=Los Angeles Times | date=December 5, 2001 | access-date=February 22, 2020 | first=Mansoor | last=Ijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[9/11 Commission Report]] stated that "we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_5.pdf | title=Staff Statement No. 5 | publisher=9/11 Commission | access-date=February 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1998, Clinton [[Operation Infinite Reach|ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan]], targeting the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]] in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=John | last=Pike | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bgm-109-operation.htm | title=BGM-109 Tomahawk—Smart Weapons | publisher=Globalsecurity.org | access-date=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of a brutal crackdown on [[Kosovo Liberation Army|ethnic Albanian separatists]] in the province of [[Kosovo]] by the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named [[Operation Allied Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clines |first1=Francis X. |title=NATO Opens Broad Barrage Against Serbs as Clinton Denounces 'Brutal Repression' |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/europe/032599kosovo-rdp.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the [[ethnic cleansing]] (and what the Clinton administration labeled [[genocide]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=William |date=April 7, 1999 |url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=582 |title=Secretary Cohen's Press Conference at NATO Headquarters |access-date=February 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton |first=Bill |date=August 30, 2011 |url=http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html |title=Press Conference by the President |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054609/http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html |archive-date=October 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Albanians by Yugoslav anti-guerilla military units.

Relations were damaged briefly by the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in May 1999.

The [[United States–China Relations Act of 2000|U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000]] granted China [[permanent normal trade relations]] (NTR) status (previously called [[most favoured nation]] (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR.

It requires China to open its markets—with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world—to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways," said Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/Full_Text_of_Clintons_Speech_on_China_Trade_Bi.htm "Text of Clinton's Speech on China Trade Bill"], Federal News Service, March 9, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israeli-Palestinian conflict====

After initial successes such as the [[Oslo Accords]] of the early 1990s, which also led to the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] in 1994 and the [[Wye River Memorandum]] in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/12/bush.clinton.poll/index.html | title=Poll: Clinton outperformed Bush | publisher=CNN | date=May 15, 2006 | access-date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Saad, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/26608/lincoln-resumes-position-americans-toprated-president.aspx Lincoln Resumes Position as Americans' Top-Rated President: Reagan and Clinton lead among members of their respective parties], Gallup (February 19, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Newport, [Americans Say Reagan Is the Greatest U.S. President: Lincoln and Clinton next on the list; Washington fifth], Gallup (February 18, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F.

Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.&lt;ref name="hallmark1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abuse-allegations-have-revived-scrutiny-of-bill-clinton--and-divided-democrats/2017/11/17/3d1711c8-cba4-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html|title=Abuse allegations have revived scrutiny of Bill Clinton—and divided Democrats|first1=Karen|last1=Tumulty|first2=Katie|last2=Mettler|date=November 17, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=November 19, 2017 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119050428/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abuse-allegations-have-revived-scrutiny-of-bill-clinton--and-divided-democrats/2017/11/17/3d1711c8-cba4-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html|archive-date=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mccoy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729|title=Bill Clinton: A Reckoning|first=Caitlin|last=Flanagan|website=The Atlantic|date=November 13, 2017|access-date=November 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118231945/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729/|archive-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/17/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-bill-clinton-democrats/index.html|title=Should Democrats turn their backs on Bill Clinton?|first=Z.
