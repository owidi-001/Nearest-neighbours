The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, but takes its name from the [[Angles]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe deriving its name from the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries.

England's terrain is chiefly low hills and [[plain]]s, especially in central and southern England. However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the [[Lake District]] and [[Pennines]]) and in the west (for example, [[Dartmoor]] and the [[Shropshire Hills]]). The capital is [[London]], which has the largest metropolitan area in both the United Kingdom and, prior to [[Brexit]], the [[European Union]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to the [[Eurostat|European Statistical Agency]], London was the largest [[Larger urban zone]] in the EU, a measure of metropolitan area which comprises a city's urban core as well as its surrounding commuting zone.

The [[Kingdom of England]] – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a separate [[sovereign state]] on 1 May 1707, when the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] put into effect the terms agreed in the [[Treaty of Union]] the previous year, resulting in a political union with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;William E.

In 1922 the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|renamed]] the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/ireland/articles/the-partition-of-ireland-a-short-history/|title=The Partition Of Ireland: A Short History|last=Phelan|first=Kate|website=Culture Trip|access-date=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy{{Anchor|Etymology}}==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{See also|Toponymy of England}}
The name "England" is derived from the [[Old English]] name ''Englaland'', which means "land of the [[Angles]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England |title=England |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angles were one of the [[Germanic tribes]] that settled in Great Britain during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Angles came from the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] peninsula in the [[Bay of Kiel]] area (present-day German state of [[Schleswig–Holstein]]) of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term, as "Engla londe", is in the late-ninth-century translation into [[Old English]] of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''. The term was then used in a different sense to the modern one, meaning "the land inhabited by the English", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the ''Chronicle'' stated that King [[Malcolm III]] went "out of Scotlande into [[Lothian]] in Englaland", thus using it in the more ancient sense.{{sfn|Molyneaux|2015|pp=6–7}}

The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', in which the [[Latin]] word ''Anglii'' is used.&lt;ref name="Fordham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |title=Germania |publisher=[[Tacitus]] |access-date=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an ''angular'' shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Angle&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=Angle |dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |access-date=5 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the [[Saxons]], came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain ''Angli Saxones'' or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony between the Weser and Eider rivers in Northern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crystal|2004| pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scottish Gaelic]], another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (''Sasunn'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=John |title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar |year=1848 |publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is "''Saesneg''". A romantic name for England is [[Lloegyr|Loegria]], related to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for England, ''Lloegr'', and made popular by its use in [[Arthurian legend]]. ''[[Albion]]'' is also applied to England in a more poetic capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though its original meaning is the island of Britain as a whole.

The earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/the-timeline-of-britain/boxgrove.htm |title=500,000 BC&amp;nbsp;– Boxgrove |access-date=20 December 2010 |website=Current Archaeology |publisher=Current Publishing|date=24 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~sgs04rh/SWRivers/Palaeolithic%20Archaeology%20Teaching%20Resource%20Box_Lifestyles_Basic.pdf |title=Palaeolithic Archaeology Teaching Resource Box |publisher=Palaeolithic Rivers of South-West Britain Project(2006) |access-date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo-east.org.uk/special_projects/eco_culture.htm |title=Chalk east |publisher=A Geo East Project |access-date=20 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305032854/http://www.geo-east.org.uk/special_projects/eco_culture.htm |archive-date=5 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the last [[Last glacial period|ice age]] only large mammals such as [[mammoth]]s, [[bison]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]] remained. Roughly 11,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, when the [[ice sheets]] began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by [[land bridge]] to Ireland and [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/tectonics.html |title=Tertiary Rivers: Tectonic and structural background |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]], deriving from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, arrived from Central Europe. [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the [[Roman Republic]] attempted to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade twice]] in 55&amp;nbsp;BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|client king]] from the [[Trinovantes]].

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to [[Bede]], missionaries were sent from Rome by [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleutherius]] at the request of the chieftain [[Lucius of Britain]] in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through [[Joseph of Arimathea]], while others claim through [[Lucius of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 410, during the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]], Britain was left exposed by the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.&lt;ref name="james_anglosaxons" /&gt; Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] (5th-century Ireland) and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne) and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local "congregations" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.&lt;ref name="Lehane"&gt;See ''Early Christian Christianity'', Brendan Lehane, Constable, London: John Murray Ltd., 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, [[Angles]], [[Jutes]] and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province.

Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a [[Dark Age]]. The nature and progression of the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] is consequently subject to considerable disagreement; the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west, where Celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under Anglo-Saxon control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dark|first=Ken R.|title=Large-scale population movements into and from Britain south of Hadrian's Wall in the fourth to sixth centuries AD|year=2003|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2003-03_K._R._Dark,_Large-scale_population_movements_into_and_from_Britan_south_of_Hadrian's_Wall_in_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries_AD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby F.

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Wessex]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirby|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyon|1960|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the [[Danelaw]]. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under [[Æthelstan]] in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by [[Eadred]] in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013 and again by his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived [[North Sea Empire]] that also included [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1042.

During the [[Elizabethan period]], England was at war with Spain. An [[Spanish Armada|armada]] sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]]. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596]] and [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597]], but both were driven back by storms. The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the [[King of Scots]], [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as [[James VI and I|James I]], thereby creating a [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]].&lt;ref name="Britons"&gt;{{harvnb|Colley|1992|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making the Act of Union |url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |publisher=Parliament.uk |access-date=5 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609075346/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |archive-date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He styled himself [[King of Great Britain]], although this had no basis in English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf |title=The term "Great Britain" in the Middle Ages |last=Hay |first=Denys |publisher=ads.ahds.ac.uk |access-date=19 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325061737/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the auspices of King James VI and I the Authorised [[King James Version]] of the Holy Bible was published in 1611.

Power shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].{{refn|Figure of 550,000 military deaths is for England and Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cox|1970|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Two decades later, in [[World War II]], the United Kingdom was again one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

Since [[devolution]], in which other countries of the United Kingdom – Scotland, Wales and [[Northern Ireland]] – each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England.

[[File:Royal Courts of Justice (6201094569).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]]]]

The [[English law]] legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of [[common law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=248 |title=Common Law |publisher=ALM Media Properties |website=The People's Law Dictionary |access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal systems used in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~law/ASLH/conferences/2000conference/101900345b.htm |title=The Common Law in the British Empire |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date=19 October 2000 |access-date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (except [[Louisiana]]). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the [[Courts of England and Wales]] continued, under the [[Treaty of Union]], as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[legal precedent]] – ''[[stare decisis]]'' – to the facts before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] for civil cases, and the [[Crown Court]] for criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in [[England and Wales]].

These were created in 1994 as [[Government Office]]s, used by the UK government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional government offices were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiers shed as regional government offices disappear |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/29/regional-government-disappears-1500-jobs-lost |work=The Guardian |access-date=16 June 2011 |location=London |first=Hilary |last=Cooper |date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]].&lt;ref name="britannicagov"&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the [[Middle Ages]], with some established as recently as 1974.&lt;ref name="maud"&gt;{{harvnb|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff]]; these posts are used to represent the [[British monarch]] locally.&lt;ref name="britannicagov" /&gt; Outside [[Greater London]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]], England is also divided into 83 [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]]; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government&lt;ref name="localgov"&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|2009|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.

There are six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils.&lt;ref name="localgov" /&gt; In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the [[metropolitan borough]]s. Elsewhere, 27 [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan "shire" counties]] have a [[county council]] and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 [[London borough]]s, plus the [[City of London]] covering a small area at the core governed by the [[City of London Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the most localised level, much of England is divided into [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] with [[Parish councils in England|councils]]; in Greater London only one, [[Queen's Park, London|Queen's Park]], exists {{as of|2014|lc=y}} after they were [[London Government Act 1963|abolished in 1965]] until legislation [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007|allowed their recreation]] in 2007.

The northern uplands include the [[Pennines]], a chain of uplands dividing east and west, the Lake District mountains in Cumbria, and the [[Cheviot Hills]], straddling the border between England and Scotland. The highest point in England, at {{convert|978|m|ft}}, is [[Scafell Pike]] in the Lake District.&lt;ref name="metoffice_nw" /&gt; The [[Shropshire Hills]] are near Wales while [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] are two upland areas in the south-west of the country.

In geological terms, the Pennines, known as the "backbone of England", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the [[Paleozoic Era]] around 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/220026/pennines.html |title=Pennines |publisher=Smmit Post |access-date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their geological composition includes, among others, [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]], and also coal. There are [[karst]] landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. The Pennine landscape is high [[moorland]] in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain two [[national parks in England|national parks]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and the [[Peak District]]. In the [[West Country]], Dartmoor and Exmoor of the Southwest Peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite, and enjoy a [[Climate of south-west England|mild climate]]; both are national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus |title=National Parks&amp;nbsp;– About us |publisher=nationalparks.gov.uk |access-date=5 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027162402/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus |archive-date=27 October 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Lowlands beech forests|English Lowlands]] are in the central and southern regions of the country, consisting of green rolling hills, including the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[Chiltern Hills]], [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]; where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the [[cliffs of Dover]].

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of England}}

England has a [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[maritime climate]]: it is mild with temperatures not much lower than {{convert|0|°C|°F}} in winter and not much higher than {{convert|32|°C|°F}} in summer.&lt;ref name="weather"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the Climate like in Britain? |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/weather/ |publisher=Woodlands Kent |access-date=5 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114052538/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/weather/ |archive-date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the [[Geography of the United Kingdom|English coast]], while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October.&lt;ref name="weather" /&gt; Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.

Important influences on the climate of England are its proximity to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], its northern [[latitude]] and the warming of the sea by the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="weather" /&gt; Rainfall is higher in the west, and parts of the [[Lake District]] receive more rain than anywhere else in the country.&lt;ref name="weather" /&gt; Since weather records began, the highest temperature recorded was {{convert|38.7|°C|°F}} on 25 July 2019 at the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] in [[Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Met Office confirms new UK record temperature of 38.7°C |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/met-office-confirms-new-uk-record-temperature-of-387c |work=The Guardian |access-date=1 August 2019 |date=29 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the lowest was {{convert|−26.1|°C|°F}} on 10 January 1982 in [[Edgmond, Shropshire|Edgmond]], Shropshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=English Climate |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/england/#temperature |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829161614/http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/england/ |archive-date=29 August 2008 |publisher=MetOffice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and wildlife===
{{main|Fauna of England|Fauna of Great Britain}}
[[File:Wood Duck 2, St James's Park, London - April 2012.jpg|thumb| Wood Duck in [[St James's Park]]]]
[[File:Richmond Park - London - England - 02102005.jpg|thumb|Deer in [[Richmond Park]]. The park was created by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in the 17th century as a [[Deer park (England)|deer park]].&lt;ref name= Pastscape&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=397979|mname=Richmond Park|date = 2015|access-date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The fauna of England is similar to that of other areas in the [[British Isles]] with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History Museum|url=https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/british-wildlife.html|access-date=7 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National nature reserves in England]] are designated by [[Natural England]] as key places for [[wildlife]] and natural features in England. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of [[The Wildlife Trusts]] partnership, the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]. There are 229 NNRs in England covering 939 square kilometres (363 square miles). Often they contain rare species or nationally important species of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural England: Designated sites|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/ReportConditionSummary.aspx?SiteType=NNR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environment Agency]] is a [[non-departmental public body]], established in 1995 and sponsored by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] with responsibilities relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Environment Agency|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency|access-date=3 April 2021|website=GOV.UK|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] is the minister responsible for environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-environment-food-and-rural-affairs#:~:text=Current%20role%20holder-,The%20Rt%20Hon%20George%20Eustice%20MP,Affairs%20on%2013%20February%202020.|access-date=3 April 2021|website=www.gov.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England has a [[Oceanic climate|temperate oceanic climate]] in most areas, lacking extremes of cold or heat, but does have a few small areas of [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] and warmer areas in [[South West England|the South West]]. Towards the [[Northern England|North of England]] the climate becomes colder and most of England's mountains and high hills are located here and have a major impact on the climate and thus the local fauna of the areas. [[Deciduous]] woodlands are common across all of England and provide a great habitat for much of England's wildlife, but these give way in northern and upland areas of England to [[coniferous]] forests (mainly plantations) which also benefit certain forms of wildlife. Some species have adapted to the expanded urban environment, particularly the [[red fox]], which is the most successful [[Urban wildlife|urban mammal]] after the [[brown rat]], and other animals such as [[common wood pigeon]], both of which thrive in urban and suburban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2012/may/17/mammals-britains-cities-spotters-guide|title = Mammals in Britain's cities: A spotter's guide - in pictures &amp;#124; Urban wildlife|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grey squirrels]] introduced from eastern America have forced the decline of the native red squirrel due to competition. [[Red squirrels]] are now confined to upland and coniferous-forested areas of England, mainly in the north, south west and Isle of Wight. England's climate is very suitable for lagomorphs and the country has rabbits and brown hares which were introduced in Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/pets/rabbits.shtml |access-date=18 April 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630035620/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/pets/rabbits.shtml |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC Nature – Hare videos, news and facts |website=Bbc.co.uk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/European_Hare |access-date=6 January 2018 |archive-date=10 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110044215/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/European_Hare |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountain hares which are indigenous have now been re-introduced in Derbyshire. The fauna of England has to cope with varying temperatures and conditions, although not extreme they do pose potential challenges and adaptational measures. English fauna has however had to cope with industrialisation, human population densities amongst the highest in [[Europe]] and [[intensive farming]], but as England is a developed nation, wildlife and the countryside have entered the [[English people|English]] mindset more and the country is very conscientious about preserving its wildlife, environment and countryside.&lt;ref&gt;https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/ReportConditionSummary.aspx?SiteType=NNR&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Society started from groups of physicians and [[Natural philosopher|natural philosophers]], meeting at a variety of locations, including [[Gresham College]] in London. They were influenced by the "[[Scientific method|new science]]", as promoted by [[Francis Bacon]] in his ''[[New Atlantis]]'', from approximately 1645 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Syfret (1948) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; A group known as "The Philosophical Society of Oxford" was run under a set of rules still retained by the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name="sy1s"&gt;Syfret (1948) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[English Restoration]], there were regular meetings at Gresham College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Royal Society|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/RS.html|access-date=8 December 2009|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held that these groups were the inspiration for the foundation of the Royal Society.&lt;ref name="sy1s" /&gt;

[[File:St Pancras Railway Station 2012-06-23.jpg|thumb|alt=red stone building with tall clock tower in corner|[[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]] is the UK's 13th busiest railway terminus. The station is one of London's main domestic and international transport hubs providing both commuter rail and high-speed rail services across the UK and to Paris, [[Lille]] and [[Brussels]].]]The [[Department for Transport]] is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. The department is run by the [[Secretary of State for Transport]]. 

England has a dense and modern transportation infrastructure. There are many [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways in England]], and many other trunk roads, such as the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 Great North Road]], which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{harvnb|UK Parliament|2007|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the [[M6 motorway|M6]], from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] through the [[North West England|North West]] up to the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], a distance of {{convert|232|mi}}.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Other major routes include: the [[M1 motorway|M1]] from London to Leeds, the [[M25 motorway|M25]] which encircles London, the [[M60 motorway (Great Britain)|M60]] which encircles Manchester, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] from London to South Wales, the [[M62 motorway|M62]] from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the [[M5 motorway|M5]] from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include [[Arriva UK Bus|Arriva]], [[FirstGroup]], [[Go-Ahead Group]], [[National Express]], [[Rotala]] and [[Stagecoach Group]]. The red [[double-decker bus]]es in London have become a symbol of England. 

[[National Cycle Route]] offers cycling routes nationally. There is a [[rapid transit]] network in two English cities: the [[London Underground]]; and the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Gateshead]] and [[Sunderland]].&lt;ref name="pubwhite"&gt;{{harvnb|White|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several tram networks, such as the [[Blackpool tramway]], [[Manchester Metrolink]], [[Sheffield Supertram]] and [[West Midlands Metro]], and the [[Tramlink]] system centred on Croydon in South London.&lt;ref name="pubwhite" /&gt;

There are plans to reopen lines such as the [[Varsity Line]] between Oxford and Cambridge. These lines are mostly standard gauge ([[single track (rail)|single]], [[double track|double]] or [[quadruple track]]) though there are also a few [[British narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge lines]]. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the [[Channel Tunnel]], which was completed in 1994.

[[Crossrail]], under construction in London, is Europe's largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 January 2012|title=Crossrail's giant tunnelling machines unveiled|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16289051}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High Speed 2]], a new high-speed north–south railway line, projected in 2015 to cost £56 billion is to start being built in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=11 February 2020|title=HS2: When will the line open and how much will it cost?|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16473296|access-date=5 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Health Service (England)|National Health England]] (NHS England) is the publicly funded [[healthcare system]] responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the [[National Health Service Act 1946]]. It was based on the findings of the [[Beveridge Report]], prepared by economist and social reformer [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/beveridge_william.shtml |title=BBC History on William Beveridge |access-date=5 September 2009 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including [[National Insurance]] payments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423153740/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf |archive-date=23 April 2010 |title=NHS Expenditure in England |work=House of Commons Library |access-date=5 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/NHScosts/DH_087013 |title=NHS costs and exemptions |work=Department of Health |access-date=5 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]].

As its name suggests, the [[English language]], today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue spoken by 98% of the population.&lt;ref name=CensusEnglish&gt;[http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/QS205EW/view/2092957699?cols=measures QS205EW – Proficiency in English], ONS 2011 census.

By the 15th century, English was back in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the [[Middle English]] form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the [[English Renaissance]], many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2003|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern English]] has extended this custom of flexibility when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the [[British Empire]], the English language is the world's unofficial ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English: Not America's Language? |url=http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 |first=Mauro E. |last=Mujica |date=19 June 2003 |location=Washington DC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117232711/http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 |archive-date=17 January 2008 |work=The Globalist |access-date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the modern border between Wales and England was established by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], many Welsh-speaking communities found themselves on the English side of the border.

It resulted in a Church that consciously retained a large amount of continuity with the Church of the Patristic and Medieval periods in terms of its use of the catholic creeds, its pattern of ministry, its buildings and aspects of its liturgy, but which also embodied Protestant insights in its theology and in the overall shape of its liturgical practice. The way that this is often expressed is by saying that the Church of England is both 'catholic and reformed.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who are between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an [[Early Years Foundation Stage]] reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. State-funded schools are obliged by law to teach the [[National Curriculum for England|National Curriculum]]; basic areas of learning include English literature, English language, mathematics, science, art &amp; design, citizenship, history, geography, religious education, design &amp; technology, computing, ancient &amp; modern languages, music, and physical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Curriculum|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum|access-date=8 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Early Medieval architecture's]] secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with [[thatch]] for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of [[Early Christian Ireland|Hiberno]]–[[Germanic Christianity|Saxon]] [[monasticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various [[Castles in England]] were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the [[Tower of London]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Durham Castle]] and [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref name="buildings" /&gt;

Throughout the Plantagenet era, an [[English Gothic architecture]] flourished, with prime examples including the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals]] such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[York Minster]].&lt;ref name="buildings"&gt;{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the [[Norman architecture|Norman base]] there was also [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[List of historic houses in England|great houses]], universities and [[parish church]]es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]]; the four-centred arch, now known as the [[Tudor arch]], was a defining feature as were [[wattle and daub]] houses domestically. In the aftermath of the [[Renaissance]] a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the [[English Baroque]] style of architect [[Christopher Wren]] being particularly championed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgian architecture]] followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the [[Royal Crescent]] at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of [[romanticism]] during Victorian period, a [[Gothic Revival]] was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]]. Since the 1930s various [[modernist architecture|modernist]] forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.{{refn|While people such as [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] and [[Richard Rogers]] represent the modernist movement, [[Prince Charles]] since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his [[Poundbury]] development in Dorset.&lt;ref name=ArchCon4&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8045027.stm |work=BBC News |title=Architects to hear Prince appeal |date=12 May 2009 |access-date=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects like [[Raymond Erith]], [[Francis Johnson (architect)|Francis Johnson]] and [[Quinlan Terry]] continued to practise in the classical style.|group=nb}}

Landscape gardening, as developed by [[Capability Brown]], set an international trend for the [[English garden]]. Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gardens through time|url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/histories/gardens-through-time/|access-date=10 April 2021|website=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, the English garden was being imitated by the [[French landscape garden]], and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt; The English landscape garden was centred on the [[English country house]] and manor houses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Folklore ===
{{Main|English folklore}}
[[File:Robin Hood and Maid Marian.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Robin Hood]] and [[Maid Marian]].]]

English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include [[pixie]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]], [[bogeymen]], [[troll]]s, [[goblin]]s and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales featuring [[Offa of Angel]] and [[Wayland the Smith]],&lt;ref name="keary"&gt;{{harvnb|Keary|1882|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others date from after the Norman invasion. The legends featuring [[Robin Hood]] and his [[Merry Men]] of [[Sherwood Forest|Sherwood]], and their battles with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], are among the best-known of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollard|2004|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[High Middle Ages]] tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore and developed into the [[Arthurian myth]].&lt;ref name="woodbbc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Michael |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/arthur_03.shtml |title=King Arthur, 'Once and Future King' |work=BBC News |access-date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="higham1"&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=732}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These were derived from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], Welsh and French sources,&lt;ref name="higham1" /&gt; featuring [[King Arthur]], [[Camelot]], [[Excalibur]], [[Merlin]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]] such as [[Lancelot]]. These stories are most centrally brought together within [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain'').{{refn|These tales may have come to prominence, at least in part, as an attempt by the Norman ruling elite to legitimise their rule of the British Isles, finding [[Anglo-Saxon]] history ill-suited to the task during an era when members of the deposed [[House of Wessex]], especially [[Edgar the Ætheling]] and his nephews of the Scottish [[House of Dunkeld]], were still active in the isles.&lt;ref name=higham1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lacy|1986|p=649}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] explains; "Over the centuries the figure of Arthur became a symbol of British history – a way of explaining the matter of Britain, the relationship between the Saxons and the Celts, and a way of exorcising ghosts and healing the wounds of the past."&lt;ref name=woodbbc /&gt;|group=nb}} Another early figure from [[Britons (historic)|British tradition]], [[King Cole]], may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and [[pseudohistory|pseudo-histories]] make up part of the wider [[Matter of Britain]], a collection of shared British folklore.

Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; [[Lady Godiva]] for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through [[Coventry]], [[Hereward the Wake]] was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, [[Herne the Hunter]] is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] ghost associated with [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] Forest and [[Windsor Great Park|Great Park]] and [[Mother Shipton]] is the archetypal witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|2004|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November people make bonfires, set off [[fireworks]] and eat [[toffee apple]]s in [[Guy Fawkes Night|commemoration]] of the foiling of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] centred on [[Guy Fawkes]]. The chivalrous bandit, such as [[Dick Turpin]], is a recurring character, while [[Blackbeard]] is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as [[Morris dancing]], [[Maypole dance|Maypole dancing]], [[Rapper sword]] in the North East, [[Long Sword dance]] in Yorkshire, [[Mummers Play]]s, [[bottle-kicking]] in Leicestershire, and [[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake|cheese-rolling]] at [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire|Cooper's Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2008|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] associated with cockneys, the [[Queen's Guard|Royal Guard]], the [[Morris dance|Morris costume]] and [[Beefeater]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/costume.html |publisher=Woodlands-Junior.kent.sch.uk |title=What is England's national costume? |access-date=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505015321/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/CUSTOMS/questions/costume.html |archive-date=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[folk music of England]] is centuries old and has contributed to several genres prominently; mostly [[sea shanties]], [[jig]]s, [[hornpipe]]s and [[dance music]]. It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley's]] ''[[Roxburghe Ballads]]'' collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chappell|1966|p=690}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-known songs are ''[[Greensleeves]]'', ''[[Pastime with Good Company]]'', ''[[Maggie May (folk song)|Maggie May]]'' and ''[[Spanish Ladies]]'' amongst others. Many [[nursery rhymes]] are of English origin such as ''[[Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary]]'', ''[[Roses are red]]'', ''[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]'', ''[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]], [[The Grand Old Duke of York]], [[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' and ''[[Humpty Dumpty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lax|1989|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional English Christmas carols include "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]", "[[The First Noel]]", “[[I Saw Three Ships]]” and "[[God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen]]".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Michael Kelly.

Early English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]], followed up by [[Henry Purcell]] from the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]]. German-born [[George Frideric Handel]] spent most of his composing life in London and became a national icon in Britain, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, especially his English oratorios, ''[[Messiah (Handel)|The Messiah]]'', ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'', ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', and ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Birth of British Music: Handel – The Conquering Hero |publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kntl1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514114225/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kntl1|archive-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his four [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|Coronation Anthems]], ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'', composed for the coronation of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], has been performed at every subsequent [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation]], traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. 

Classical music attracted much attention from 1784 with the formation of the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival]], which was the longest running classical music festival of its kind until the final concerts in 1912.  The [[English Musical Renaissance]] was a hypothetical development in the late 19th and early 20th century, when English composers, often those lecturing or trained at the [[Royal College of Music]], were said to have freed themselves from foreign musical influences. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by [[Edward Elgar]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Frederick Delius]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stradling|1993|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day composers from England include [[Michael Nyman]], best known for ''[[The Piano]]'', and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AWaZ1LAFAZEC&amp;dq=lloyd+webber+%22the+most+commercially+successful+composer+in+history.%22 "Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: the new musical"] ''The New York Times''.. referred to Andrew Lloyd Webber as "the most commercially successful composer in history"&lt;/ref&gt;

The St George's Cross has been the national [[flag of England]] since the 13th century. Originally the flag was used by the maritime [[Republic of Genoa]]. The English monarch paid a tribute to the [[Doge of Genoa]] from 1190 onwards so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.
A red cross was a symbol for many [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with [[Saint George]], along with countries and cities, which claimed him as their [[patron saint]] and used his cross as a banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |title=St. George&amp;nbsp;– England's Patron Saint |publisher=Britannia.com |access-date=1 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308175508/http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |archive-date=8 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the [[Union Flag]], a Pan-British flag designed by King [[James I of England|James I]].&lt;ref name="flaghistory" /&gt; During the [[English Civil War]] and [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], the [[New Model Army|New Model Army's]] standards and the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth's]] [[Great Seal of the Realm#Commonwealth|Great Seal]] both incorporated the flag of Saint George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Jonathan|title=The Cult of Saint George in Medieval England|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id&amp;#61;dP8LAQAAMAAJ&amp;#61;&amp;quot;as+a+contrast+to+the+Union+flag+of+the&amp;quot; 149] |year=2009 |publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-469-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great Seal of the Commonwealth of England, 1651 |website=Getty Images |url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/the-great-seal-of-the-commonwealth-of-england-1651-news-photo/463967983 | access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
