      <text bytes="100">Let's make sure that you're not only checking within a single line. 
	      We might have an open bracket on one line [[
	      with some text to exclude...
	      ]] and the closing bracket on another line. 
	      Same goes for the other types of brackets, braces, and so on that we want to skip {{
	      skip me 
	      }}
	      don't skip me.
